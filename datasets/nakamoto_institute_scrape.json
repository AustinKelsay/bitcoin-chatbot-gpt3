Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."}

While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party."}

Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."}

For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced[1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received.

The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash."}

The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes.

One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.

Over many centuries of cultural evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related to it, encoded into common law.

A canonical real-life example, which we might consider to be the primitive ancestor of smart contracts, is the humble vending machine. Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the till should be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism), the machine takes in coins, and via a simple mechanism, which makes a freshman computer science problem in design with finite automata, dispense change and product according to the displayed price. The vending machine is a contract with bearer: anybody with coins can participate in an exchange with the vendor. The lockbox and other security mechanisms protect the stored coins and contents from attackers, sufficiently to allow profitable deployment of vending machines in a wide variety of areas."}

The smart contract design strategy suggests that we successively refine security protocols to more fully embed in a property the contractual terms which deal with it. These protocols would give control of the cryptographic keys for operating the property to the person who rightfully owns that property, based on the terms of the contract. In the most straightforward implementation, the car can be rendered inoperable unless the proper challenge-response protocol is completed with its rightful owner, preventing theft. But if the car is being used to secure credit, strong security implemented in this traditional way would create a headache for the creditor \u2013 the repo man would no longer be able to confiscate a deadbeat's car. To redress this problem, we can create a smart lien protocol: if the owner fails to make payments, the smart contract invokes the lien protocol, which returns control of the car keys to the bank. This protocol might be much cheaper and more effective than a repo man. A further reification would provably remove the lien when the loan has been paid off, as well as account for hardship and operational exceptions. For example, it would be rude to revoke operation of the car while it's doing 75 down the freeway."}

To continue with our example, if the automobile contract were a lease, the final payment would switch off leasee access; for purchase on credit, it would switch off creditor access. A security system, by successive redesign, increasingly approaches the logic of the contract which governs the rights and obligations covering the object, information, or computation being secured.

This problem crops up in many areas in both auditing and smart contracts. To illustrate, here are two common control techniques:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/formalizing-securing-relationships/", "title": "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks", "text": "Imprest: this is a family of controls involving the receipt or disbursement of bearer certificates (usually notes and coins). One example is the protocol used at most movie theaters. Entry is segregated from payment by introducing tickets and establishing two employee roles, the ticket seller in a booth, and the ticket stub salesman at the entrance. Periodically, a bookkeeper reconciles the number of tickets with the total paid. Discrepancy again indicates fraud or error."}

Segregation of duties is an instance of the principle of required conspiracy. For example, the functions of warehouse/delivery, sales, and receipt of payments are each performed by different parties, with a policy that each party reports every transaction to a fourth function, accounting. Any singular reported activity (e.g., delivery without receipt of payment) indicates potential fraud (e.g., a delivery was made to a customer and the payment pocketed instead of being put into the corporate treasury). Segregation of duties is the auditor's favorite tool. Where it is absent the auditor cries \"foul\", just as a good engineer would react to a single point of failure. Many cryptographic systems have rightfully gone down to commercial failure because they ground down to trust in a single entity rather than segregating functions so as to require conspiracy."}

Control protocols, developed in the era of paper, are based on static forms passed as messages and processed in tables and spreadsheets. Controls focus on money and counts of standardized goods and service events, easily recorded by numbers and manipulated by arithmetic, while mostly ignoring other kinds or aspects of contractual performance. Checksums on numbers, the basis of reconciliation, are crude and forgeable compared to cryptographic hashes. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) keeps these static forms and maintains reliance on controls. It uses cryptographic hashes for nothing more sophisticated than integrity checks on individual messages."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/formalizing-securing-relationships/", "title": "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks", "text": "Controls place little emphasis on confidentiality, at least in the modern accounting literature. The emphasis on confidentiality in paper-era protocols is lacking because violation of often implicit confidences, via replication of data, was much more difficult with paper. Furthermore, technologies for protecting confidentiality while auditing were not feasible. Businesses traditionally trusted accounting firms with confidences, a trust that has eroded over the last century, and will erode still further as accounting firms start taking advantage of the vast amounts of inside and marketing information they are collecting from their customers' databases during audits. Using paper-based protocols in a digital world, there are few effective controls against the auditors themselves. Post-unforgeable transaction logs and multiparty secure computation, discussed below, indicate the possibility of cryptographic protocols to implement less relavatory but more effective auditing trails and controls; their use may be able to ameliorate the growing problems with data mining and breach of confidentiality."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/formalizing-securing-relationships/", "title": "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks", "text": "Auditors place quite a bit of trust in management to authorize transactions in a secure and productive manner. Objecting to this dual trust in management and distrust of employees inherent in the accounting tradition, there has been a trend in the last two decades towards a loosening of controls as a part of hierarchy flattening and empowerment of professional employees. Unfortunately, loose controls have led to several recent scandals in the banking and investment trade. The most recent view is that there must be a learned tradeoff between controls and empowerment. The smart contract view is that we need smarter controls, originating at the ownership of the company, and entailing less asymmetry between management and other professional employees. This means converting many implicit employee contracts to more explicit smart contracts based on more direct relationships between owners (or at least their directors) and employees, and symmetric formalizations between employees."}

They are highly evolved, hundreds of years old (double-entry bookkeeping, for example, predates the Renaissance). Smart contracts will incorporate many techniques and strategies from control protocols, such as generation of an initial record, segregation of duties, and reconciliation. It will not be long, however, before smart contracts start augmenting and transforming traditional business procedures, making a wide variety of new business structures possible and in the long run replacing traditional controls."}

The most traditional kind of cryptography is secret key cryptography, in which Alice and Bob (our exemplar parties to a smart contract) use a single shared, prearranged key to encrypt messages between them. A fundamental problem we will see throughout these protocols is the need to keep keys secret, and public key cryptography helps solve this. In this technique, Alice generates two keys, called the private and public keys. She keeps the private key secret and well protected, and publishes the public key. When Bob wishes to send a message to Alice, he encrypts a message with her public key, sends the encrypted message, and she decrypts the message with her private key. The private key provides a \"trapdoor\" that allows Alice to compute an easy inverse of the encryption function that used the public key.

In many Asian countries, a hand-carved wooden block, called a \"chop\", is often used instead of autographs. Every chop is unique, and because of the unique carving and wood grain cannot be copied. A digital signature is similar to the chop, since every newly generated key is unique, but it is trivial to copy the key if obtained from the holder.

With chargebacks customers can get refunds on allegedly unwanted merchandise. The issuer tracks the number of chargebacks both for customers and merchants; too many chargebacks can get you booted out of the system. This provides an efficient mechanism for refunds without resorting to expensive tort proceedings. Many customers who read the fine print or otherwise learn about chargeback limits often do chargebacks despite receiving and enjoying the merchandise; there is no practical way for the issuer to detect such fraud, and so it can only be pruned by limiting the number of chargebacks per customer. Some merchants complain vociferously about such customer \"theft\", and it seems to make possible coordinated attacks to put merchants out of business, but nevertheless merchants sign up for credit cards, because that's what their customers have signed up for. The chargeback feature makes customers more comfortable purchasing goods of unknown quality, especially mail-order and over the Internet. Chargeback provides a crude but effective partial solution to the information asymmetry problem between retailers and consumers."}

These can be implemented by a digital mint expiring or activating special issues of digital cash, or by a third party issuing escrowed keys at specific times. Since these keys are encrypted against the escrow agent, and that agent doesn't know what they will be used for, the escrow agent has no incentive to cheat. A generalization of this is that transfer and redeemability are each associated with interval sets, or validity periods when each can and cannot be performed. This is analogous to clipping coupons on bonds."}

The identity of the potential borrowers is still public, as well as the system for enforcing payment, but the actual amount loaned or borrowed remains unknown. The system starts with participants putting unknown amounts into a pot and getting receipts (bearer bonds) for these amount. All participants then borrow a standard amount. Whether a participant is a net borrower or a net creditor, and of what amount, remains private. When the loan is due all participants repay the standard amount, and the creditors reclaim the amounts on their bearer bonds. The amount actually borrowed (or, if negative, loaned) is the public amount borrowed minus the amount put into the pot. One consequence is that while negative reputations can still be accumulated when participants fail to pay back the standard amount, positive reputations are minimal, since participants who borrow and loan are indistinguishable. If future creditors put stock in positive participation, one could gain a credit rating by perpetually participating as a net borrower of zero, by loaning and borrowing the same amounts."}

A law degree is not required to use the language, but some familiarity with contract law and the drafting of contracts is recommended. A lawyer who did reasonably well on the analytical and logical sections of the U.S. LSAT or its overseas equivalent, will, I suspect, have better luck drafting contracts in this language than than a programmer whose sole experience lies in traditional procedural language. That is why I call this a drafting language not a programming language."}

These two characteristics make our language very different from special purpose financial contract languages such as[4].

On the other hand, the language is not very good at expressing many subjective and ambiguous concepts that are often necessary in contracts. Nor is it any good, in its present state, in referring to jurisdictions or doctrines of law. The language is nevertheless very different from a traditional programming language.

More sophisticated schedules are possible, such as those that minimize delivery costs for the Counterparty by delivering to different Holders on different days in July. Fortunately, we can hide these scheduling details within the calendar event and schedule iterator mechanisms, leaving the drafter free from worrying about exactly when markets are open, which days are weekends or holidays or leap days, and the like.

The above contract combined these two, along with damage clauses, in a clever way. None of the above parties had any intention of travelling to Byzantium, or even outside Genoa, to perform on this contract. Its logic can be analyzed as follows (the Holder is the creditor). We've added the statements \"in (geographic location)\", security, and foreclose to highlight important aspects of this contract. The latter sells enough of the goods at auction to satisfy penalty (if there was not enough to satisfy the creditors there was a bankruptcy procedure to fairly allocate the remain security among the creditors, but this is not shown):"}

Another interpretation of the latter clause is that it would only refer to a value of goods up to the double penalty amount, but the goods could be chosen from among all the goods of the debtor and the co-signer.

The property is represented by titles: names referring to the property, and the public key corresponding to a private key held by its current owner, signed by the previous owner, along with a chain of previous such titles. Title names may \"completely\" describe the property, for example allocations in a namspace. (Of course, names always refer to something, the semantics, so such a description is not really complete). Or the title names might simply be labels referring to the property. Various descriptions and rules \u2013 maps, deeds, and so on \u2013 may be included."}

In particular it is a \"constitutional microdemocracy\" with low entry and exit costs. After the rules of property transfer have been decided, each vote should stay within this constitution \u2013 so that normally the vote will simply implement a distributed operation according to the property rules. The voting is necessary not due to a democratic political ideology but because it is the optimal result in analysis of distributed databases with malicious attackers.[6] If the rules are violated by the winning voters, the correct losers can exit the group and reform a new group, inheriting the old titles. Users of the titles (relying parties) who wish to maintain correct titles can securely verify for themselves which splinter group has correctly followed the rules and switch to the correct group. If the rules are violated by losing voters, they can be excluded from further participation both by correct winners and rule-following relying parties."}

Thus in practice users should not \"put all their eggs in one basket\", but different title clubs should be used for different kinds of property. Note that the key security feature of the club is not the voting, but a set of objective, often automated, rules and an unforgeable audit trail that allows both club members and relying parties to check whether each vote followed the rules. So, to go further with the political metaphor, a property club is a \"constitutional microdemocracy\" with most of the emphasis on the \"constitutional\". The voting is necessary, but is quite regulated."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/", "title": "Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority", "text": "To implement a property club, we set up a replicated database so that the club members, hereafter \"servers\", can securely maintain titles of ownership, and securely transfer them upon the request of current owners.

The purpose of the replicated database is simply to securely agree on who owns what. The entire database is public."}

A good model of secure replicated databases is the \"Byzantine Quorum System\" of Malkhi & Reiter[6]. In contrast to most recent work in peer-to-peer software, our design is based on mathematical proofs of security rather than hand-waving. For a short discussion of such threshold-of-servers approaches, see my essay \"Coalition Design for Secure Protocols\". The database is replicated across a universe of servers U, |U|=n. The \"quorum system\" is a collection of subsets (quora) of these servers, each pair of which intersect. Each quorum can operate on behalf of the system; intersection guarantees that operations done on distinct quora preserve consistency. A quorum system tolerant of Byzantine (unconditionally malicious) server failures is a collection of subsets of servers, each pair of which intersect in a set containing sufficiently many correct servers to guarantee the consistency of the replicated data. The authors construct a protocol such that any intersection contains at least 2f+1 servers, thus providing resilience against up to f malicious servers, n > 4f."}

Possession of this private key is required to sign over title; multiparty threshold signatures could also be handled. So it may be a good idea to use one keypair for each combination of title and current owner, rather than keypairs representing the identities of owners. When certain contractual conditions are met, such as the last payment on a loan, this could trigger the generation of a new keypair held solely by the owner, and transfer of title from the shared keypair to the new keypair."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/", "title": "Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority", "text": "This method doesn't attempt to define or utilize a state of \"disuse\". Instead it equates activity of the property with the ongoing active online presence of an owner who knows about the title and wishes to continue ownership. Cost of maintaining the title might be made high by requiring a periodic registry fee from owners. However, this introduces the problem of who obtains the benefit, by property club rules, of the profits from this fee, and the problem of that the fee lowers the profit of owning the property, even perhaps making it negative. One possibility, where costs of protecting the property are high, is to charge a \"Georgian tax\" based on some imprecise but objective estimate of the value potential of the property, and allocate the fees to the task of securing the property. To come up with this estimate, or to account for usage of the property itself, would involve mechanisms or observation of characteristics specific to the kind of property, to which subject we now turn."}

When names are property, a name may violate a pre-existing trademark, causing the confusion that both the new namespace and the old trademark namespace were designed to solve."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/", "title": "Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority", "text": "Another solution is to examine the incentives of the titled owner, to see if they correspond to truthfully claiming control over a resource. In most cases there may be incentive to lie, and we can't use this method. In some cases there is incentive to tell the truth and we can, with caveats, rely on it. Any such incentive assumption in the property rules should be explicated, so that relying parties can examine whether the conditions creating the incentive still hold."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/", "title": "Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority", "text": "Another solution is for property club rules and the registry to originally incorporate rich information about the actual state of property, and modify the actual ownership and transfer on this property based on that state, in a way that leaves few ambiguities so it can be fully audited by club members and third parties. It is most advantageous when this auditing can remain automated, as envisioned above. However the introduction as rule criteria of unrecorded (or unsecurely recorded) transient states common in physical property causes auditing, and thus the titles, to become both less secure and more expensive."}

A TTP that must be trusted by all users of a protocol becomes an arbiter of who may and may not use the protocol. So that, for example, to run a secure SSL web server, or to participate in S/MIME, one must obtain a certifcate from a mutually trusted certificate authority.

A more valuable use for remote attestation is for verifying the behavior of servers. This is also called the transparent server approach. Through remote attestation, clients can verify that the specific desired code is running on a server. Combined with the ability to audit that code as open source, remote attestation of servers can greatly decrease the vulnerability of clients and users to the server. Given the importance of the trusted third party problem we have discussed here, this approach has vast potential to convert trusted third party protocols into secure protocols, and to make possible a wide variety of secure protocols that were heretofore impossible. For example, Hal Finney has implemented a version of bit gold called reusable proofs of work, based on a secure coprrocessor board that allows users to remotely attest the code running on the card. While one still needs to trust the manufacturer of the card, this manufacturer is separated from the installation of server code onto and the operation of the server on the card."}

If the attack one needs a TTP to protect against is not a serious real-world threat in the context of the application the designer is trying to secure, it is better to simply leave the small hole unplugged than to assign the task to a TTP. In the case of public key cryptography, for example, protocol designers haven't figured out how to prevent a \"man-in-the-middle\" (MITM) attack during the initial key exchange. SSL tried to prevent this by requiring CAs as trusted third parties, as described above, and this solution cost the web community billions of dollars in certificate fees and lost opportunities to secure communications. SSH, on the other hand, decided to simply leave this small hole unplugged. The MITM hole has, to the best of my knowledge, never even once been exploited to compromise the privacy of an SSH user, yet SSH is far more widely used to protect privacy than SSL, at a tiny fraction of the cost. This economical approach to security has been looked at at greater length by Ian Grigg."}

The class of parties is little-known because security protocol designers typically don't know much about the traditional non-digital security, legal, and institutional solutions needed to make such a party trustworthy.

That \"trust\" can take on practically opposite meanings, depending upon the context, is another strong argument for avoiding use of the word when describing the vulnerabilities, or lack thereof, of security protocols. Whether a designer thinks he does or must trust some generic class of parties is one thing. Whether a particular user will actually trust a particular entity in that class when the protocol actually runs is quite another matter.

The latter strategy has given rise to the most promising areas of security protocol research including digital mixes, multiparty private computations, and Byzantine resiliant databases. These and similar implementations will be used to radically reduce the cost of current TTPs and to solve the many outstanding problems in privacy, integrity, property rights, and contract enforcement while minimizing the very high costs of creating and operating new TTP institutions."}

I will first describe the Chaumian protocol and its innovative privacy feature. I will then discuss how these ideas map to the world of capabilities in the section on generic vs. specific rights. I have altered digital cash terminology from digital cash to bearer certificate or token, from mint to issuer or transfer agent, and so on to reflect the ability of Chaum's protocols to generalize. Chaumian bearer certificates implement standardized rights transferable regardless of the identity of the holder. Each kind of contract (for example, each denomination of \"coin\" in digital cash) corresponds to a digital signature, just as each issue of Federal Reserve Notes or stock certificates corresponds to a particular plate."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/contracts-with-bearer/", "title": "Contracts with Bearer", "text": "In the most straightforward Chaumian protocol, the issuer and transfer agent (the same entity, for our purposes, though they can easily be unbundled) create a serial number (really a large unguessable random number, rather than a sequence), and append it to a list of issued certificates. The transfer agent clears a transfer (i.e., redeems the certificate) by checking the signature to identify the class of bearer contract and verify that it was made, then looking on that contract's issued list to make sure the serial number is there, then removing the serial number. Alternatively, the issuer can let the issuee make up the serial number, then, when cleared, check the signature and put the number on the list of cleared certificates. The signature provides the assurance that the certificate is indeed the the particular kind of contract with bearer, while the serial number assures that the same instance of that contract is not cleared or redeemed more than once. In these simple versions, the transfer agent can link the transferee to the transferor for all transfers. To implement the privacy characteristics of coins and physical bearer certificates, we need to add unlinkability features."}

The goal where true names are used (this occurs, for example, when using true name accounts or not using good communications mixes), is to prevent third party linking of two people doing business with each other. Where nyms are used the goal is to minimize the release of traffic information, to prevent the unwanted accumulation of unique behavior patterns, which could be used to link nyms (including to their true names), or could augment other means of breaching privacy.

On the other hand, \"A one hour block on DSS-60 in May\" and \"the right to lock autoexec.bat at some point\" are generic and can be transferred privately with the much less expensive blinding, given a sufficient population of other tokens for this class of generic right transfered between the issuance and consumption of a given token."}

Fault tolerance can provide robustness against a minority, so that it takes a majority dropping out to halt the protocol, or it can be nonrobust but fail-stop, so that a single participant can terminate the protocol. Many papers have discussed the fraction of parties one must trust in order to be assured of learning the correct output. In traditional results, fairness and privacy could not both be achieved with a faulty majority. Recent papers[3][4][5][6] have produced fair and private protocols even with faulty majorities. They trade robustness for privacy and fairness against any proportion of faulty parties. The advantage of this fail-stop approach is that one can usually find new partners and start over again, but one does not want to suffer irreversible losses such as leaking information, being left holding the bag, or being convinced of an incorrect result."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-god-protocols/", "title": "The God Protocols", "text": "Multiparty computation theory, by making possible privy virtual intermediation, has major implications, in theory, for all kinds of contractual relationships. This can be seen most clearly in the area of negotiations. A \"mechanism\" in economics is an abstract model of an institution which communicates with its participants via messages, and whose rules can be specified algorithmically. These institutions can be auctions, exchanges, voting, and so on. They typically implement some kind of negotiation or decision making process."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-god-protocols/", "title": "The God Protocols", "text": "Economists assume a trusted intermediary operates the mechanism. Here's a simple example of using this virtual computer for a mechanism. Alice can submit a bid price, and Bob an ask price, then their shared virtual program which has one instruction, \"A greater than B?\". The computer then returns \"true\" if Alice's bid is greater than Bob's offer. A slightly more sophisticated computer may then decide the settlement price according to a number of different algorithms (Alice's bid, Bob's ask, split the difference, etc.) This implements the mechanism \"blind bargaining\" with no trusted intermediary."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-god-protocols/", "title": "The God Protocols", "text": "In principle, since any computable problem can be solved on this virtual computer (they are \"Turing complete\"), any computable economic mechanism can be implemented without a trusted intermediary. In practice, we face the three limitations discussed above. But the existence proof, that any economic mechanism can be run without a trusted intermediary, is very exciting. This means that, in principle, any contract which can be negotiated through a trusted third party (such as an auction or exchange) can be negotiated directly. So, in some abstract sense, the only remaining \"hard\" problems in smart contract negotiations are (a) problems considered hard even with a trusted intermediary (for the standard economic reasons), and (b) the task of algorithmically specifying the negotiating rules and output contract terms (This includes cases where an intermediary adds knowledge unavailable to the participants, such as a lawyer giving advice on how to draft a contract). In practice, many problems which can be solved in principle with multiparty computation will re-arise when we implement protocols in an efficient, practical manner. The God Protocols give us a target to shoot for."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-god-protocols/", "title": "The God Protocols", "text": "Applying this kind of analysis to the performance phase of contracts is less straightforward. For starters, economic theories of the performance phase are not as well developed or simple as the mechanism theory of negotiations. Indeed, most economic theory simply assumes that all contraccts can be perfectly and costlessly enforced. Some of the \"transaction cost\" literature has started to move beyond this assumption, but there are few compelling results or consensus theories in the area of techniques and costs of contract enforcement."}

Smith proved that these genes, competing to be propagated into future generations, will evolve strategies that are Nash equilibria to the strategic problems presented by the competition.

In some highly constrained cases, there is also ongoing cooperation between non-kin, which evolutionary psychologists call reciprocal altruism. As Dawkins describes it[D89], unless an exchange of favors is simultaneous (and sometimes even then), one party or the other can cheat. And they usually do. This is the typical result of a game theorists call the Prisoner's Dilemma \u2013 if both parties cooperated, both would be better off, but if one cheats, he gains at the expense of the sucker. In a population of cheaters and suckers, the cheaters always win. However, sometimes animals come to cooperate through repeated interactions and a strategy called Tit-for-Tat: start cooperating and keep cooperating until the other party cheats \u2013 then defect yourself. This threat of retaliation motivates continued cooperation."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/", "title": "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money", "text": "The situations where such cooperation in fact occurs in the animal world are highly constrained. The main constraint is that such cooperation is restricted to relationships where at least one of the participants is more or less forced to be in the proximity of the other. The most common case is when parasites, and hosts whose bodies they share, evolve into symbiotes. If the interests of the parasite and the host coincide, so that both working together would be more fit than either on their own, (i.e. the parasite is also providing some benefit to the host), then, if they can play a successful game of Tit-for-Tat, they will evolve into symbiosis \u2013 a state where their interests, and especially the exit mechanism of genes from one generation to the next, coincides. They become as a single organism. However, there is much more than cooperation going on here \u2013 there is also exploitation. They occur simultaneously.

These fish swim in and out of the mouths of their hosts, eating the bacteria there, benefiting the host fish. The host fish could cheat \u2013 it could wait for the cleaner to finish its job, then eat it. But they don't. Since they are both mobile, they are both potentially free to leave the relationship. However, the cleaner fish have evolved a very strong sense of individual territoriality, and have stripes and dances that are difficult to spoof \u2013 much like a difficult to forge brand logo. So the host fish know where to go to get cleaned \u2013 and they know that if they cheat, they will have to start over again with a new distrustful cleaner fish. The entrance costs, and thus the exit costs, of the relationship are high, so that it works out without cheating. Besides, the cleaner fish are tiny, so the benefit of eating them is not large compared to the benefit of a small number of, or even one, cleaning."}

To demonstrate these were cases of reciprocal altruism, Wilkinson combined the populations of bats from two different groups. Bats, with very rare exception, only fed old friends from their original group.[D89] Such cooperation requires building a long-term relationship, where partners interact often, recognize each other, and keep track of each other's behavior.

Such social positions were more valuable than the tangible forms of wealth in many hunter-gatherer cultures. Examples of such positions included clan leaders, war party leaders, hunting party leaders, membership in a particular long-term trading partnership (with a particular person in a neighboring clan or tribe), midwives, and religious healers. Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege. Upon death, to maintain order, the heirs to such positions had to be quickly and clearly determined. Delays could spawn vicious conflicts. Thus, a common event was the mortuary feast, in which the deceased was feted while both his tangible and intangible forms of wealth were distributed to descendants, as determined by custom, clan decision-makers, or the will of the deceased."}

Westerners thus usually translated the rich variety of words natives had for their exchange institutions, rights, and obligations as \"gift\".

One solution is imposing an ongoing service obligation from the groom or his clan to the bride's clan. This occurs in about 15% of known cultures[DW88]. In a much larger number, 67%, the groom or groom's clan pays the brides clan a substantial amount of wealth. Some of this bride price is paid in immediate consumables, in plants to be gathered harvested and animals slaughtered for the marriage feast. In herding or agricultural societies much of the bride price is paid in livestock, a long lasting form of wealth. The balance, and usually the most valuable portion of the bride-price in cultures without livestock, is paid with what are usually the most valuable family heirlooms \u2013 the rarest, costliest, and most durable pendants, rings, and so on.

For the losers, collectibles buried in caches provided a way to \"under-report\", leading the victors to believe the losers were less wealthy and thus demand less than they might.

The result: the tribes that are hurt tend to shrink. The tribes that benefit pay less tribute than could be extracted. In both cases, less revenue is generated for the victors than they might be able to get with better rules. This is an application of the Laffer curve to the fortunes of specific tribes. On this curve, applied to income taxes by the brilliant economist Arthur Laffer, as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and most of all disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. At a certain rate due to these reasons tax revenues are optimized. Hiking the tax rate beyond the Laffer optimum results in lower rather than higher revenues for the government. Ironically, the Laffer curve was used by advocates for lower taxes, even though it is a theory of tax collection optimum to government revenue, not a theory of tax collection optimal to social welfare or individual preference satisfaction."}

Charles Adams[A90] uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives \u2013 both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments \u2013 to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors. Democratic governments may maintain high tax revenues over historical time by more peaceful means than conquering underfunded states. They are the first states in history with tax revenues so high relative to external threats that they have the luxury of spending most of the money in non-military areas. Their tax regimes have operated closer to the Laffer optimum than those of most previous kinds of governments. (Alternatively, this luxury may be made possible by the efficiency of nuclear weapons in deterring attack rather than the increased incentives of democracies to optimize to tax collection). When we apply the Laffer curve to examining the relative impact of treaty tributterms on various tribes, we conclude that the desire to optimize revenues causes victors to want to accurately measure the income and wealth of the vanquished. Measuring value is crucial to determining the tributaries' incentives to avoid or evade the tribute by hiding wealth, fight, or flight. For their part, tributaries can and do spoof these measurements in various ways, for example by burying collectibles in caches. Tribute collection involves a measurement game with unaligned incentives."}

Today, most large animals on the planet are afraid of projectiles \u2013 an adaption to only one species of predator [R97]. Cultures based more on gathering than hunting also greatly benefitted. A population explosion followed \u2013 Homo sapiens sapiens was able to populate more parts of the planet and at a density over ten times that of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis [C94], despite weaker bones and no increase in brain size.

This constellation of human desires might be called the collecting instinct. Searching for the raw materials, such as shells and teeth, and manufacturing of collectibles took up a considerable portion of many ancient humans' time, just as many modern humans expend substantial resources on these activities as hobbies.

Test systems had already acquired 0,1,2,3 and thus 4 was the next. DigiCash's marketing assumptions then changed to assume one issue per country. In time, this scheme was adjusted to issue currencies numbered after international dialling codes (e.g., 49 for Germany, 61 for Australia). The shortfalls of this scheme became apparent, so a new design was created [4].

Then, certificates would circulate as rights or contracts, in much the same way as the share certificates of old and thus replace centralised accounting systems[6]. These ideas took financial cryptography part of the way there. Although they showed how to strongly verify each transaction, they stopped short of placing the the digital signature in an overall framework of accountancy and governance. A needed step was to add in the redundancy implied in double entry bookkeeping in order to protect both the transacting agents and the system operators from fraud."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Designs that derived from the characteristics of the Internet, the capabilities of cryptography and the needs of governance led to the development of the signed receipt[7]. In order to develop this concept, let us assume a simple three party payment system, wherein each party holds an authorising key which can be used to sign their instructions. We call these players Alice, Bob (two users) and Ivan (the Issuer) for convenience."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "When Alice wishes to transfer value to Bob in some unit or contract managed by Ivan, she writes out the payment instruction and signs it digitally, much like a cheque is dealt with in the physical world. She sends this to the server, Ivan, and he presumably agrees and does the transfer in his internal set of books. He then issues a receipt and signs it with his signing key. As an important part of the protocol, Ivan then reliably delivers the signed receipt to both Alice and Bob, and they can update their internal books accordingly."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Our concept of digital value sought to eliminate as many risks as possible. This was derived simply from one of the high level requirements, that of being extremely efficient at issuance of value. Efficiency in digital issuance is primarily a function of support costs, and a major determinant of support costs is the costs of fraud and theft."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "One risk that consistently blew away any design for efficient digital value at reasonable cost was the risk of insider fraud. In our model of many users and a single centralised server, the issuers of the unit of digital value (as signatory to the contract) and any governance partners such as the server operators are powerful candidates for insider fraud. Events over the last few years such as the mutual funds and stockgate scandals are canonical cases of risks that we decided to address."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "In order to address the risk of insider fraud, the written receipt was historically introduced as being a primary source of evidence. Mostly forgotten to the buying public these days, the purpose of a written receipt in normal retail trade is not to permit returns and complaints by the customer, but rather to engage her in a protocol of documentation that binds the shop attendant into safekeeping of the monies. A good customer will notice fraud by the shop attendant and warn the owner to look out for the monies identified by the receipt; the same story applies to the invention of the cash till or register, which was originally just a box separating the owner's takings from the monies in the shop attendant's pockets. We extend this primary motive into the digital world by using a signed receipt to bind the Issuer into a governance protocol with the users."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "We also go several steps further forward. Firstly, to achieve a complete binding, Alice's original authorisation is also included within the record. The receipt then includes all the evidence of both the user's intention and the server's action in response, and it now becomes a dominating record of the event. This then means that the most efficient record keeping strategy is to drop all prior records and keep safe the signed receipt."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "This domination affects both the Issuer and the user, and allows us to state the following principle:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "As the signed receipt is delivered from Issuer to both users, all three parties hold the same dominating record for each event. This reduces support costs by dramatically reducing problems caused by differences in information."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Secondly, we bind a signed contract of issuance known as a Ricardian Contract into the receipt[8]. This invention relates a digitally signed document securely to the signed receipt by means of a unique identifier called a message digest, again provided by cryptography. It provides strong binding for the unit of account, the nature of the issue, the terms, conditions and promises being made by the Issuer, and of course the identity of the Issuer."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Finally, with these enabling steps in place, we can now introduce the principle:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Within the full record of the signed receipt, the user's intention is expressed, and is fully confirmed by the server's response. Both of these are covered by digital signatures, locking these data down. A reviewer such as an auditor can confirm the two sets of data, and can verify the signatures."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The principle of the Receipt as the Transaction has become sacrosact over time. In our client software, the principle has been hammered into the design consistently, resulting in a simplified accounting regime, and delivering a high reliability. Issues still remain, such as the loss of receipts and the counting of balances by the client side software, but these become reasonably tractable once the goal of receipts as transactions is placed paramount in the designer's mind."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "In order to calculate balances on a related set of receipts, or to present a transaction history, a book would be constructed on the fly from the set. This amounts to using the Signed Receipt as a basis for single entry bookkeeping. In effect, the bookkeeping is derived from the raw receipts, and this raises the question as to whether to keep the books in place."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The principles of Relational Databases provide guidance here. The fourth normal form directs that we store the primary records, in this case the set of receipts, and we construct derivative records, the accounting books, on the fly[9]."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Similar issues arise for Ivan the Issuer. The server has to accept each new transaction on the basis of the available balance in the effected books; for this reason Ivan needs those books to be available efficiently. Due to the greater number of receipts and books (one for each user account), both receipts and books will tend to exist, in direct contrast to fourth normal form. A meld between relationally sound sets of receipts and double entry books comes to assist here."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Alice and Bob both are granted a book each within the server's architecture. As is customary, we place those books on the liabilities side. Receipts then can be placed in a separate single book and this could be logically placed on the assets side. Each transaction from Alice to Bob now has a logical contra entry, and is then represented in 3 places within the accounts of the server. Yet, the assets side remains in fourth normal form terms as the liabilities entries are derived, each pair from one entry on the assets side."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "By extension, a more sophisticated client-side software agent, working for Alice or Bob, could employ the same techniques. At this extreme, entries are now in place in three separate locations, and each holding potentially three records."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The digitally signed receipt, with the entire authorisation for a transaction, represents a dramatic challenge to double entry bookkeeping at least at the conceptual level. The cryptographic invention of the digital signature gives powerful evidentiary force to the receipt, and in practice reduces the accounting problem to one of the receipt's presence or its absence. This problem is solved by sharing the records \u2013 each of the agents has a good copy."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "In some strict sense of relational database theory, double entry book keeping is now redundant; it is normalised away by the fourth normal form. Yet this is more a statement of theory than practice, and in the software systems that we have built, the two remain together, working mostly hand in hand."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Which leads to the pairs of double entries connected by the central list of receipts; three entries for each transaction. Not only is each accounting agent led to keep three entries, the natural roles of a transaction are of three parties, leading to three by three entries."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "We term this triple entry bookkeeping. Although the digitally signed receipt dominates in information terms, in processing terms it falls short. Double entry book keeping fills in the processing gap, and thus the two will work better together than apart. In this sense, our term of triple entry bookkeeping recommends an advance in accounting, rather than a revolution."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The precise layout of the entries in software and data terms is not settled, and may ultimately become one of those ephemeral implementation issues. The signed receipts may form a natural asset-side contra account, or they may be a separate non-book list underlying the bookkeeping system and its two sides."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Auditing issues arise where construction of the books derives from the receipts, and normalisation issues arise when a receipt is lost. These are issues for future research."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Likewise, it is worth stating that the technique of signing receipts works both with private key signatures and also with entanglement message digest signatures; whether the security aspects of these techniques is adequate to task is dependent on the business environment."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "It will be noted that the above design of triple entry bookkeeping assumed that Alice and Bob were agents of some independence. This was made possible, and reflected the usage of the system as a digital cash system, and not as a classical accounting system."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Far from reducing the relevance of this work to the accounting profession, it introduces digital cash as an alternate to corporate bookkeeping. If an accounting system for a corporation or other administrative entity is recast as a system of digital cash, or internal money, then experience shows that benefits accrue to the organisation."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Although the core of the system looks exactly like an accounting system, each department's books are pushed out as digital cash accounts. Departments no longer work so much with budgets as have control over their own corporate money. Fundamental governance control is still held within the accounting department by dint of their operation of the system, and by the limited scope of the money as only being usable within the organisation; the accounting department might step in as a market maker, exchanging payments in internal money for payments in external money to outside suppliers."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "We have operated this system on a small scale. Rather than be inefficient on such a small scale, the system has generated dramatic savings in coordination. No longer are bills and salaries paid using conventional monies; many transactions are dealt with by internal money transfers and at the edges of the corporation, formal and informal agents work to exchange between internal money and external money. Paperwork reduces dramatically, as the records of the money system are reliable enough to quickly resolve questions even years after the event."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The innovations present in internal money go beyond the present paper, but suffice to say that they answer the obvious question of why this design of triple entry accounting sprung from the world of digital cash, and has relevence back to the corporate world."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Todd Boyle looked at a similar problem from the point of view of small business needs in an Internet age, and reached the same conclusion \u2013 triple entry accounting[10]. His starting premises were that:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "From those foundations, Boyle concluded that therefore what is needed is a shared access repository that provides arms-length access. Fundamentally, this repository is akin to the classic double-entry accounting ledger of transaction rows (\"GLT\" for General Ledger - Transactions), yet its entries are dynamic and shared."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Simple examples will help. When Alice forms a transaction, she enters it into her software. Every GLT transaction requires naming her external counterparty, Bob. When she posts the transaction, her software stores it in her local GLT and also submits it to the shared repository service's GLT."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The Shared Transaction Repository (\"STR\") then forwards the transaction on to Bob. Both Bob and Alice are now expected to store the handle to the transaction as an index or stub, and the STR then stores the entire transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Boyle's ideas are logically comparable to Grigg and Howland's, although they arive from different directions (the STR is Grigg's Ivan, above) and are not totally equivalent. Where the latter limited themselves to payments, the accuracy of amounts, and protection with hard cryptographic shells, Boyle looked at wider patterns of transactions, and showed that the STR could mediate these transactions, if the core shared data could be extracted and made into a single shared record. Boyle's focus was on the economic substance of the transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Imagine a simple invoicing procedure. Alice creates an invoice and posts it to her software (GLT). As she has named Bob, the GLT automatically posts it to Ivan, the STR, and he forwards it to Bob. At this point Bob has a decision to make, accept or reject. Assuming acceptance, his software can then respond by sending an acceptance message to Ivan. The STR now assembles an accepted invoice record to replace the earlier speculative invoice record and posts that threeways. At some related time (to do with payment policy) Bob also posts a separate transaction to pay for the invoice. This could operate in much the same way as a separate transaction, linking directly to the original invoice."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Now, as the payment links back, and the invoice is a live transaction within the three entries in the three accounting systems, it is possible for a new updated invoice record to refer back to the payment activity. When the payment clears, the new record can again replace the older unpaid copy and promulgate to all three parties."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Software could be written to facilitate and monitor this flow and similar flows. If the payments system is sufficiently flexible, and integrated with the needs of the users, if might be possible to merge the above invoice with the payment itself, at the Receipts level. Seen in this light, the Signed receipt of Ricardo is simply the smallest and simplest pattern within the more general set of patterns. We could then suggest that the narrow principle of the Receipt is the Transaction could be extended into The Invoice is the Transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "A particular transaction in business almost never stands alone. They come in patterns. For example offers and acceptances form a wider transaction but seldom encapsulate the entire fulfillment and payment cycle.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "There is a large body of science and literature built around these patterns of transactions. These have been adopted by the Business Process workgroup of ebXML and other standards bodies, where they are called \"Commercial Transactions.\" Where however the present work distinguishes itself is in breaking down these transactions into the atomic elements. It is to that we now turn."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "The implementation of Triple Entry Accounting will in time evolve to support patterns of transactions. What has become clear is that double entry does not sufficiently support these patterns, as it is a framework that breaks down as soon as the number of parties exceeds one.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Below are the list of requirements that we believed to be important[11][12]."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "1. Strong Psuedonymity, At Least. As there are many cycles in the patterns, the system must support a clear relationship of participants. At the minimum this requires a nymous architecture of the nature of Ricardo or AADS. (This requirement is very clear, but space prevents any discussion of it.)"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "2. Entry Signing. In order to neutralise the threats to and by the parties, a mechanism that freezes and confirms the basic data is needed. This is signing, and we require that all entries are capable of carrying digital signatures (see 1, above, which suggests public key signatures)."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "3. Message Passing. The system is fundamentally one of message passing, in contrast to much of the net's connection based architecture. Boyle recognised early on that a critical component was the generic message passing nature, and Systemics proposed and built this into Ricardo over the period 2001-2004[13]."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "4. Entry Enlargement and Migration. Each new version of a message coming in represents an entry that is either to be updated or added. As each message adds to a prior conversation, the stored entry needs to enlarge and absorb the new information, while preserving the other properties."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "5. Local Entry Storage and Reports. The persistent saving and responsive availability of entries. In practice, this is the classical accounting general ledger, at least in storage terms. It needs to bend somewhat to handle much more flexible entries, and its report capabilities become more key as they conduct instrinsic reconciliation on a demand or live basis."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "6. Integrated Hard Payments. Trade can only be as efficient as the payment. That means that the payment must be at least as efficient as every other part; which in practice means that a payment system should be built-in at the infrastructure level. C.f., Ricardo."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "7. Integrated Application-Level Messaging. As distinct to the messaging at the lower protocol levels (1 above), there is a requirement for Alice and Bob to be able to communicate. That is because the vast majority of the patterns turns around the basic communications of the agents. There is no point in establishing a better payment and invoice mechanism than the means of communication and negotiation. This concept is perhaps best seen in the SWIFT system which is a messaging system, first and foremost, to deliver instructions for payments."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Double Entry bookkeeping provides evidence of intent and origin, leading to strategies for dealing with errors of accident and fraud. The financial cryptography invention of the signed receipt provides the same benefits, and thus challenges the 800 year reign of double entry. Indeed, in evidentiary terms, the signed receipt is more powerful than double entry records due to the technical qualities of its signature."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "There remain some weaknesses in strict comparison with double entry bookkeeping. Firstly, in the Ricardo instantiation of triple entry accounting, the receipts themselves may be lost or removed, and for this reason we stress as a principle that the entry is the transaction. This results in three active agents who are charged with securing the signed entry as their most important record of transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Secondly, the software ramifications of the triple entry system that are less convenient than that offered by double entry bookkeeping. For this reason, we expand the information held in the receipt into a set of double entry books; in this way we have the best of both worlds on each node: the evidentiary power of the signed entries and the convenience and local crosschecking power of the double entry concept."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Both of these imperitives meld signed receipts in with double entry bookkeeping. As we end up with a logical arrangement of three by three entries, we feel the term triple entry bookkeeping is useful to describe the advance on the older form."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "To fully benefit from triple entry bookkeeping, we have to expand accounting systems out to agents and offer them direct capabilities to do transactions. That is, we make the agents stakeholders by giving them internal money[14]. Use of digital cash to do company accounts empowers the use of this concept as a general replacement for accounting using books and departmental budgets, and is an enabler for verifying and auditing the centralised accounts system by way of signed receipts."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/triple-entry-accounting/", "title": "Triple Entry Accounting", "text": "Once there, governance receives substantial benefits. Accounts are now much more difficult to change, and much more transparent. It is our opinion that various scandals and failures of governance would have been impossible given these techniques: the mutual funds scandal would have shown a clear audit trail of transactions and thus late timing and otherwise perverted or dropped transactions would have been clearly identified or eliminated completely[15]. The emerging scandal in the USA known as Stockgate would have been impossible as forgery of shares and value for manipulative trading purposes is revealed by signed receipts. Likewise, Barings would still be a force in investment banking if accounts had been organised around easily transparent digital cash with open and irreducible signed receipts that evidence invisible accounts (88888). Enron style scandals would have permitted more direct \"follow the money\" governance lifting the veil on various innovative but economically meaningless swaps."}

In order to verify the signature on a message, you need to have the corresponding public key. Truledger identifies customers by the hash of their public key, their ID. The ID is a 40-character string of numbers and the letters A to F, the hexadecimal representation of a 160-bit number. You identify your account to the Truledger client with a passphrase, which is used to encrypt your private key on your disk. You'll only need to copy and paste your ID when you want to tell a trading partner how to send you money for the first time, or to seed your account with usage tokens, as Sue did for Bob."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/truledger/", "title": "Truledger in Plain English", "text": "Usage tokens are an idea from Patrick Chkoreff's Loom system. They are a way to charge for the server's resources. You have to buy storage for your account balances, and lease temporary storage for transactions. Usage tokens are the \"currency\" used to do this. Truledger also supports fees in other asset types, for server management that wants to make more than the sale of usage tokens. Truledger uses the file system as a database. One file in the Truledger database costs one usage token. Files vary in size, but are usually about 8K, mostly signatures."}

Every message going to and from Truledger is digitally signed. It's only possible to verify a digital signature if you know the public key of the signer. A new customer's public key isn't in the database until after he's registered, so the first two messages, in which the new customer gets the server's public key, so that he can verify the server's signatures, and the registration request, both need to include the customers's public key, so that the signatures on those two messages can themselves be verified. After registration is complete, subsequent messages need to carry only the ID; the public key can then be looked up in the database."}

Unless the protocol protects against that, this can cause problems. Except for the serverid request, the registration request, and a request for a customer's last request number, every information request must be accompanied by a request number that is larger than the customer's last used request number, and every transaction must be accompanied by a transaction number that is given out by the server. The server maintains a counter, which it increments each time someone asks for a transaction number. This makes requests that reveal information or initiate transactions impossible to replay without a customer's passphrase and private key. In the Truledger world, your passphrase and your private key are your identity. Guard them well."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/truledger/", "title": "Truledger in Plain English", "text": "Another possible replay attack is to intercept a message for one server and send it to another. Customers could protect against this by having different IDs, hence different public/private key pairs, for different servers. But it will be very convenient to use the same ID.

He got 50 usage tokens from Sue, and paid the server 10 usage tokens for his registration fee. The additional usage token is the price of the new file used to store the usage token balance. Storage costs usage tokens. Loom charges 1 usage token for each 16 bytes of storage. I considered charging per byte, but decided that charging per file was easier to handle, though not quite as fair. It only makes sense if message sizes are limited, of course. If you were allowed megabyte messages, then Truledger would have to charge per byte, or per kilobyte."}

You are charged two usage tokens to lease the new outbox and inbox files. When the recipient accepts the spend, his balance for the spent asset is credited, the spend notice is removed from his inbox, and a spend acceptance notice is added to your inbox. When you acknowledge his acceptance of the spend, the spend request is removed from your outbox, the acceptance notice is removed from your inbox, and the two usage tokens you paid to lease those files is credited to your balance.

But the message the customer signs to create the asset, and that the server signs to acknowledge creation, also contains the serverid. This allows the asset to be registered at multiple servers, with the same ID, but makes each particular registration specific to a specific server.

A -1 balance in the issuer's account means there are no outstanding balances or outbox entries in that asset, so that's where Bob's Bob GoldGrams balance begins. Users of an asset have to trust the issuer when he tells them, outside of Truledger, that his asset is backed by something of real value, and that he'll never issue more of the virtual asset than he has in the backing commodity. Well, unless he wants to act like a country, and issue fiat currency that is backed by his Full Faith and Credit and nothing else. Good luck getting people to go for that."}

I know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye.

There needed no licensing of books among them, for they disliked all but their own laconic apophthegms, and took a slight occasion to chase Archilochus out of their city, perhaps for composing in a higher strain than their own soldierly ballads and roundels could reach to.

But Scipio and others of the noblest senators withstood him and his old Sabine austerity; honoured and admired the men; and the censor himself at last, in his old age, fell to the study of that whereof before he was so scrupulous. And yet at the same time Naevius and Plautus, the first Latin comedians, had filled the city with all the borrowed scenes of Menander and Philemon.

Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into the sea? But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before a jury ere it be born to the world, and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and new hells wherein they might include our books also within the number of their damned. And this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains.

And indeed the Christians were put so to their shifts by this crafty means, and so much in danger to decline into all ignorance, that the two Apollinarii were fain, as a man may say, to coin all the seven liberal sciences out of the Bible, reducing it into divers forms of orations, poems, dialogues, even to the calculating of a new Christian grammar. But, saith the historian Socrates, the providence of God provided better than the industry of Apollinarius and his son, by taking away that illiterate law with the life of him who devised it.

The worthy man, loath to give offence, fell into a new debate with himself what was to be thought; when suddenly a vision sent from God (it is his own epistle that so avers it) confirmed him in these words: READ ANY BOOKS WHATEVER COME TO THY HANDS, FOR THOU ART SUFFICIENT BOTH TO JUDGE ARIGHT AND TO EXAMINE EACH MATTER. To this revelation he assented the sooner, as he confesses, because it was answerable to that of the Apostle to the Thessalonians, PROVE ALL THINGS, HOLD FAST THAT WHICH IS GOOD.

Bad meats will scarce breed good nourishment in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference is of bad books, that they to a discreet and judicious reader serve in many respects to discover, to confute, to forewarn, and to illustrate. Whereof what better witness can ye expect I should produce, than one of your own now sitting in Parliament, the chief of learned men reputed in this land, Mr. Selden; whose volume of natural and national laws proves, not only by great authorities brought together, but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main service and assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest. I conceive, therefore, that when God did enlarge the universal diet of man's body, saving ever the rules of temperance, he then also, as before, left arbitrary the dieting and repasting of our minds; as wherein every mature man might have to exercise his own leading capacity."}

And therefore when he himself tabled the Jews from heaven, that omer, which was every man's daily portion of manna, is computed to have been more than might have well sufficed the heartiest feeder thrice as many meals. For those actions which enter into a man, rather than issue out of him, and therefore defile not, God uses not to captivate under a perpetual childhood of prescription, but trusts him with the gift of reason to be his own chooser; there were but little work left for preaching, if law and compulsion should grow so fast upon those things which heretofore were governed only by exhortation. Solomon informs us, that much reading is a weariness to the flesh; but neither he nor other inspired author tells us that such or such reading is unlawful: yet certainly had God thought good to limit us herein, it had been much more expedient to have told us what was unlawful than what was wearisome. As for the burning of those Ephesian books by St. Paul's converts; 'tis replied the books were magic, the Syriac so renders them. It was a private act, a voluntary act, and leaves us to a voluntary imitation: the men in remorse burnt those books which were their own; the magistrate by this example is not appointed; these men practised the books, another might perhaps have read them in some sort usefully."}

It was from out the rind of one apple tasted, that the knowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil, that is to say of knowing good by evil. As therefore the state of man now is; what wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil?

That virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evil, and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers, and rejects it, is but a blank virtue, not a pure; her whiteness is but an excremental whiteness. Which was the reason why our sage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas, describing true temperance under the person of Guion, brings him in with his palmer through the cave of Mammon, and the bower of earthly bliss, that he might see and know, and yet abstain. Since therefore the knowledge and survey of vice is in this world so necessary to the constituting of human virtue, and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth, how can we more safely, and with less danger, scout into the regions of sin and falsity than by reading all manner of tractates and hearing all manner of reason?

And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal Keri, that Moses and all the prophets cannot persuade him to pronounce the textual Chetiv. For these causes we all know the Bible itself put by the Papist must be next removed, as Clement of Alexandria, and that Eusebian book of Evangelic preparation, transmitting our ears through a hoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the Gospel.

For if there should be so much exactness always used to keep that from him which is unfit for his reading, we should in the judgment of Aristotle not only, but of Solomon and of our Saviour, not vouchsafe him good precepts, and by consequence not willingly admit him to good books; as being certain that a wise man will make better use of an idle pamphlet, than a fool will do of sacred Scripture."}

By which laws he seems to tolerate no kind of learning but by unalterable decree, consisting most of practical traditions, to the attainment whereof a library of smaller bulk than his own Dialogues would be abundant. And there also enacts, that no poet should so much as read to any private man what he had written, until the judges and law-keepers had seen it, and allowed it. But that Plato meant this law peculiarly to that commonwealth which he had imagined, and to no other, is evident. Why was he not else a lawgiver to himself, but a transgressor, and to be expelled by his own magistrates; both for the wanton epigrams and dialogues which he made, and his perpetual reading of Sophron Mimus and Aristophanes, books of grossest infamy, and also for commending the latter of them, though he were the malicious libeller of his chief friends, to be read by the tyrant Dionysius, who had little need of such trash to spend his time on? But that he knew this licensing of poems had reference and dependence to many other provisos there set down in his fancied republic, which in this world could have no place: and so neither he himself, nor any magistrate or city, ever imitated that course, which, taken apart from those other collateral injunctions, must needs be vain and fruitless.

If then the Order shall not be vain and frustrate, behold a new labour, Lords and Commons, ye must repeal and proscribe all scandalous and unlicensed books already printed and divulged; after ye have drawn them up into a list, that all may know which are condemned, and which not; and ordain that no foreign books be delivered out of custody, till they have been read over. This office will require the whole time of not a few overseers, and those no vulgar men. There be also books which are partly useful and excellent, partly culpable and pernicious; this work will ask as many more officials, to make expurgations and expunctions, that the commonwealth of learning be not damnified. In fine, when the multitude of books increase upon their hands, ye must be fain to catalogue all those printers who are found frequently offending, and forbid the importation of their whole suspected typography. In a word, that this your Order may be exact and not deficient, ye must reform it perfectly according to the model of Trent and Seville, which I know ye abhor to do."}

It cannot be denied but that he who is made judge to sit upon the birth or death of books, whether they may be wafted into this world or not, had need to be a man above the common measure, both studious, learned, and judicious; there may be else no mean mistakes in the censure of what is passable or not; which is also no mean injury. If he be of such worth as behooves him, there cannot be a more tedious and unpleasing journey-work, a greater loss of time levied upon his head, than to be made the perpetual reader of unchosen books and pamphlets, ofttimes huge volumes. There is no book that is acceptable unless at certain seasons; but to be enjoined the reading of that at all times, and in a hand scarce legible, whereof three pages would not down at any time in the fairest print, is an imposition which I cannot believe how he that values time and his own studies, or is but of a sensible nostril, should be able to endure. In this one thing I crave leave of the present licensers to be pardoned for so thinking; who doubtless took this office up, looking on it through their obedience to the Parliament, whose command perhaps made all things seem easy and unlaborious to them; but that this short trial hath wearied them out already, their own expressions and excuses to them who make so many journeys to solicit their licence are testimony enough. Seeing therefore those who now possess the employment by all evident signs wish themselves well rid of it; and that no man of worth, none that is not a plain unthrift of his own hours, is ever likely to succeed them, except he mean to put himself to the salary of a press corrector; we may easily foresee what kind of licensers we are to expect hereafter, either ignorant, imperious, and remiss, or basely pecuniary. This is what I had to show, wherein this Order cannot conduce to that end whereof it bears the intention."}

There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought. And though I knew that England then was groaning loudest under the prelatical yoke, nevertheless I took it as a pledge of future happiness, that other nations were so persuaded of her liberty. Yet was it beyond my hope that those worthies were then breathing in her air, who should be her leaders to such a deliverance, as shall never be forgotten by any revolution of time that this world hath to finish. When that was once begun, it was as little in my fear that what words of complaint I heard among learned men of other parts uttered against the Inquisition, the same I should hear by as learned men at home, uttered in time of Parliament against an order of licensing; and that so generally that, when I had disclosed myself a companion of their discontent, I might say, if without envy, that he whom an honest quaestorship had endeared to the Sicilians was not more by them importuned against Verres, than the favourable opinion which I had among many who honour ye, and are known and respected by ye, loaded me with entreaties and persuasions, that I would not despair to lay together that which just reason should bring into my mind, toward the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon learning.

To be still searching what we know not by what we know, still closing up truth to truth as we find it (for all her body is homogeneal and proportional), this is the golden rule in theology as well as in arithmetic, and makes up the best harmony in a Church; not the forced and outward union of cold, and neutral, and inwardly divided minds."}

Therefore the studies of learning in her deepest sciences have been so ancient and so eminent among us, that writers of good antiquity and ablest judgment have been persuaded that even the school of Pythagoras and the Persian wisdom took beginning from the old philosophy of this island. And that wise and civil Roman, Julius Agricola, who governed once here for Caesar, preferred the natural wits of Britain before the laboured studies of the French. Nor is it for nothing that the grave and frugal Transylvanian sends out yearly from as far as the mountainous borders of Russia, and beyond the Hercynian wilderness, not their youth, but their staid men, to learn our language and our theologic arts."}

And had it not been the obstinate perverseness of our prelates against the divine and admirable spirit of Wickliff, to suppress him as a schismatic and innovator, perhaps neither the Bohemian Huns and Jerome, no nor the name of Luther or of Calvin, had been ever known: the glory of reforming all our neighbours had been completely ours. But now, as our obdurate clergy have with violence demeaned the matter, we are become hitherto the latest and the backwardest scholars, of whom God offered to have made us the teachers. Now once again by all concurrence of signs, and by the general instinct of holy and devout men, as they daily and solemnly express their thoughts, God is decreeing to begin some new and great period in his Church, even to the reforming of Reformation itself: what does he then but reveal himself to his servants, and as his manner is, first to his Englishmen? I say, as his manner is, first to us, though we mark not the method of his counsels, and are unworthy."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "A long time ago I hit upon the idea of bit gold. The problem, in a nutshell, is that our money currently depends on trust in a third party for its value. As many inflationary and hyperinflationary episodes during the 20th century demonstrated, this is not an ideal state of affairs. Similarly, private bank note issue, while it had various advantages as well as disadvantages, similarly depended on a trusted third party."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "Precious metals and collectibles have an unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. This once provided money the value of which was largely independent of any trusted third party. Precious metals have problems, however. It's too costly to assay metals repeatedly for common transactions. Thus a trusted third party (usually associated with a tax collector who accepted the coins as payment) was invoked to stamp a standard amount of the metal into a coin. Transporting large values of metal can be a rather insecure affair, as the British found when transporting gold across a U-boat infested Atlantic to Canada during World War I to support their gold standard. What's worse, you can't pay online with metal."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "Thus, it would be very nice if there were a protocol whereby unforgeably costly bits could be created online with minimal dependence on trusted third parties, and then securely stored, transferred, and assayed with similar minimal trust. Bit gold."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "My proposal for bit gold is based on computing a string of bits from a string of challenge bits, using functions called variously \"client puzzle function,\" \"proof of work function,\" or \"secure benchmark function.\" The resulting string of bits is the proof of work. Where a one-way function is prohibitively difficult to compute backwards, a secure benchmark function ideally comes with a specific cost, measured in compute cycles, to compute backwards."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "All of this can be automated by software. The main limits to the security of the scheme are how well trust can be distributed in steps (3) and (4), and the problem of machine architecture which will be discussed below."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "Hal Finney has implemented a variant of bit gold called RPOW (Reusable Proofs of Work). This relies on publishing the computer code for the \"mint,\" which runs on a remote tamper-evident computer. The purchaser of of bit gold can then use remote attestation, which Finney calls the transparent server technique, to verify that a particular number of cycles were actually performed."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "The main problem with all these schemes is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" (I wrote about this obscurely several years ago.) Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold. However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector's items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect \"bit gold\" acts more like collector's items than like gold. However, the match between this ex post market and the auction determining the initial value might create a very substantial profit for the \"bit gold miner\" who invents and deploys an optimized computer architecture."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "Thus, bit gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/", "title": "Bit Gold", "text": "In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another. This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation. Bit gold may provide us with a money of unprecedented security from these dangers. The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address."}

This means that thhe least significant bit (LSB) of an audio DAT recordingng carries about 8megabytes of data! So Alice is stopped by the Data Police. They ask if she's carrying illegal data.

When Bob and Charlie compare notes after she double-spends, every value of i for which they chose different 0's and 1's, which will be on the average half of them, will reveal an <info> field.

Bob would push the \"check money\" button when Alice spent it and it would flash red or green.

It was a front-end for SCCS, RCS and later CVS from within Emacs that offered \"one-touch\" version control operations. It evolved from a tiny, crude sccs.el mode somebody else had written.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/", "title": "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", "text": "It seemed to me that trying to make that imperative minilanguage more like English might make it easier to use. Now, although I'm a convinced partisan of the \"make it a language\" school of design as exemplified by Emacs and HTML and many database engines, I am not normally a big fan of \"English-like\" syntaxes."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/", "title": "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", "text": "Traditionally programmers have tended to favor control syntaxes that are very precise and compact and have no redundancy at all.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/", "title": "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", "text": "There remain, however, good reasons to be wary. One is the complexity cost of the parsing stage\u2014you don't want to raise that to the point where it's a significant source of bugs and user confusion in itself. Another is that trying to make a language syntax English-like often demands that the \"English\" it speaks be bent seriously out of shape, so much so that the superficial resemblance to natural language is as confusing as a traditional syntax would have been.

The developer who uses only his or her own brain in a closed project is going to fall behind the developer who knows how to create an open, evolutionary context in which feedback exploring the design space, code contributions, bug-spotting, and other improvements come from from hundreds (perhaps thousands) of people."}

Each relies on the same techniques for encoding denominations in signatures and for \"devaluing\" signatures to the exact amount chosen at the time of payment. They differ in how the unspent value is returned to the payer. In the first, all change is accumulated by the payer in a single \"cookie jar,\" which might be deposited at the bank during the next withdrawal transaction. The second and third schemes allow change to be distributed among unspent notes, which can themselves later be spent. The second scheme reveals to the shop and bank the maximum amount for which a note can be spent; the third does not disclose this information."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "For simplicity and concreteness, but without loss of generality, a particular denomination scheme will be used here. It assigns the value of 1 cent to public exponent 3 in an RSA system, the value of 2 cents to exponent 5, 4 cents to exponent 7, and so on; each successive power-of-two value is represented by the corresponding odd prime public exponent, all with the same modulus. Much as in [C89], a third root of an image under the one-way function f (together with the pre-image modulo the bank's RSA composite) is worth 1 cent, a 7th root is worth 4 cents, and a 21st root 5 cents. In other words, a distinct public prime exponent is associated with each digit of the binary integer representation of an amount of payment; for a particular amount of payment, the product of all those prime exponents corresponding to 1 's in the binary representation of the amount is the public exponent of the signature."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "A signature on an image under f is \"devalued\" by raising it to the public powers corresponding to the coin values that should be removed.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "In earlier online payment systems[C89], the number of separate signatures needed for a payment was in general the Hamming weight of the binary representation of the amount. Since online systems would be used for higher-value payments (as mentioned above), and extra resolution may be desired to provide interest for unspent funds[C89], an average of roughly an order of magnitude is saved here."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "In this first scheme the payer periodically withdraws a supply of notes from the bank, each with the system-wide maximum value. Consider an example, shown in Figure 1.1, in which two notes are withdrawn. The n and ri are random. The ri \"blind\" (from the bank) the images under the public, one-way function f. The bank's signature corresponds to taking the h-th root, where h = 3*5*7*11. As in all the figures, the payer sends messages from the left and the bank sends from the right."}

The third residue is a blinded \"cookie jar,\" a blinded image under f of a randomly chosen value j. This cookie jar is modulo a second RSA composite that is only used for cookie jars. Once the bank verifies the funds received, and that n1 has not been spent previously, it signs and returns the blinded cookie jar (under the cookie jar modulus) with public exponents corresponding to the change due."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "The second payment, shown in figure 1.3, is essentially the same as the first, except that the amount is 3 cents and the cookie jar now has some roots already on it.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "The cookie jar approach gives the effect of an online form of \"offline checks\"[C89], in that notes of a fixed value are withdrawn and the unspent parts later credited to the payer during a refund transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "Figure 2 depicts a somewhat different scheme, which allows change to be spent without an intervening withdrawal transaction. Withdrawals can be just as in the cookie-jar scheme, but here a single modulus is used for everything in the system. The products of public exponents representing the various amounts are as follows: d is the amount paid, g is the note value, the \"change\" c is g/d, and h is again the maximal amount, where d | g | h. A payment (still to the bank through a shop) includes first and second components that are the same as in the cookie-jar scheme. The third component is the amount of change c the payer claims should be returned. The fourth is a (blinded) number m, which could be an image under f used in a later payment just as n is used in this one."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "The signature returned contains a \"protection\" factor (shown inside the padlock). This factor ensures that the payer actually has the c-th root of f(n), by requiring that the payer apply f to it before dividing the result out of the signature. Without such protection, a payer could get the systemwide maximum change, regardless of how much change is actually due; with it, the change claimed can only be recovered if the corresponding roots on n are in fact known to the payer."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "The change returned in a payment can be divided into parts that fill in missing denominations in notes not yet spent.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "Because overpayment allows change to be returned in any chosen denominations (not shown), the payer has extra flexibility and is able to use all funds held.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "Although the combination of the previous two subsections is quite workable, it may be desirable for the payer not to have to reveal c to the shop or the bank. Figure 4 shows a system allowing this. The payment message is just as in the declared note value protocol above, except that c is not sent. The protection factor (shown again in a lock) is also placed under the signature, but it is missing the extra f and is raised to a random power z chosen by the bank"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/online-cash-checks/", "title": "Online Cash Checks", "text": "If z were known to the payer before payment, then the payer could cheat by including f(n) in the third component; this would yield the payer the system-wide maximum change, even if none were due. Consider a single change exponent q. If z mod q is guessed correctly by a cheating payer, then the payer improperly gets the corresponding coin value. Thus the chance of successful cheating is 1/q.

The government tried to encourage private industry to design it into all their secure communication products, such as secure phones, secure faxes, and so on.

Consider monkeys exchanging favors \u2013 say pieces of fruit for back scratches. Mutual grooming can remove ticks and fleas that an individual can't see or reach. But just how much grooming versus how many pieces of fruit constitutes a reciprocation that both sides will consider to be \"fair\", or in other words not a defection? Is twenty minutes of back-scratching worth one piece of fruit or two? And how big a piece? And just how long is twenty minutes anyway? In some cases this is relatively easy to solve, as with the delayed barter of blood for blood in vampire bats. These bats can come home from a hunting mission either overstuffed or starving. Overstuffed bats can regurgitate blood to feed hungry ones. The grateful recipient can remember the favor an return it in a future hunting trip when the tables might be turned.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Adams[1] uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives \u2013 both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments \u2013 to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors. Democratic governments may maintain high tax revenues over historical time by more peaceful means than conquering underfunded states. They are the first states in history with tax revenues so high relative to external threats that they have the luxury of spending most of the money in non-military areas. Their tax regimes have operated closer to the Laffer optimum than those of most previous kinds of governments. (Alternatively, this luxury may be made possible by the efficiency of nuclear weapons in deterring attack rather than the increased incentives of democracies to optimize to tax collection)."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "When we apply the Laffer curve to examining the relative impact of tax rules on various industries, we conclude that the desire to optimize tax revenues causes tax collectors to want to accurately measure the income or wealth being taxed. Measuring value is crucial to determining the taxpayer's incentives to avoid or evade the tax or opt out of the taxed activity. For their part, taxpayers can and do spoof these measurements in various ways. Most tax shelter schemes, for example, are based on the taxpayer minimizing reported value while optimizing actual, private value. Tax collection involves a measurement game with unaligned incentives, similar to but even more severe than measurement games between owner and employee, investor and management, store and shopper, and plaintiff-defendant (or judge-guilty party)."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "As with accounting rules, legal damage rules, or contractual terms, the choice of tax rules involves trading off complexity (or, more generally, the costs of measurement) for more accurate measures of value. And worst of all, as with the other rule-making problems, rule choices ultimately ground out on subjective measures of value. Thus a vast number of cases are left where the tax code is unfair or can be avoided. Since tax collectors are not mind readers, tax rules and judgments must substitute for actual subjective values its judgments of what the \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201caverage\u201d person's preferences would be in the situation.

However, the value measurement problem is hardly unique to tax collection. It is endemic when assessing damages in contract and tort law, and when devising fines punishments in administrative and criminal law. Many private sector rules found in contracts, accounting, and other institutions also have the quality that they use highly non-obvious measures of value that turn out, upon close examination, to be brilliant solutions to seemingly intractable problems of mind-reading and the unacceptable complexity of covering all cases or contingencies. Such measurement problems occur in every kind of economic system or relationship. The best solutions civilization has developed to solve them are in most institutions brilliant but highly imperfect. There is vast room for improvement, but failed large-scale experiments in attempts to improve these measures can be devastating."}

Prior to the industrial revolution, for example, the income tax was infeasible. Most taxes were on the prices of commodities sold, or on various ad-hoc measures of wealth such as the frontage of one's house. (This measurement game resulted in the very tall and deep but narrow houses that can still be found in some European cities such as Amsterdam.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Prior to the industrial revolution, incomes were often a very private matter. However, starting in England in the early nineteenth century, large firms grew to an increasing proportion of the economy. Broadly speaking, large firms and joint-stock companies were made possible by two phases of accounting advances. The first phase, double-entry bookkeeping, was developed for the trading banks and \"super companies\" of early fourteenth century Italy. The second phase were accounting and reporting techniques developed for the larger joint stock companies of the Netherlands and England, starting with the India companies in the seventeenth century. Accounting allowed manager-owners to keep track of employees and (in the second phase) for non-management owners to keep track of managers. These accounting techniques, along with the rise of literacy and numeracy among the workers, provided a new way for tax collectors to measure value. Once these larger companies came to handle a sufficient fraction of an jurisdiction's value of transactions, it was rational for governments to take advantage of their measurement techniques, and they did so \u2013 the result being the most lucrative tax scheme ever, the income tax."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "While the incentives between investors and managers of public companies are not as badly misaligned as that between tax collector and taxpayer, the incentives to play games with measurements are still quite substantial.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Intangible assets \u2013 in the form of trade secrets, intellectual property, brands, human resources, and so on \u2013 have become more valuable than tangible assets to many of today's businesses. In business in general, and accounting in particular, it is common to use cost as a proxy measure for value. Indeed, while the actual economic value of an asset is the discounted value of expected future cash flows, most assets are assigned a value based on their costs rather than their expected future cash flow stream."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "This usually works because (a) costs are usually based on verifiable events which can be signed off on and audited, whereas predictions of cash flow are mere speculations about the future, (b) under most conditions we expect that managers have acted rationally, expending money only where they expect, on average, an eventual greater return, and (c) skilled readers of financial statements have learned from experience what games can be played by managers (because their incentives differ from other stakeholders), and to detect signs that managers have acted irrationally (e.g. over or under investment in particular assets)."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Thus, accounting numbers for tangible assets have never been take too literally or in isolation by skilled readers of financial statements. Indeed, the seeming concreteness of tangibles can be quite misleading. A skilled reader knows that most accounting numbers represent costs not value, and apply their knowledge of the industry to determine for themselves how well value may actually be estimated by these costs. For example, a naive reader will take current assets at face value, whereas a skilled reader will look for conditions such as abnormal growth of inventory or receivables. The actual function of a financial statement is to provide clues for analysts based on well-verified facts, not to provide pat final answers for those seeking to evaluate a company."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Some objections to including intangibles on the balance sheet are invalid. For example, it is argued that internally generated intangibles cannot be valued because they have not been purchased on the market. However, this is also often the case for unique industrial investments and inventories. We have developed methods such as specific identification to value internally generated assets, and these could be applied to internally generated intangibles as well. Allocation of costs common to several intangible assets (e.g. a software library used in two different software products) can be based on long experience allocating costs common to multiple tangible assets."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Another more valid objection is that the actual value, in expected cash flow, of intangibles is far more uncertain than for most physical assets. Thus, the mapping from cost to value is far more uncertain. This mapping can be done with greater certainty only over an aggregate of diverse investments. However, there are certain kinds of physical assets whose value is also highly uncertain, yet are assigned a value based on costs. Rational managers discounted their original investments to take into account such risks. The same is true for intangible assets. Skilled readers of financial statements know when to expect high uncertainty. Often they will demand further details from management about the specific investments. Providing greater detail where intangibles are involved is highly advisable, a point I return to below."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "On the other hand, many proposed measures of intangible value are non-starters for the purposes of accounting or financial statements. For example, various measures have been put forth allegedly related to expected cash flows (e.g. measuring web site hits, customer retention rates, etc. to try to estimate the value of a brand). The only time expected value rather than cost is used on a balance sheet for tangibles is when the asset can be currently priced on an efficient, competitive, and public market. (For example, inventories of publically traded commodities can be valued in this manner). Otherwise, it is far better to use cost, the actual event of expenditure, and let the skilled readers of the financial statement interpret these numbers properly."}

Copyrights are very well defined but in some cases very difficult for the company or the state to actually control. Patents can be very ill defined, so that the occurrence of a loss of rights over the actual technology is unclear. However, presumably managers discount their original investments to take into account such risks. Thus, if costs can be allocated to particular patents and copyrights, they constitute a proxy measure for the value of patented and copyrighted assets. This is quite similar to using the cost of a physical asset, whose eventual cash flow value is highly uncertain, to value that asset, and allowing the skilled reader to interpret the resulting number properly."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "A company owns legal rights to its trademark in all developed and most undeveloped economies. Companies further have some control over perception in people's minds, insofar as their observable actions influence this perception. Some major brands names have shown a very persistent value, while lesser ones are more likely to be forgotten. One can map current accounting treatments for investment in, maintenance of, and depreciation of physical assets to investment in and maintance of a brand, as well as the tendency of customers to forget over time a brand that is not maintained."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Employees are not owned, but the labor market is not perfectly fungible. There is some stickiness to it. Indeed, this stickiness can be measured by the turnover rate for the company. The turnover rate, a quite auditable number, may provide an excellent way to depreciate an asset defined by the costs of hiring and training."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "Until long experience is gained by stakeholders with particular kinds of intangible investments, the ability to judge whether costs are rational, and satisfy the interests of stakeholders besides management, will be poor. A wide variety of reporting experiments, most of which will fail, are nevertheless essential to achieving more accurate reporting of asset values to stakeholders. Interpretation of intangible-heavy financial statements is a job for skilled analysts, not casual readers. For the expert more information is better \u2013 the detailed records of expenditures and their allocation to intangible assets are more important to the skilled stakeholder than the summary totals. Such detailed records should be released to stakeholders despite objections about confidentiality. Only long experience with these details will teach stakeholders whether and how to judge summary totals involving intangibles."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/", "title": "Measuring Value", "text": "The measurement of value is one of the most intractable problems of civilization. Brilliant and highly non-obvious solutions to this problem \u2013 from markets to money to the time-wage to cost accounting \u2013 have constituted some of the most important steps from animal to civilization. Historically, the solutions to one value measurement problem (e.g., accounting for value in a large firm) made possible other institutions as well (e.g. income tax, which must first solve the same kind of problem in order to be Laffer competitive with other kinds of taxation). Intangible asset accounting may now be the most important value measurement problem we face as we move beyond the era where tangible industrial commodities dominated the economy."}

The user cannot meaningfully interpret this string of apparently random information, so the software (and thus, the software engineer) is more or less forced to maintain a database that describes what the message digest represents. As the contract is readable by software, it makes a superior source of data than any other (such as an intermediate database that holds the contents) and thus we can reasonably assume, to the extent that the software can, that the user has the full contract available[48]."}

Since these ancients lacked good locks, clay sealings were wrapped around door latches to seal rooms. The security provided \u2013 evidence of tampering, due to damage of the container itself or the clay that sealed it."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-playdough-protocols/", "title": "The Playdough Protocols", "text": "The seal design was usually recessed, resulting in a raised impression; occasionally this was reversed. To creating a sealing, first wet clay was shaped around the plug of a jar, the rim of a basket, the knot of a well wrapped rope on a bale, or the latch of a door. Then the surface of the clay was thoroughly covered by the impressions of the seal. The Sumerians commonly used cylinder seals, repeating the pattern across the entire clay surface. Sometimes stamp seals were used for smaller surfaces. Finally, the clay was left to dry, in the sun if possible."}

Rejoining the breached container lid, knot, or latch and replacing the broken seal with a new, identical seal would have been, short of stealing the original unique seal carving, impossible to hide from the inspector. Looking for a particular seal impression and examining the container, the inspector could reliably tell whether the contents had been tampered with. The difference between an accidental crack, from dropping or hitting the object, and a breach that allowed the thief or adulterator access to the goods, would also be apparent. Ancient inspectors undoubtedly became experts at looking for clues to distinguish accident from fraud. In any case, a broken seal then as now indicated suspect goods suitable perhaps for the discount bin, but more normally for the trash. It also indicated error for fraud \u2013 and potential punishment."}

Indeed, it was probably some version of the latter tongue that was spoken by their neighbors, the early inhabitants of the Indus river valley. These Indus valley people developed, soon after the Sumerians, their own civilization and unique style of seals. Modern speakers of Dravidian languages are scattered all over the Indian subcontinent, including remnants in Afghanistan and a large number of Tamils in southern India. Seal impressions have been found in the ancient city of Harrapan, in the Indus River valley (modern Pakistan), that had been made by seals found in Lagash in Sumeria (modern Iraq).

The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. The procedure for a warehouse receipt was similar. An owner of wheat or barley could consign his fresh harvest to the protection of a warrior-priest in his walled fortress. The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse.

On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 For example on the front woudl be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted gain, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them. The scribe, or an auditor, would then verify that the sum was correct. If not, an error or fraud had occured. Note the similarity to tamper evident seals \u2013 if a seal is broken, this meant that error or fraud had occured. The breaker of the seals, or the scribe who recorded the wrong numbers, or the debtor who paid the wrong amounts of commodities would be called on the carpet to answer for his or her discrepancy."}

They carry cash, checks, and other valuables in tamper-evident clear plastic envelopes. Evidence of tampering comes either as a tear in the plastic, or from opening the bag normally. In the latter case, a seal (the same place you'd find the zip seal on a Zip-Loc bag) chemically alters, and words such as \u201cVOID\u201d or \u201cOPENED\u201d appear in large letters. When these bags carry unique serial numbers, inspectors at both ends can record the serial number while examining the bag for tampering. The unique serial number prevents the tamperer from simply transferring the contents from one such bag to another. Modern plastic bags with the altering chemical seal, used in conjunction with the tracking of unique serial numbers, provide a very strong kind of tamper evidence, and are used by high security institutions ranging from banks to the military to cryptographic certificate authorities. The evidence bags used by many police departments work the same way."}

The way accountants normally use checksums, the fraudster can sometimes with some ingenuity guess what the input numbers are.

A further problem with local nyms is that our relationships are often not neatly compartmentalizable into standard service types, and even where they are we might like to expand them into new areas. I suggest that, at minimum, we will want to reveal progressively more local nyms to our counterparties as our relationships with them become closer and more co-exposed."}

For example, the preference-tracking service at www.firefly.com increases participation via the use of pseudonyms, and suffers little exposure from hostiles. On the other hand, credit transactions typically demand identifying information, because the contractual exposure typically outweighs benefits of privity."}

There is an important conundrum in an ID-based key system: the conflict between the ability to get a new key when the old one is or could be abused by another (key revocation), and the ability of another to be sure they are dealing with the same person again. This may also provide an opportunity for parties to selectively reveal positive credentials and hide negative ones. For example, a person with a bad credit rating could revoke the key under which that rating is distributed and create a new one, while selectively updating their positive credentials to the new key (eg, have their alma mater create a new diploma). Key revocation authorities might combine forces with credit rating agencies to avoid such erasure of negative history, but this gives them even more centralized control \u2014 not merely over IDs but over important elements of reputation associated with those IDs. This further violates the principles of separation of powers and segregation of duties, providing added opportunity for fraudulent issue or revocation of IDs along with fraudulent communication of reputation information."}

As long as the SSN is a shared database key, not used for the purpose of securely identifying a faceless transaction, there is little need for revocation beyond the undesired erasure of negative history. Combining a secret authentication key, which must be revocable, with a public universal ID is quite problematic."}

PAUs correspond to what Alice can express of her personal utility. The MT determines Alice's static and and temporal preferences from the budget Alice already maintains (for example, her small business budget in Quicken). Additional preference specification forms may be provided beyond those of a normal budgeting program. For example, Alice\u2019s software preference settings, her behavior with keyboard and mouse, and similar clues might be usefully interpreted as economic preferences, for example with regard to where to allocate scarce screen real estate and network bandwidth."}

In the mode pictured above, Alice and Bob negotiate back and forth. The negotation of the source contract terms will usually be manual. The \"source language\" will typically be a human readable GUI, while the \"target\" will be a standard formal contract language. If Alice and Bob can input preferences leading to automated negotiations, then a \"shopping bot\" and \"catalog bot\" respectively may be used. This is a layer above and beyond the scope of the MT. The MT is only a \"shopping bot\" in the restricted but important area of contracts composed of atomic bearer contracts \u2013 rights to scarce objects \u2013 to the extent that the price relationships between these bearer contracts are available from quoted markets."}

Her MT translates this into a series of payments and hedges: a sophisticated synthetic contract as obscure to Alice and Bob as binary code is to many programmers these days. This synthetic is constructed out of liquid market securities (bearer contracts) and derivatives of low transaction cost. A synthetic contract is naturally represented as a composite object, a part-whole hierarchy composing primitive contractual \"atoms\", such as securities and derivatives."}

This tree has two kinds of nodes, \"chance\" nodes which iterate through all material possibilities, and \"choice\" nodes where the optimal choice is made. The result is the expected value of a set of contractual terms. The trees can represent a large number of contracts with low resolution (lots of pruning and heuristics), or a simple contract with high resolution (all possibilities considered). Desktop computers are or will soon be fast enough to search through thousands of contingencies, and synthetic contracts composed of hundreds of atomic contracts, with delays less than Internet latencies. So the binary contract can be a very sophisticated synthetic, as long as its analysis is fully automated, and still conserve mental transaction costs."}

Essentially, \u2018\u2026and then you go to jail\u2019 is the penultimate error-handling step in a book entry transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "In the old days, before telegraphy, most financial transactions were done by trading bearer certificates, or tokens, of one form or another.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The solution was to move all the certificates to a central trusted location, called a clearinghouse, and for the trading parties to swap debits and credits between themselves and the clearinghouse.

All except for one thing. If someone lies or reneges on a book entry transaction, there isn\u2019t much that the other two parties can do except bar them from trading, which, of course, works in bearer certificates, but not nearly as well in book-entry settlement."}

First, we need the ability to determine who physically made what book-entry so we can find them and send them to jail for fraud if necessary. That\u2019s because book entries are inherently unstable, insecure, digits sitting in a database somewhere. Many people in Asia are familiar with commodities and derivatives traders who were capable of hiding fraudulent book-entries for long enough periods of time to bring down their respective firms, for instance. In cryptography we call this an authentication problem."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "So, besides authentication of the book-entries themselves, we need to secure the links between various charts of database accounts, first by authenticating the users of those electronic links, originally with passwords, then with cryptographic keys and signatures, and now with some combination of biometrics (finger or retinal prints, say) and digital signatures. And, second, by actually encrypting the links themselves so that no one can see what they are even if they can\u2019t change the authenticated data without someone noticing."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "So, let\u2019s get started with a look at the players in this market."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "A consumer is someone who buys a piece of digital cash from a financial intermediary, an underwriter, in exchange for some other kind of money, a change in a bank account balance in this case, in order to effect a transaction on the net."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "A merchant is someone who accepts a digital bearer certificate in payment for something else."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Of course, I hate the use of the words consumer and merchant because they don\u2019t describe geodesic peer-to-peer transactions very well, but the banking world understands them perfectly, like they do underwriter or trustee or custodian, so I use them here."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The underwriter issues digital bearer certificates, and is fiduciarily responsible for exchanging them into other forms of money, again a bank account balance change, held by a custodian in a reserve account. Someday, of course, the reserve assets collateralising an issue of digital cash could be some other digital bearer asset."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The second most important thing an underwriter does is to verify, at every transaction, that a given digital bearer cash certificate hasn\u2019t been double spent, copied by someone and spent twice. After that, the underwriter issues a brand new signature- blinded certificate to the person accepting the cash in payment. If the exchange fails at any point, so does the transaction, and the person offering the cash is prevented from double spending it, thus preventing repudiation of the transaction at execution time. Cheques, credit cards, or any book-entry transaction can\u2019t offer that security. Even with on-line validation for fraud, the merchant is still at risk of stopped checks or chargebacks."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Finally, the most important thing an underwriter does is to market its certificates to the world. Which, if you look at an underwriter in the capital markets, is exactly what they do for both primary and secondary transactions, and that\u2019s why I use the label here."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The original DigiCash ecash mint at Mark Twain Bank was a used 486 machine, just to give you an example of the hardware cost of being an under- writer. Eventually underwriting may be automated to the point of processor husbandry in the same way that one tends a web or router farm today, but it should always be done by a separate financial entity other than the trustee."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "A trustee, or custodian, holds the money reserving an issue of digital cash, on behalf of the cash certificate holders, in a bank account, though someday the reserve assets could be held in bearer form under the trustee\u2019s control. Like bond trustees or mutual fund custodians, the trustee operates according to an agreement, like a bond debenture, between the underwriter and the certificate holders. This agreement could specify fees and, most important in the early adoption process, reserve ratios."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "So, while the underwriter is the direct financial intermediary, and keeps the interest which accrues on the reserve account, the trustee risks their reputation by holding the reserves, is compensated for it, and controls that risk by making sure that the reserve agreement is adhered to."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Put simply, there is no way to to get exchangeability of digital bearer securities into book-entry assets without a genuine, fully regulated trustee/custodial bank, which, in my opinion, is why we don\u2019t have internet digital bearer settlement today."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The holders of the blind signature patent, and other protocol inventors, have a hard time understanding this. DigiCash, as the canonical example, will only license their patent to a single bank in a single country, and not to any one else, forcing the trustee and underwriter to be the same entity, creating a very brittle and not very robust network of financial entities. The result has been market failure, for the most part. Having a competitive, many-to-many, underwriter/trustee market system fixes that problem completely, as we\u2019ll see in a bit."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "For all intents and purposes, the consumer, merchant, underwriter and trustee are really all the financial entities necessary in a market for a digital bearer instrument."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "There are other entities required to make this work, of course. There are developers of the software for that market and, most important, the inventors of the financial cryptography protocols, like David Chaum, Mark Manasse, Stephan Brands, Ron Rivest or Ian Goldberg."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Developers can either sell their software directly to customers or merchants, or they can sell servers to the underwriters and the underwriters can give away clients to their users."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Inventors can license their protocol to the market as a whole through the trustee. This way, trustees can take royalties out of a percentage of the underwriters\u2019 interest earnings on the reserve account, or from the fees charged when some other asset is converted into the bearer instrument in question, or some combination of both."}

You don\u2019t even need patents to do it. Even with bearer-collateralised trustees, the inventor of the protocol still gets paid, no matter who or where he is. This, among other things, is part of the judge role I was talking about above. The trustee, who\u2019s in business to be fair and impartial, loses reputation capital otherwise."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The consumer buys, from a software developer, or is given, by an underwriter, a wallet: a client application which allows the storage and disbursement of digital bearer certificates. Wallets will probably be specific to the cash-protocol used, and not to the underwriter using the protocol."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "With a wallet installed, maybe as a browser plug-in, the consumer goes to the underwriter\u2019s secure web page. The consumer enters, either by swiping a card or emitting stored information on her hard drive, the account and PIN number for her bank account just like she would at an ATM. The consumer\u2019s account information is probably blinded, so that not even the underwriter, or even the trustee, sees it as it goes through the trustee and onto the ATM network for authorisation."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The consumer\u2019s bank sends an authorisation message back to the trustee, who notifies the underwriter of the reserve account change, who in turn disburses digital cash certificates to the customer in the amount of her request. With the exception of the issuance of digital bearer cash instead of paper cash, this is roughly what happens with a private ATM machine."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "This is all done for whatever fee the underwriter charges, in the same way traveller\u2019s checks are sold at a premium at the time of sale, or that a foreign ATM machine charges for non-customer transactions. In fact, redeeming it off the net at par like a traveller\u2019s cheque, and exchanging it free for other digital bearer cash online is probably fundamental for merchant acceptance."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The consumer then uses the new cash to buy something from a merchant on the net. In theory, a merchant could do offline transactions, without involving a direct exchange and replacement of certificates from the underwriter, but they\u2019re ridiculously insecure from the standpoint of double spending."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "This exchange of certificates, this printing of new certificates at the time of each transaction, is still orders of magnitude cheaper than book-entry payment methods, and, since it\u2019s blinded by cryptographic protocol, the transaction retains its bearer quality. That is, the asset changes hands anonymously (on the net at least), it exists in only one place at one time, and the only proof required for non-repudiation is the certificate itself. Just like dollar bills, only three orders of magnitude cheaper than an internet debit or a credit card transaction."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "With the transaction over, the merchant can instantly spend his newly minted cash certificate somewhere else, this time for free, because the longer it stays on the net, the more interest it earns in the underwriter\u2019s reserve account, all at minimal cost to the underwriter."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Or, the merchant can turn around and redeem the certificate at par through the underwriter, who in turn has the trustee clear the money through the ATM system to the merchant\u2019s bank in the exact reverse of the process which got the money onto the net in the first place."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "Notice, for the first time, it is technically possible to use the ATM system for a cash deposit from a foreign bank, in this case, from the trustee, on behalf of the underwriter, to the merchant\u2019s bank account. Finally, notice that, since the wallets will probably be free, anyone can get paid in cash over the internet. They only need a bank account to put money on the net or take it off, important in the early stages, but not nearly so as time goes on."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "The other thing the model creates is something I call microintermediation. Because of the information processing diseconomies of scale in Moore\u2019s law, we have lots of small, automated financial intermediaries, each one operating directly between a given buyer and seller. This, I believe, is the logical outcome of financial disintermediation, which, until now, has been about removing multiple intermediaries between a buyer and seller. As we\u2019re starting to see in the internet search engine market, we\u2019ll start to see a speciation of financial intermediaries, by financial instrument, risk, etcetera, all brought about by Moore\u2019s law. After all, no single processor in a geodesic network can handle all the traffic."}

Digital bearer cash is treated just like physical cash in the eyes of regulators, and is subject to the same regulations. There is no functional difference between a digital cash underwriter and an ATM machine. And, yet, on the net itself, transactions are perfectly anonymous."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "This is the ultimate paradox of digital bearer settlement. The transaction protocols are so strong cryptographically that you don\u2019t need identity to keep your trades from breaking.

Book-entry settlement and the ad baculum argument at the core of the very idea of the modern industrial nation-state are intimately related.

Bearer shares are typically registered with a trustee of some kind, but that registration is blinded from the portfolio manager.

So we use checks, or bank wires. Somebody goes to a web page, is issued a non-transferable provisional certificate right off the bat, and, when the wire or cheque clears, they can come back and get real bearer certificates in exchange for the provisional one."}

Whenever digital bearer cash is available, handling shareholder exchanges will be even that much cheaper. Again, as a portfolio manager, you don\u2019t ever know who your customers are, anyway. The trustee administers your customer\u2019s money in the logical opposite of an American blind trust. Instead of the customers not knowing what the portfolio\u2019s invested in, though, the portfolio manager doesn\u2019t know, legally, who\u2019s invested in his fund. Which is the rub."}

This one is one where you\u2019d least expect it, in the heart of the institutional clearing system, literally under EuroClear\u2019s nose. Big institutions in Europe decided they needed a place to function for the myriad European exchanges in the same way that the Depository Trust Company does for the New York Stock Exchange. They hired J.P. Morgan to play that role, and called the system EuroClear. The problem is that the costs of the system are such that smaller institutions can\u2019t really afford to clear their trades there. A bunch of us figured, over some nice Australian Cabernet (and, um, kangaroo), that if you applied the model of digital bearer underwriting we talked about in July, and used Morgan as the institutional custodian for a jointly-held aggregate account, you could underwrite a bunch of closed-system bearer certificates against those shares and money, which a \u2018club\u2019 of smaller institutions could use to instantaneously clear trades against each other. Since this \u2018club\u2019 of smaller institutions would all be known to each other in the aggregate, all of the \u2018know your customer\u2019 rules could be adhered to, and, yet, the system could still, paradoxically, settle trades anonymously between club members."}

Maybe, someday, anonymity in settlement could translate to anonymity in execution itself\u2026 This rather insidious application of digital bearer technology, at the very place where one would expect the next generation of book-entry technology to be deployed, is exactly what Sun Tsu, Stonewall Jackson, and I mean by \u2018hit \u2018em where they ain\u2019t\u2019."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/", "title": "The Geodesic Market", "text": "At the end of last month I began building the revenue model for IBUC, the Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation, which I founded here in Boston, and wrote about in the last issue. You can \u2018back\u2019 into some pretty interesting numbers without doing a market test at all, something which is, frankly, impossible anyway, given the mostly unknown, and not insignificant capital cost of building the MicroMint box, for instance. First, you need an adoption curve. Typically, people in marketing use the logistics equation\u2019s curve. In our case, however, we had some real data, the historical and estimated future dollar volume of internet retail transactions, which, of course, are mostly credit card transactions. We got some from a fairly reliable source. These adoption curves start in the small hundreds of millions in 1995 or so, and, from 1996, they grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 100% or so over the last four years, into the tens of billions for this year. Using this time series, we now have as good a guess for an adoption curve as any for a proposed digital bearer payment technology. If something proves useful, it\u2019ll probably be adopted this fast, and if done right, probably won\u2019t be complementary or competitive with existing transaction types, thus increasing the dollar volume of internet transactions over time. So, we can take this normalised curve and tweak it for all transactions executed by mulitiplying the credit card number by some factor, or, we can use it fractionally, like we did, to gin up some numbers for a specific product. Again, you can back into a fairly nice approximation with actual data. Every year, the Bank for International Settlement publishes a report showing the global transaction counts and dollar volumes by each payment method, cash, credit cards, checks, wire, ACH, and so forth. Since virtually all transactions on the internet are executed with credit cards, if an meatspace-equivalent-risk digital form existed in digital bearer form, it\u2019s safe to assume that we might apply the meatspace ratio of that method to credit cards to the cypherspace credit card number. Of course, that doesn\u2019t work so good for MicroMint-based microcash, which doesn\u2019t have a meatspace equivalent, but it\u2019s a good start. So, use that factor times whatever market penetration number you think you can justify, and you have, voila, a revenue curve. So, now, we need an upper bound to all this unbounded enthusiasm. My CFO and I were wondering how we were going to do this, when, we remembered that we were in the underwriting business. After rooting around a bit, it dawned on us that Goldman Sachs had just filed a shelf offering for their IPO, so we went to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s EDGAR website to go look at it. Right up there, on a metaphorical movie screen, was about a megabyte of information on how to be an underwriter, including the size of the global capital markets, Goldman\u2019s underwriting revenue and profits, and a whole host of other goodies. When we got through reading this, we were swinging from the lamp posts."}

Companies such as Dell and Cisco get a majority of their multi-billion-dollar revenues straight from the web, for instance. The total amount of internet commerce is expected by several sources to top a trillion dollars by 2002. With the very sizeable exception of financial assets (a majority of all individual stock trades will soon be originated from the internet, for instance), and travel services, most of that projected internet commerce revenue will still be for items you can physically touch, things which are delivered later, instead of now, things which you\u2019ll keep after you purchase them and not literally throw away after a single use."}

Not at all. Advertisements on the web have shown themselves to be eminently ignorable by the web-browsing public, and, as a result, advertising revenue has actually fallen, and considerably so. Every large web-content site you have ever heard of has a huge budget for advertising outside the net, print, magazine, television, even radio, because ads on the internet itself just aren\u2019t that effective. And, yet, what these very firms sell, ostensibly, is internet advertising, and not the actual content of their websites. So, while things haven\u2019t reached panic proportions yet in the content business, it will be interesting to see how content providers are going to react to all this."}

Or, at least, you could do it that way, if you could lower your transaction costs far enough. In other words, in a geodesic medium such as the net, it will probably turn out cheaper to actually pay the content\u2019s creator directly for custom content with digital bearer microcash than it is to \u2018target\u2019 advertising through one or more industrially-organised \u2018infomediaries\u2019 (or whatever McKinsey\u2019 s buzzword-du-jour is these days)."}

That is, accountants, not markets, attempt to calculate the value of whatever content an advertiser purchases on behalf of that content\u2019s consumers, using not-always-accurate heuristics like cost per thousand impressions, say, or percentage audience share. As most serious students of finance already know, it was the demonstration of the near-impossibility calculating a transfer price which resulted in most of the Nobel prises in economics given out in the last few decades. And so, as I\u2019ve said about financial cryptography and cryptography itself, financial economics is the only economics that matters these days. In fact, the only time transfer pricing is even attempted is when transaction costs outside the firm were too high, for one reason or another, to get a market price. This is, of course, Coase\u2019s theorem, the fundamental theorem of microeconomics, and that theorem, in turn, is the very definition of what is, or isn\u2019t, a firm.

However, it now appears, the market for that unitary proxy has fallen. Does mean that there\u2019ll be no more content on the internet, especially at very low cost? Hardly. It only means that transfer pricing doesn\u2019t work as a way to pay for internet content.

Industrial-era record companies, publishers, and entertainment networks are all still fairly hierarchical entities today, even though the economics of Moore\u2019s law has changed their business considerably over the last thirty or forty years. It\u2019s not without a reason that the most important person in the movie business these days is the artist\u2019s agent, and not the studio head, for instance. Digital bearer cash, at sufficiently small denominations, probably the $10-3 (a tenth of a penny) range, or maybe lower, enables the direct purchase, and, more important, the immediate disposal of content after its use."}

In the BFH system there would be no common medium of exchange with a fixed nominal value in terms of the unit of account. Instead, assets with variable prices are used. This implies that, in principle, any asset could serve as a medium of exchange. An example that is often used to illustrate \u2018moneyless\u2019 payments are mutual funds shares. The value of mutual funds\u2019 shares varies with the value of the funds\u2019 assets and within certain limits they can be used for making payments. So, the medium of payment \u2018mutual fund share\u2019 has a value that is not fixed in terms of the commonly used unit of account. Eugene Fama (1980) argues that monetary separation is efficient because the financial system (Fama uses the term \u2018banks\u2019) serves two functions that are independent of each other: the accounting function and the portfolio management function. Banks could fulfill the accounting function without holding assets or using any medium of payment. It would be sufficient to have a unit of account. As an uninvolved third party, banks could just keep records of transactions. The issue of liabilities and the purchase of assets is derived from the second function, the portfolio management function. In this function banks help individuals to hold their wealth in a form they desire."}

Why keep something which doesn\u2019t earn you money, in other words? Why not use something which is as risk-free as possible but still earns money while it\u2019s in your possession? Furthermore, the longer money\u2019s going to be in your possession, the more incentive you have to invest in something where short-term volatility isn\u2019t a problem.

Banks go back to being \u201ccounting houses\u201d instead of fiduciaries, trustees, keeping track of who owes what to whom, and the returns on money are higher for the users of that money. The advent of the money-market mutual fund, was, of course, a step down this road."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "To expand on these:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "It is obviously difficult to operate a remailer service that charges if other people are offering the equivalent service for free. Since it is pretty easy to start up a remailer, the marginal cost to do so is low, hence the profits are low, too. However, although it is easy to start a remailer, it is not so easy to keep one running in the face of complaints from recipients of abusive mail or inappropriate posts; hassles from sysops, owners, net feeds, or others upwards in that great chain of command; possible law enforcement problems when illegal communications occur; possible threats of lawsuits (such as from the scientologists when their sacred documents are posted), etc. So we should not be misled into thinking that running a remailer is cost free."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "One issue is of course the additional difficulty this will cause in the use of the remailer. There are several things to consider here. On the one hand you could argue that it is already too difficult to use the remailers, and any additional hassles involved with including some kind of payment tokens would kill the market. OTOH I can agree in spirit with the sentiments expressed here recently about the low quality which seems to characterize much of the use of the remailers."}

But still, it is discouraging. In that context, maybe making the system a little harder to use would be worthwhile, in that it would screen out the casual harrasser. (Or, more realistically, this might just keep the exceptionally motivated harrassers.)"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "In any case, I think the presence of the remailer scripts can make using a for-pay remailer not much more difficult than using a free one.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "Now, the next question is the details of the payment. Frankly, I don't think any of the current systems are quite right for us due to our special needs, but things are changing rapidly. Let me describe something about how they work."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "I know of two systems that are VISA/Mastercard based. One is called First Virtual (http://www.fv.com). They are oriented towards information sales and say that they aren't for service providers, but in practice it looked to me like they could be used for services. When a customer wants to pay, he sends you his FV ID. You send this to FV and they send an email message to the customer asking whether he authorizes the payment. If he says \"yes\", FV credits your account. You get a check every month. Customers who always say \"no\" get booted out of the system (as do merchants who submit bogus bills). They charge 29 cents plus 2 percent per transaction, but merchants can batch up multiple orders by a single customer before sending it in."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "There are a few problems with a system like this, many of which are somewhat generic to our situation. The most fundamental is that we don't know who our customers are much of the time. In fact, the whole point of the remailer network is that we not know that fact for any case except the first hop in the chain. If we required customers to expose their FV account ID at every hop, it would make it a lot easier to track messages through the network (even if the ID's were hidden in the encryption envelope it seems risky). If we then sent a message to FV saying that we needed to charge ID XXX, and FV responds with an email to the person's home address, this offers more possibilities for tracing."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "One solution would be only to charge on entry into the remailer net. Perhaps remailer operators would even charge each other then, and the first remailer would charge some larger amount to deal with a \"typical\" chain length? Many interesting possibilities here."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "Another issue is that the overhead charges by FV would require batching up messages before submitting them. Let me make clear that the batch must consist all of charges to a single user. It doesn't do any good to send one message to FV asking them to please charge a penny to each of 100 VISA accounts. No, you would have to count messages from each user, separately, and when user XXX had sent, say, $1 worth of messages, you could send in the request to FV and get back 70 or so cents."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "So this adds some overhead and record-keeping that we don't currently have to do, although perhaps it is not so difficult.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "The other VISA based system is called OpenMarket. I just read about it tonight so I don't know it as well (http://www.openmarket.com). It is pretty tied to the WWW so it would not seem to work for us. Customers get connected to a particular WWW server which authenticates them and charges their VISA card appropriately, then they get redirected to the merchant with some kind of token that says they have paid."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "The NetBank (email to netbank-intro@agents.com) is a digital-cash like system. Customers get tokens which are basically large secret numbers which have a cash value. They send them to the merchants, and the merchants then send them to the bank which credits their account. The NetBank sends you a check every month."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "The interesting thing is how customers buy the cash tokens. One way is by connecting to a 900 number with your modem. They charge the customer $10.00 and give him a digital cash token worth that much. Another way is by faxing a check to them. I wasn't clear on how you get the cash token back in that case; I guess they email it to you at an address you specify. From the privacy point of view, these are not that great; 900 numbers have Automatic Number Identification so unless you are willing to tramp out to a pay phone to get your cash then it could be linked to your phone number. And the fax system must have some kind of return address that would link to you."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "The other problem with NetBank is that the smallest denomination which can be spent is 25 cents. Due to the cash-like nature of the tokens, I don't see a natural way to accumulate several messages into one payment. Maybe we could layer our own low-value digital cash system on top of NetBank, where users could buy our anonymous cash for 25 cents and get enough tokens for 25 messages, then we would settle amongst ourselves (or actually with the anon-mail-token bank). Actually this might help with the privacy problems, too. Anonymous digital cash is heavily patented, though."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "With a cash-like system, each message would include a numeric token in the header which is the digital cash.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "NetBank charges $4 per month, plus, for the 900-number-based cash, 20% off of face value."}

Chaum is the inventor of digital cash and he certainly knows his stuff, plus as I said he has the intellectual property pretty well sewed up patent-wise. The DC payment system is also WWW based at present. The customer has to be running a special program on his computer, separate from his web browser. This program holds his digital cash, which is similar conceptually to the NetBank cash but more sophisticated cryptographically. When he wants to buy something, the merchant's web server makes a connection to the customer's DC program, and it transfers the cash to the merchant."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "DigiCash says they are planning an email based system but for now their emphasis is on the WWW. Right now they are only in beta and not using real money. I don't know when they will be real and email based, and I don't know if they have said what their commission will be. But when this comes up it may be the best approach if small-value transactions can be supported. DigiCash is fully anonymous in the sense that once a customer receives the money, it is \"blinded\" in a special cryptographic way so that the bank cannot associate it with that customer (and no one else can, either). This kind of anonymity fits in very well with our remailer requirements."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/", "title": "For-Pay Remailers", "text": "Well, I know this is a lot of information to work through, but mostly I want people to be aware of the possibilities. Most of this stuff is very, very new, only weeks old, generally. Probably over the next few months we will see a lot more options appear. I am confident that there will soon be payment systems that would provide the technical basis for fee based remailing. I don't expect anyone to get rich by this, but it might help compensate for the risks we all face, and it might serve to improve the quality of the remailer network."}

You do not have a right to be hired to fly airplanes\u2014and, if you choose to exercise your right not to be tested, you should not be surprised if the airline exercises its right not to hire you. The background legal principle is not that I have a right to be hired as a pilot or that United Airlines has a right to have me fly their planes. The background principle is that they can hire me to fly their planes if and only if both they and I agree.

In the entire world over the past century, something on the order of ten million people have been killed by private murderers. Between a hundred and two hundred million have been killed by the governments that ruled them (Rummel (1999) estimates about 170 million from 1900 to 1987). Quite a lot of individual pain, suffering, injustice has been due to the acts of private individuals; some could have been prevented by better law enforcement. But mass pain, suffering and injustice has been very nearly a monopoly of governments. If governments were better able to control us, there would have been more of it.

Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow. It's about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints. There are separate engineering disciplines, such as computer science, for assessing the physical limitations of a technology itself, including the resource capacities needed for a technology to handle a greater number of users or a greater rate of use.

The social scalability of an institutional technology depends on how that technology constrains or motivates participation in that institution, including protection of participants and the institution itself from harmful participation or attack. One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits. The cultural and jurisdictional diversity of people who can beneficially participate in an institution is also often important, especially in the global Internet context.

Modern information technology (IT), especially by making use of the historically recent discoveries of computer science, can often discover many more mutually beneficial matches, can improve motivations for information quality, and can reduce the need for trust within certain kinds of institutional transactions, with respect to an increasingly large number and variety of people, thereby further increasing social scalability in some very important ways."}

In most cases an often trusted and sufficiently trustworthy institution (such as a market) depends on its participants trusting, usually implicitly, another sufficiently trustworthy institution (such as contract law). These trusted institutions in turn traditionally implement a variety of accounting, legal, security, or other controls that make them usually and sufficiently, at least for facilitating the functionality of their client institutions, trustworthy, by minimizing vulnerability to their own participants (such as accountants, lawyers, regulators, and investigators).

As another example, in our strongest consensus protocols harmful behavior by certain fractions of participants or intermediaries well short of 100% (as measured by their computing power, stake-holding, or individuation and counting) can compromise the integrity of transactions or information flows between participants and thereby on balance harm the participants.

Even data sent encrypted over a network is eventually unencrypted and ends up on a computer controlled in this total way. With current web services we are fully trusting, in other words we are fully vulnerable to, the computer, or more specifically the people who have access to that computer, both insiders and hackers, to faithfully execute our orders, secure our payments, and so on. If somebody on the other end wants to ignore or falsify what you've instructed the web server to do, no strong security is stopping them, only fallible and expensive human institutions, which often stop at national borders."}

The conclusions are fascinating and led to a new line of thinking about the structure of space-time."}

In biology, especially in the theory of social evolution, this is often treated explicitly in terms of the language of game theoryiii. In economics theory this is done somewhat less often, but ultimately any discussion of incentives, which is what economics consists of, can be treated in terms of game theory. Both theories suppose that the strategy which produces the greatest benefit for individual actors will tend to win out. In biology, it is assumed that the natural selection is the means by which this happens, whereas in economics this happens because of learning or cultural evolution."}

In biology, the problem is often to explain how highly cooperative and altruistic behavior can be explained in terms of the self-interested behavior of organisms attempting to spread their genes. In the 1960\u2019s, an idea had become popular in biology called group selection, which is that selection can act on groups of organisms rather than just on individuals, and consequently that organisms can have traits which can be deleterious to individuals yet beneficial to the group as a whole. However, if any individual in a group could out breed its fellows by reducing those deleterious traits, it would. Adaptations which appear to be good for the group must therefore, always be good for the individualiv."}

In biology, an animal\u2019s psychology is just like any other body part\u2014it evolved to serve specific purposes. Therefore, we do not explain animal behavior in terms of how it feels or wants. Its feelings and desires are to be explained in the same way as everything else about it: as part of a strategy to maximize expected future offspring. In economics, we wish to explain peoples\u2019 actions in terms of consumption. Consumption may be anything that may be treated as an immediate reward. It does not matter what a person claims about why he does something. What matters is what he actually chooses, and the problem of economics is to explain his choices in terms of his preferences. It is easy to see that this approach is necessary by the way people treat money: though everyone uses it every day, very few can give a satisfactory explanation of it."}

Experimental psychology thus treats organisms more like physical processes which are expected to respond in predictable ways to past stimuli, whereas in economics and evolutionary biology, organisms are goal-oriented, machines that respond to incentives (that is, expected rewards and punishments) in search of some optimum."}

Typically in game theory, we define equilibrium strategies in terms of players with perfect knowledge of the game, who are able to compare the likely outcomes of every strategy and who assume the same of their opponents. Of course, it is not true that the organisms being modeled by the game actually know anything about strategy\u2014or anything at all\u2014but the game-theoretic models still work.

However, the mechanism of adapation is irrelevant: it just means that humans adapt much more quickly than other animals. The objection that humans are too irrational for economic theory to apply to them is a failure to think in behaviorist terms. People must necessarily adapt to a set of rewards and punishments, and they do so by learning. We do not need to assume that people reason their way to the best strategies in a game; we only need to assume that people tend to imitate the more successful among them, and that consequently the more successful behaviors tend to beat out the less successful.

Goods which are considered to be valued for the immediate satisfaction they provide when they are consumed are called consumer goods. Not all goods are consumer goods, however, and the value of everything which is not a consumer good must be explained in terms of the consumption that it ultimately makes possible. For example, people generally do not want to own factories just because they like factories; they want to own a factory in order to earn a profit with it, which they can then spend on consumption. A factory is an example of a capital good. Ultimately its existence in the economy can be explained because it can be used to produce other goods."}

There is one ultimate value, and that is the maximization of an individual\u2019s expected future offspring, or more properly, the maximization of the expected rate with which its genes will spread throughout a population. A puzzle in biology is when an organism exhibits behavior that appears to devalue things like food and status because it is very easy to see how such things would promote its survival and mating success. If an organism gives food away or rejects status, then that needs to be explained. On the other hand, in economics there is no particular need to explain someone who is an anorexic or a cynic philosopher. That would be a job for a psychologist; to an economist those are just his preferences. Consequently, whereas in economics, interpersonal comparisons of value are impossible, in biology they are possible between members of the same species."}

There is even a concept in biology called parasitic altruism, which means that an animal is a host to a parasite and is better off continuing to feed the parasite than attempting to remove it, which would be too expensive.

Fitness must be understood in an experimental sense.

For example, consider the case of a bunch of soldiers who go to war for their home country. They are behaving altruistically toward the people of their nation because they are putting themselves at risk in order to keep their friends at home safe. Let us say that most of these soldiers will die. Can their altruism still be explained in terms of future benefits? Yes, certainly. For some of the soldiers will survive and will return home to receive great honor and status, and it is not known who will survive beforehand. If the expected value of ones future status as a veteran offsets the probable cost of dying horribly in battle, then it can be expected that soldiers will want to go to war."}

If I worked hard and everyone else slacked off, then I would be taken advantage of. Everyone must do his duty or the system fails. By the same token, if I begin to accept payment in money and to hold savings in it, I am depending on other people behaving the same way. What if I started saving in money, but no one else did so? Then I will have done a lot of work for nothing because my money would not be accepted anywhere.

There is no need to know anything about another person in order to detect cheating. You do not need to know his group loyalty. You only need to know whether he has money or not.

This does not explain how monetary behavior begins, but it explains why it persists once it is established, and it does so by reference to the individual benefit of the behavior. This answer may seem trivial or obvious, but it is not: how many people go around thinking of the money in their pockets as a means of punishing one another for not being altruistic enough?

The other condition required of reciprocal altruism is that there should be lots of expected future opportunities to call in favors. In monetary economics, the word for this is liquidity, and it roughly refers to the demand for money. A money is more liquid the more easily a given sum of goods can be sold for money without markedly altering its demand. If a money is liquid, therefore, then many opportunities for redeeming favors all around. If money is illiquid, then society might run out of favors to give before one runs out of money, which means that the money must become less valuable. Thus, as with other forms of altruism, therefore, money has a network effect. If lots of people want lots of money, then the system is more effective than when few people want it."}

Even knowing nothing of the technology or culture of different lands, probably no one there can cheaply manufacture gold and silver.

We could imagine an honest fiat money that was never issued under false pretenses, though this is certainly not the historical norm. The result is a kind of money which is much more portable than commodity money but whose scarcity is protected by the promise of the issuing institution rather than the physical difficulty of producing it.

First, what gives money value? An adherent of commodity money might say that it is the industrial uses of the money good, whereas an adherent of fiat money might say that it is the force of the government issuing it, and the loyalty people have toward their government. Neither of these answers is true. It is true that some system is required to keep track of who has money and who does not, but that is not what makes money valuable. The value of money is the value of cooperation. It is that simple. The value of money is not somehow in the monetary unit; it is in the whole of society and in peoples\u2019 desire to cooperate."}

Evidently not; changes to the money supply only prevent the money from functioning as a form of reciprocal altruism. Whoever first received the new money would be able to spend it without having done anything to earn it. Such a money system allows non-altruists to benefit. It allows for cheating. It would be possible, of course, for all money everywhere to multiply by the same proportion at the same time. This could be done for real in a distributed system. If that happened, no one would benefit disproportionately. But what would be the point? Doing so clearly changes nothing about the real state of the economy and would have only the effect of immediately changing all prices by the inverse proportion."}

If making money means just granting favors, then it is not inherently antisocial no matter how much money someone makes. The only question is whether it is possible to give out favors that are not as beneficial as they may at first appear, but this is a very subjective question that would arise in any system of cooperation. A person who has a high income is just someone able to provide very useful favors. A person with a large savings is even better; he is someone willing to donate to the economy without demanding much back. If he spends his money eventually, then he was giving to the economy on a loan; if he is willing to maintain his savings permanently, then he is willing to remain permanently invested in the future productivity of the economy.

The possibility of becoming one of those extra-helpful individuals is part of the benefit of altruism, and it is therefore part of the incentive that fosters cooperation.

Both the money economy and ideological groups are enablers of group altruism. Consequently, they are in competition with one another. Both require investment of their members\u2019 time and effort, and a person can only give so much. Yet the money economy gives such a superior return for most things than do ideological groups that it leaves the groups at a severe disadvantage.

Economic equations do not add up. That is a hard-to-deny reality; it is suffocating many and it applies globally. Politicians simply are not the answer. The fundamental problem with the current economic structure lies not in politics, but in the currencies which coordinate economic activity (e.g. the dollar, euro, yen, peso, bolivar, etc.). The chink in the armor is in the foundation. No politician can fix problems that stem from structural flaws inherent to modern money.

If an economy is functionally breaking down, it would be more appropriate to say that the underlying currency is not effectively coordinating economic activity; the currency is the input and the economy is the output. In short, the fly in the ointment is the money. While many are focused on how to solve the problem of massive wealth inequality, very few connect that the greatest source of inequity lies in the tool that everyone is using to coordinate the entire orchestra. It is not just that the economy is not working for many; it is that the dollar (or euro, yen, etc) as the primary mechanism coordinating economic resources is failing for everyone. Economic imbalance and growing inequality is the new normal, but there is nothing natural about sustained economic imbalance. In fact, it is an economic oxymoron. Balance is critical to the functioning of any economy, and when functioning properly, an economy would naturally eliminate imbalance in its normal course. If an economy fails to do so, and instead allows imbalance to be sustained, that is evidence of a broken economic structure. But, the massive and growing economic imbalance which exists today is not the inevitable and unavoidable consequence of free market capitalism; instead, it is principally a result of central bank monetary policy, which allows economic imbalances to be sustained in ways that would otherwise not be possible."}

The structural flaw inherent to the dollar currency system (or any fiat currency system) is the force most responsible for sustained economic imbalance. Unsustainable and extreme wealth disparity follow from that imbalance. Every other distortive economic action or policy exists at higher orders than the issues created by the manipulation of the money itself. That is the root of all structural economic problems, and until it is fixed, the world will remain suspended in an increasingly fragile state. The legacy monetary system centralizes and consolidates wealth; that is the output of sustaining and exacerbating economic imbalance. It is a system that works for a few in the short-term but fails for all in the long run because the end game of monetary manipulation and an ever-growing economic imbalance is instability.

Bitcoin levels the playing field and ensures that the monetary system cannot itself be a source of extreme inequity. It does so by guaranteeing certain inalienable rights. Every holder of the currency is provided the assurance that more units of the currency will not be arbitrarily produced, and each unit of the currency is treated equally within the network. Bitcoin more effectively coordinates economic activity because its pricing mechanism cannot be distorted or manipulated by exogenous forces, which is the fatal flaw of the legacy currency system.

The utility of money is to intermediate a series of exchanges. Receive, hold, spend (h/t @pierre_rochard), that simple. Money is the intermediary good used to both establish and trade value. As the market converges on a common form of money, a price system emerges, which allows for the subjective concept of value to be more objectively measured. Money is the pricing mechanism and the output is a pricing system. The price system communicates information; it aggregates individual preferences within an economy and communicates those preferences through local prices, as measured in a common monetary medium. Change in prices reflects changes in preferences."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-one-for-all/", "title": "Bitcoin is One for All", "text": "Because preferences are ever changing, so too are prices. Within a developed economy, there are millions of goods, each with individual prices resulting in billions of relative price signals. Relative price signals ultimately communicate exchange ratios between various combinations of goods. While the value of any single good may be static for a period of time, certain prices are always changing within an economy, which dictates that relative prices are ever changing. An economy constantly works to find balance through the aggregate changes in price levels. Anyone and everyone within an economy reacts to the price signals most relevant to their own preferences, which naturally change and become dynamically influenced by changing prices themselves. Through the price system, individual market participants learn both what others value and what they need to produce to meet their own needs. As prices change, behaviors change, and everyone adapts. The price system is the visible hand which allows for balance to be achieved and for imbalance to be identified and eliminated. Long-term economic stability is achieved because variable information is constantly communicated through the price system. It is the fluctuation in prices inherent to undistorted markets that actively prevents large scale and systemic imbalances from forming."}

When a central bank targets the stability of any price level, it is actually working in opposition to the natural course of an economy, which seeks to find balance and to adapt to a change in preferences through the price system. Worse yet, the means by which a central bank works to achieve price stability is through the manipulation of the money supply, which distorts the entire pricing mechanism underpinning the economy. With every exogenous attempt to achieve price stability, the central bank actively allows imbalances to be sustained and distributes bad information to every person within the economy through false price signals, which in turn causes further imbalances to grow. Imagine this happening each time the economy tried to find balance. By sustaining imbalance, those that principally benefited from the existence of imbalance are continuously advantaged at the expense of everyone else."}

In aggregate, market participants were communicating an increasing demand for money relative to a decreasing demand to hold real estate. At that particular moment in time, the actual amount of money and the available supply of real estate were not rapidly changing. Instead, preferences within the economy were shifting as were relative price signals. Rather than allow the economy to find balance and eliminate imbalance, the Fed increased the supply of dollars in an effort to \u201cstabilize\u201d the dollar value of real estate. More literally, it created $1.7 trillion dollars and used those newly minted dollars to purchase mortgage-backed securities as a direct means to support the value of real estate. Those that owned real estate (e.g. housing) or operated businesses dealing in the production (or financing) of real estate benefited disproportionately at the expense of those that did not.

The market function to eliminate imbalance would have been for prices to change. The Fed\u2019s solution was the opposite. It devalued the money (by increasing its supply), such that the value of real estate (among other goods) as priced in dollars would change the least. Rather than eliminate imbalance, the Fed\u2019s actions allowed imbalances to be sustained and actually grow. Once one actually appreciates the fundamental role which money and the pricing mechanism play in coordinating economic activity, it becomes clear as day that sustaining imbalance is precisely what occurs each time the Fed intervenes to stabilize price levels. Stability when achieved through manipulation merely suppresses volatility. It creates an unnatural rigidity in price, when price fluctuation is both a desired state and the natural function of a market communicating changes in preferences. When imbalances that would otherwise be eliminated are allowed to be sustained by artificial means and for extended periods of time, it ultimately creates greater volatility in the long run and critically impairs the ability of a monetary medium to coordinate economic activity, which is its singular utility. Each time and cumulatively, it advantages and further embeds the incumbents, just as the market is working to eliminate imbalance."}

Artificially preventing changes in price, aka a price stability mandate, is what lights the fire in the first place. The Fed coopts the entire value chain of the pricing mechanism. Change in price is actually desired and the central bank works in opposition to that change by manipulating the money supply. The formation of imbalance within an economy is natural; creating a centralized mechanism which prevents imbalances from being eliminated is the unnatural and damaging part. It also creates long-term economic instability by distorting price signals over decades and widens the wealth gap by constantly advantanging those on the right side of imbalance. Predictably and unironically, the existence of the central bank\u2019s price stability mandate, combined with the power to print money, causes both long-term instability and sustained economic imbalances."}

Rigidity in price or quantity of any economic good driven by exogenous forces results in imbalance; variance allows for balance and equilibrium. Very logical and not controversial. Why then is the same not understood when applied to money? Imbalances are created when central banks target interest rates through the manipulation of the supply of money, just as imbalances are created when the Venezuelan government arbitrarily sets the price of a gallon of gas below its market value. Ironically, the manipulation of the money supply happens to be economically more destructive because it distorts all prices within an economy, and all relative price signals as individual price levels do not adjust ratably (in fact, far from it). When the Fed pursues its price stability mandate, it is actively sending false price signals throughout an economy and causing imbalances in supply and demand structures to be sustained. Price stability is price manipulation, and it is perfectly predictable that when the price of money is manipulated to achieve any definition of stability, the very action causes a degree of economic distortion far worse than the manipulation of any single market."}

As the economy slows and as price levels begin to change counter to the Fed\u2019s desired course, the Fed increases the supply of dollars in the financial system by purchasing debt instruments (typically government treasuries) and crediting the accounts of the sellers with newly minted dollars. At the onset, the credit system was just a tool to effect monetary policy; it was the mechanism through which the Fed pursued price stability. Increase the supply of dollars by purchasing credit instruments, reduce interest rates by that same mechanism, induce economic expansion via cheap credit and cause general price levels to stabilize. That was the theory and intent. However, predictably, this pattern caused imbalances to form and be sustained in the credit system itself. Now the tail is wagging the dog. Today, the credit system in the U.S. stands at $77.9 trillion system wide, whereas there are only $4.5 trillion actual dollars within the banking system. For every dollar that exists, approximately $17 dollars of dollar-denominated debt exists (debt-to-dollars of 17:1). Again, this is an imbalance only made possible and sustained as a function of the Fed. Each time the credit system attempts to contract, the Fed creates more dollars to help maintain the size of the credit system, such that it can further expand. Because the credit system is now orders of magnitude larger than the base money supply, economic activity today is largely coordinated by the allocation and expansion of credit rather than by the base money itself. In aggregate, the credit system is the marginal price setter given its size relative to the base money supply. Because of its price stability mandate, the Fed has an implicit mandate to maintain the size of the credit system, and in order to do so, it must target asset prices that support existing debt levels. It has become circular. The Fed used the credit system as a tool to stabilize price levels but now it must maintain the size of the credit system in order to maintain stable prices."}

In 1971, President Nixon officially ended all convertibility of dollars to gold, and the U.S. government later decoupled the value of the dollar from gold altogether in 1976. While the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 was the beginning and President Roosevelt\u2019s executive order in 1933 banning private ownership of gold set the stage, the complete departure from gold as a monetary anchor in the 1970s removed constraints that otherwise prevented the true centralization of the money supply, and which ultimately enabled the great monetary inflation which Paul Tudor Jones recently wrote about. Once the final constraints were removed, it opened the door for the Fed to take a more central role in actively managing the economy via the money supply, which it ultimately effects through the credit system. As a direct consequence, the base money supply and the credit system have expanded in ways that would otherwise not have been possible, allowing imbalances to consistently grow over time and creating long-term economic distortions."}

This is the real reason why the banking sector and the function of credit has become as large as it has; it would not have been possible if the Fed were not able to print money to artificially sustain unsustainable levels of debt, all in the interest of \u201cprice stability.\u201d Effectively, each time the banking sector would otherwise contract, the Fed takes measures to actively prevent it. It sounds crazy because it is, but it exists the way it does because the credit system is the primary transmission mechanism of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. The Fed needs the credit system to be maintained because it is through this vehicle that the Fed attempts to \u201cmanage\u201d the economy. The Fed sees targeting asset prices to sustain debt levels as less disruptive than allowing debt to be restructured and written off. In the Fed\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s six one way, half a dozen the other; effectively the same, but with less disruption.

Initially, the effects are at best zero-sum. Those at the top benefit, those at the bottom suffer. In the end, everyone loses because the end game is economic instability. Notice the negative correlation below between housing prices and housing affordability, and then recognize that housing prices are actively manipulated by the Fed.

Of 21 million, approximately 18.5 million bitcoin are already in circulation. The 18.5 million in circulation are all held by some individual or entity. In order to acquire any, bitcoin must be earned by delivering value to those that hold the currency. Even for those not yet circulating, every single bitcoin must be earned by contributing value. The same is not true of the current monetary system. In the current structure, dollars can either be earned by delivering value to others within the economy, or conversely, if the Fed decides to hand out more money. And this happens quite frequently. Of all the dollars that exist today, over 80% have been created and allocated by the Fed since 2008 (source link), rather than by the alternative \u2013 delivering value to others within the economy.

No value leaks outside the system; no inefficiency can be introduced through the production of money. Whether new entrants are joining the network or trade occurs from within, value is always transferred, and through that transfer, value is actually created. Recall that the valuable function of money is to coordinate economic activity. The production of money, on the other hand, produces no value and only serves to distort and impair the ability of a monetary medium to properly function.

A fixed amount of currency plus more people valuing it equals greater distribution of the currency. With a fixed supply, no more than 21 million bitcoin can ever be saved and paradoxically, that change in the incentive structure will cause more people to save. By introducing an incentive to save (i.e. a fixed supply), more people will. And as more people save in a currency which has a fixed supply, it results in more and more people owning less and less but through that function of more people saving, it creates greater stability. Whereas the centralized control of the money supply and the ability to sustain imbalance causes wealth to consolidate, a fixed money supply naturally causes the currency to become further decentralized and more distributed, delivering greater balance."}

The structure of the currency dictates the opposite effect, and the trend can be seen in actual data. Bitcoin held in smaller denominations continues to grow steadily, while bitcoin held in larger denominations continues to decline. As the currency and economic system grows, the currency becomes more widely distributed. Rather than consolidate, the currency distributes to more people, and the nominal amount held by each declines, while purchasing power increases. As more people demand the currency, its value rises. However, there is a terminally fixed supply. As increases in demand naturally outpace ever diminishing increases in supply, there is one principal way to acquire bitcoin: by delivering value to an existing holder of the currency. The currency transfers from relatively few early holders to a more widely distributed base as a function of time. Everyone wins; the network utility increases as more participants voluntarily opt in and the distribution of the currency becomes less and less concentrated, ensuring greater balance and reducing systemic risks created by the existence of a few extremely large holders."}

It is no guarantee that someone else will value the currency more or less, but it eliminates the possibility of an involuntary forced devaluation of labor and output stored in a monetary medium, which distorts economic activity and creates false price signals. When presented with that opportunity relative to a certainty of the worse outcome, it becomes a clear choice. Compared to the current economic structure in which the wealthiest better understand the effects of active monetary debasement and are best equipped to combat and exploit it, there is a reality that those on the lower end of the economic spectrum have more to gain by leveling the playing field.

In many ways, the same is true of bitcoin. It is not an IQ test; instead, bitcoin is common sense and its implications are near universal. Few people have ever stopped to question or understand the function of money. It facilitates practically every transaction anyone has ever made, yet no one really knows the why of that equation, nor the properties that allow money to effectively coordinate economic activity. Its function is taken for granted, and as a result, it is a subject not widely taught or explored. Yet despite a limited baseline of knowledge, there is often a visceral reaction to the very idea of bitcoin as money. The default position is predictably no. Bitcoin is an anathema to all notions of existing custom. On the surface, it is entirely inconsistent with what folks know money to be. For most, money is just money because it always has been. In general, for any individual, the construction of money is anchored in time and it is very naturally not questioned."}

This is one of those rare instances when a thing does not walk like a duck or quack like a duck but it\u2019s actually a duck, and what you thought was a duck all along was mistakenly something entirely different.

Bitcoin has none of these traits (some not presently, others not ever), and as a result, it is most often dismissed as not meeting the standards of modern-day money. This is where overthinking a problem can cripple the highest of IQs. Pattern recognition fails because the game fundamentally changed, but the players do not yet realize it. It is akin to getting lost in the weeds or failing to see the forest through the trees. Bitcoin is finitely scarce, it is highly divisible and it is capable of being sent over a communication channel (and on a permissionless basis). There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. Rocket scientists and the most revered investors of our time could look at this equation relative to other applications in the market and be confounded, not seeing its value. While at the same time, if posed with a very simple question, would you rather be paid either in a currency with a fixed supply that cannot be manipulated or in a currency that is subject to persistent, systemic and significant debasement, an overwhelming majority of individuals would choose the former all day, every day."}

Individuals don\u2019t have to understand how or why there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin; all that has to be recognized in practical experience is that dollars are going to be worth significantly less in the future, and then the idea of having a currency with a fixed supply begins to make sense.

From an individual perspective, there is not a marginal difference in those two worlds; it is night and day, and anyone conscious of the decision very intuitively opts for the latter, recognizing that the former is neither sustainable, nor to his or her advantage. Imagine there were 100 individuals in an economy, each with different skills. All have determined to use a common form of money to facilitate trade in exchange for goods and services produced by others. With the one exception that a single individual has a superpower to print money, requiring no investment of time and at practically no cost. Given human time is an inherently scarce resource and that it is a required input in the production of any good or service demanded in trade, such a scenario would mean that one person would get to purchase the output of all the others for free. Why would anyone agree to such an arrangement? That the individual is an enterprise, and more specifically, a central bank expected to act in the public interest does not change the fundamental operation. If it does not make sense on a micro level, it does not magically transform into a different fundamental fact merely because there are greater degrees of separation.

That this is true leaves only one alternative, that each individual would be advantaged by ensuring that no other individual or entity has this power. The Fed may have the ability to create dollars at zero cost, but money still doesn\u2019t grow on trees. It is more likely that a particular form of money is not actually money than it is that money miraculously started growing on trees. And at an individual level, everyone is incentivized to ensure that is not the case. While there is a long habit of not thinking this particular thing wrong, the errant defense of custom can only stray so far. Time converts everyone back into reality.

All very valid questions, but none of these questions change the fact that many more dollars exist and that each dollar will be worth materially less in the future. That is intuitive. However, at an even more fundamental level, recognize that the operation of printing money (or creating digital dollars) does nothing to generate economic activity. To really simplify it, imagine a printing press just running on a loop. Or, imagine keying in an amount of dollars on a computer (which is technically all that the Fed does when it creates \u201cmoney\u201d). That very operation can definitionally do nothing to produce anything of value in the real world. Instead, that action can only induce an individual to take some other action."}

That time and value is ultimately what money tracks and prices. Entering a large number into the computer does not produce software, hardware, cars or homes.

Seems cryptic but it is not a suggestion that the individuals at the Fed are consciously or deliberately operating maliciously. It is just the root level consequence of the Fed\u2019s actions, even if well intentioned. Again, the Fed\u2019s operation (arbitrarily adding zeros to various bank account balances) cannot actually generate economic activity; all it can do is determine how to allocate new dollars. By doing so, it is advantaging some individual, enterprise or segment of the economy over another. In allocating new dollars that it creates, it is replacing a market function, one priced by billions of people, with a centralized function, greatly influencing the balance of power as to who controls the monetary capital that coordinates economic activity. Think about the distribution of money as the balance of control influencing and ultimately determining what gets built, by whom and at what price. At the moment of creation, there exists more money but there exists no more human time or goods and services as a consequence of that action. Similarly, over time, the Fed\u2019s actions do not create more jobs, there are just more dollars to distribute across the labor force, but with a different distribution of those holding the currency. The Fed can print money (technically, create digital dollars), but it can\u2019t print time nor can it do anything but artificially manipulate the allocation of resources within an economy."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-common-sense/", "title": "Bitcoin is Common Sense", "text": "Since 2007, the Fed balance sheet has increased seven-fold, but the labor force has only increased 6%.

Do not be confused by impossible-to-quantify theory concerning the idea of a job saved versus a job lost; this is the U.S. labor force, defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as all persons 16 years of age and older, both employed and unemployed. The inevitable result is that the value of each dollar declines, but it does not create more workers, and all prices do not adjust ratably to the increase in the money supply, including the price of labor."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-common-sense/", "title": "Bitcoin is Common Sense", "text": "In a theoretical world, if the Fed were to distribute the money in equal proportion to each individual that held the currency previously, it would not shift the balance of power. In practical application, the distribution of ownership shifts dramatically, heavily favoring the holders of financial assets (which is what the Fed buys in the process of creating new dollars) as well as those with cheap access to credit (the government, large corporations, high net-worth individuals, etc.). In aggregate, the purchasing power of every dollar declines, just not immediately, while a small subset benefits at the cost of the whole (see the Cantillon Effect). Despite the consequences, the Fed takes these actions in an attempt to support a credit system that would otherwise collapse without the supply of more dollars. In the Fed\u2019s economy, the credit system is the price setting mechanism as the amount of dollar-denominated debt far outstrips the supply of dollars, which is also why the purchasing power of each dollar does not immediately respond to the increase in the money supply."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-common-sense/", "title": "Bitcoin is Common Sense", "text": "Instead, the effects of increasing the money supply are transmitted, over time, through an expansion of the credit system. The credit system attempting to contract is the market and the individuals within an economy adjusting and re-pricing value; the Fed attempting to reverse that natural course by flooding the market with dollars is, by definition, overriding the market\u2019s price setting function, fundamentally altering the structure of the economy. The market solution to the problem is to reduce debt (expression of preference) and the Fed\u2019s solution is to increase the supply of dollars such that existing debt levels can be sustained. The goal is to stabilize the credit system such that it can then expand, and it is a redux to the 2008 financial crisis, which provides a historical roadmap. In the immediate aftermath of the prior crisis, the Fed created $1.3 trillion new dollars in a matter of months. Despite this, the dollar initially strengthened as deflationary pressures in the credit system overwhelmed the increase in the money supply, but then, as the credit system began to expand, the dollar\u2019s purchasing power resumed its gradual decline. At present, the cause and effect of the Fed\u2019s monetary stimulus is principally transmitted through the credit system. It was the case in the years following the 2008 crisis, and it will hold true this time so long as the credit system remains intact."}

More dollars result in each dollar becoming worth less, and the value of any good naturally trends toward its cost to produce. The marginal cost for the Fed to produce a dollar is zero. With all the bailouts from both the Fed and Congress, whether to individuals or companies, someone is paying for everything. It is axiomatic that printing money (or creating digital dollars) does nothing to generate economic activity; it only shifts the balance of powers as to who allocates the money and prices risk. It strips power from the people and centralizes it to the government. It also fundamentally impairs the economy\u2019s ability to function as it distorts prices everywhere. But most importantly, it puts the stability of the underlying currency at risk, which is the cost that everyone collectively pays. The Fed may be able to create dollars for free and the Treasury may be able to borrow at near-zero interest rates as a direct result, but there is still no such thing as a free lunch. Someone still has to do the work, and all printing money does is shift who has the dollars to coordinate and price that work."}

In addition, the Fed established a facility to issue asset backed securities to purchase student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, etc. All of this without a price tag, and just a promise to do whatever it takes. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so serious, but the real question is, if the Fed were in control, why was it so reactionary? Why did its plans change so drastically in a ten-day period if it ever understood the extent of the issue? Never mind the unintended consequences, it is merely a demonstration that the Fed is not in control. Why would it have announced a $700 billion program if it didn\u2019t expect it to work? It\u2019s a classic game of guess and check, except the consequences can never be checked (only the immediate market reactions). The problem is our economy is at stake."}

There is no reason even a few-month, complete economic shutdown should put the world on the brink of a global depression. Instead, it is the output of an inherently fragile financial system, one dependent on perpetual credit expansion necessary to sustain itself and without which it would begin to collapse. It is the fragility of the global financial system itself that is the problem, not a global pandemic. Do not be fooled. This isn\u2019t a pandemic induced failure of the financial system.

This market setup is a function of central banks everywhere. The instability is not by design but the market structure is. In response to every economic slow down (or crisis) which has appeared over the last four decades, central banks (including the Fed) have responded by increasing the money supply and reducing interest rates, such that existing debt levels could be sustained and such that more credit could be created. Every time the system as a whole attempted to deleverage, central banks worked to prevent it through monetary stimulus, ultimately kicking the can down the road and allowing decades of economic imbalance to accumulate in the credit system. This is the root cause of the inherent fragility in the financial system (see here). And it is why each time an economic disruption surfaces, the monetary response from central banks need be larger and more extreme. With greater imbalance comes the need for a bigger boat."}

It does so by distributing knowledge through its pricing mechanism, the single most important market signal (in aggregate) which facilitates economic coordination and the allocation of resources. However, as the freedoms afforded by one monetary medium become impaired, it should be no surprise that human ingenuity would find a way to route around and spawn a new creation that performs that same function more effectively.

Individuals adopt bitcoin because it possesses unique properties that make it superior as a form of money relative to all other currencies.

Some not-so-rigorous thinkers suggest that money is either a collective hallucination or that it derives value from the government. In reality, money is a tool that was invented by man to satisfy a very specific market need in facilitating trade. Money helps facilitate this activity by acting as an intermediary between a series of present and future exchanges. Without any conscious control or direction, market participants evaluate various different goods and converge on the tool with the properties best-suited to facilitate the very express purpose of converting present value for future value. Whereas individual consumption preferences vary from person to person and change constantly, the need for exchange is practically universal, and the function is distinctly uniform. For every individual, money allows for value produced in the present to be converted into consumption in the future. The value one places on a home, a car, food, leisure, etc. naturally changes over time and logically varies from person to person. But the need to consume and the need to communicate preferences does not change and applies to all individuals on an intersubjective basis."}

It aggregates and measures the preferences of all individuals within an economy, at any point in time, and it would not be possible, or at the very least extremely inefficient, to communicate value if not for a common constant upon which everyone could agree. Think of money as the constant against which to measure all other goods. If it did not exist, everyone would be at a practical standstill, not able to agree on the value of anything. By comparing against a single constant, it then becomes more practical to discern the relative value of two other goods. There are billions of goods and services produced by billions of individuals, all with unique preferences. Through the convergence on a single form of money to aggregate and communicate all preferences, a price system ultimately emerges. By measuring and expressing the value of all goods in a common intermediary (money), it then becomes possible to understand how much one good (or resource) is valued relative to any other."}

In fact, it is a price system that allows supply and demand structures to form, and it is ultimately a necessity because it provides for the communication of information, without which the fulfillment of basic needs would not be possible. Imagine if nothing you consumed had a discernible price. How would you know what you needed to produce in order to obtain the goods you prefer? Then recognize that your own conception of the value you produce and the very existence of goods and services produced by others would not be available if not for some expression of price existing. It becomes circular, but money is the good that allows the underlying structures of an economy to form through the price system.

By using money to coordinate the production of goods and services and by selling the output for more money (profit). In essence, companies compete for the same pool of money in order to accumulate capital. Money is the tool that makes the wheel go round.

One will preserve future purchasing power better than the other. Everyone intuitively understands this and makes a decision based on the inherent properties of one medium relative to another. When deciding which monetary good to use, the preference of one individual is impacted by the preference of others, but each individual is making an independent evaluation discerning the relative strengths of multiple monetary goods.

It provides the common language to communicate value, ultimately leading to trade and specialization, and organically creating the ability to expand the use of resources beyond the reach of \u201cconscious control\u201d (to steal Hayek). When contemplating the network effects of a social network, a logistics network, a telecom network, energy grid etc., add them all together and that is the value of a monetary network. A monetary network not only provides the foundation for all other value networks to form, but the currency of that network is what pays for access to all derivative networks within the monetary network. The existence of the common currency is the engine and the oil."}

None would subsist without the forces of government intervention; nor would any fiat currency have ever emerged if not for the prior existence (and limitations) of gold as a monetary medium. Modern monetary theorists and gold bugs alike will never admit it, but the calamity that is all fiat systems is nothing more than the manifestation of gold\u2019s failure as a monetary medium. It is a dead man walking. The gold standard was formally abandoned in 1971, and the subsistence of jurisdictional fiat systems since then merely represents a transient departure from free market monetary forces. Modern fiat systems have only managed to survive as long as they have because a solution to the very problem created by fiat did not yet exist. Bitcoin is that solution, and ever since its creation, individuals have been converging upon it as a new monetary standard; a trend that will only continue as knowledge naturally distributes."}

Bitcoin has an optimal monetary policy, and that policy is credibly enforced on a decentralized basis. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, and the element of trust is removed from the equation entirely. Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply is enforced by a network consensus mechanism on a decentralized basis. No one trusts anyone, and everyone enforces the rules independently. As an aggregate of these two functions, bitcoin is becoming the scarcest form of money that has ever existed. Finite scarcity is a property no other form of money has ever or will ever achieve, and demand for bitcoin is fundamentally driven by that scarcity. However, scarcity is a two-sided equation. A fixed supply may be the primary draw, but demand is a critical and often overlooked aspect of scarcity. Demand is what actually makes scarcity a utility as a constant in exchange. Bitcoin becomes more and more scarce as a two-way function of increasing demand and a completely inelastic terminal supply. The scarcity of its fixed supply creates demand but increasing demand then creates greater scarcity. It sounds circular because it is. If there were 21 million bitcoin and only 1 person valued it, there would be nothing scarce or useful about bitcoin. But if 100 million people valued bitcoin, 21 million starts to become scarce. And if the network grew to one billion people, 21 million would become extremely scarce, and bitcoin would represent a greater utility as a constant."}

It becomes a greater utility because more people are communicating in the same language of value through a more reliable constant. And as more individuals participate in the network consensus mechanism, the entire system becomes more resistant to corruption and ultimately more secure. Recognize that there is nothing about a blockchain that guarantees a fixed supply, and bitcoin\u2019s supply schedule is not credible because software dictates it be so. Instead, 21 million is only credible because it is governed on a decentralized basis and by an ever increasing number of network participants. 21 million becomes a more credibly fixed number as more individuals participate in consensus, and it ultimately becomes a more reliable constant as each individual controls a smaller and smaller share of the network over time.

Centralization inherently creates the need to rely on trust, and trust ultimately puts the supply of any currency at risk, which in turn impairs demand and marginalizes its utility in the function of exchange. Whereas all other currencies depend on trust, the constant bitcoin provides is trustless. 21 million is only credible because bitcoin is decentralized, and bitcoin becomes increasingly decentralized over time. The best any other form of money could possibly do is match bitcoin, but practically, it is not possible because individuals converge on a single medium, and bitcoin beat every other currency to the punch.

If the primary (or sole) utility of an asset is the exchange for other goods and services, and if it does not have a claim on the income stream of a productive asset (such as a stock or bond), it must compete as a form of money. As a consequence, any such asset is directly competing with bitcoin for the exact same use case, and no other currency will ever provide a more reliable constant because bitcoin already exists and it is finite. Because individuals converge on a single medium, scarcity in bitcoin will perpetually be reinforced on both the supply and demand side, whereas the opposite force will be in effect for all other currencies due to the reflexive nature of monetary competition. The distinction between two monetary goods is never marginal, and neither is the consequence of individual decisions to exchange in one medium rather than another. Money is an intersubjective problem, and a choice to opt into one monetary medium is an explicit opt out of the other, which in turn causes one network to gain value (and utility) at the direct expense of another. As bitcoin becomes more scarce and more reliable as a constant, other currencies become less scarce and more variable. Monetary competition is zero sum, and relative scarcity, a dynamic function of both supply and demand, creates the fundamental differentiation between two monetary mediums that only increases and becomes more apparent over time."}

Receive bitcoin for value produced today, save, spend bitcoin in the future in return for value produced by others. It will perform the same function regardless of amount. The practical consequence of divisibility is that bitcoin is capable of measuring any and all value which allows it to support any and all adoption. Individuals produce a wide range of value, and divisibility allows all individuals to utilize bitcoin as a savings mechanism regardless of whether it be to store $50 or $50,000 in value. For a monetary good to be an effective communication tool, it must be able to measure the range of value produced by all individuals, and bitcoin does this flawlessly.

Each individual owns a smaller and smaller nominal amount of the currency, but the purchasing power of each equivalent unit increases over time. With each exchange, every individual is conveying his or her own value onto the network and is doing so at the direct expense of a competing monetary network.

The consequence is that a smaller and smaller denomination of bitcoin can be used by more people to transfer an equivalent amount of value, and as bitcoin is measured by more people, its ability to measure relative value only increases. Since bitcoin can measure all value and can be adopted by a limitless number of individuals, it practically obsoletes the need for any other value transfer network over the long-term because the form of money with the lowest rate of change ultimately communicates more perfect information.

Try to identify a single other good that could possibly share these properties: finite scarcity (greatest constant) + divisibility and fungibility (measurement) + ability to send over a communication channel (ease of transfer). This is what every other monetary good is up against as it competes for the convergent role of money. Practically, the only way to really appreciate the power of such a rare dynamic is through experiencing it firsthand. Any individual can access the network on a permissionless basis by running a bitcoin node on a home computer. The ability to power up a computer anywhere in the world and transfer a finitely scarce resource to any other individual, without permission or reliance on a trusted third-party is empowering.

Without doubt, bitcoin is definitely used by the likes of drug dealers and nefarious characters on the dark web. However, it would be irrational to believe that is its primary use or to believe bitcoin should be banned because of it.

But then again, criminals also use all of the above not to commit crimes as well. And that is where the logic that bitcoin must be banned because it enables criminal activity completely breaks down. Crimes are crimes. There is nothing inherent about the tools used to facilitate crimes that makes them criminal in themselves. Using the mail to send a letter to mom is not a crime. But using the mail to send drugs is mail fraud. Similarly, using the dollar to purchase flowers for mom, perfectly fine. But buying narcotics with dollars (or bitcoin), that\u2019s crime. Despite criminal use, no one is calling for the ban of roads, the internet, mail, etc. And you definitely do not see any prominent defenders of the public interest calling for a ban of the dollar, which just happens to be the preferred funding currency of criminals everywhere.

Whether a company or individual is willing to accept bitcoin from an address sanctioned by OFAC, or whether a third-party financial institution freezes an account associated with such an address is of little consequence to the long-term viability of bitcoin. What is consequential is whether the network would validate a transaction originated from a sanctioned address or validate a block that includes such a transaction. Stated another way, whether bitcoin miners or nodes would reject such a transaction despite it otherwise being valid based on the network\u2019s consensus rules. Bitcoin is only viable as a currency because it is decentralized. But decentralization is not an end in itself. The end game is censorship-resistance. And it is not an end game to protect criminals. It is an end game to protect the very root level functioning of the currency system."}

Most important of these rules is the finite scarcity of the currency itself. Censorship-resistance reinforces scarcity and scarcity reinforces censorship-resistance. Bitcoin becomes more resistant to censorship as it scales because the network becomes more decentralized over time. As adoption increases, each individual (on average) controls an ever-diminishing share of the network\u2019s fixed supply, and it is the scarcity of the currency which primarily drives adoption. As the network becomes further decentralized, it becomes increasingly difficult for any individual or business to censor the network. However, at any point in time, whether bitcoin is sufficiently censorship-resistant is ultimately unknown and practically unknowable. Instead, censorship-resistance can only be measured through the test of time and through each failed attempt to censor the network."}

By design, anyone can access the bitcoin network on a permissionless basis by running a bitcoin full node. Each node can broadcast transactions to the rest of the network, and every node validates a full history of the blockchain with each passing block based on a common set of rules. Through this operation, nodes distributed throughout the world are able to come to a common consensus regarding the valid state of bitcoin ownership across the network, on a decentralized basis and without anyone trusting any other participant. The consensus rules of bitcoin are the common language that coordinate all peers within the network, but no single party dictates the rules; everyone opts in voluntarily. If it were possible for any single party or central authority(s) to force a change on to the network or to influence activity within the network in such a way that would invalidate an otherwise valid transaction, it would demonstrate that the network was not sufficiently decentralized to prevent censorship."}

If it were possible to censor criminal-related activity within the network, either by inhibiting access to the network or by preventing otherwise valid transactions from being confirmed, it would demonstrate that the network is not sufficiently decentralized to ensure censorship-resistance. The bitcoin network has no understanding of criminality or who defines it. It is amoral and apolitical. All bitcoin understands (when validating transactions) is its consensus rules; it is a closed loop system. A bitcoin transaction is valid if it is consistent with the network\u2019s consensus rules; if it were not, all bets would be off. If criminal activity could be censored, it simply would prove that any activity could be censored. But that is not where it ends. If any activity within the network could be censored, the network as a whole would be censorable. By demonstrating that a single transaction could be prevented or censored, it would establish that the network\u2019s consensus rules would also be at risk."}

That number and the reliability of its scarcity underpins every other economic incentive that allows the bitcoin network to function and accumulate value, including the mechanism by which the network comes to consensus. Accepting that the bitcoin network will always to some extent be used for illicit purposes is not some libertarian bent. Instead, it is a recognition that in order for bitcoin to be functional and viable as a currency system, it has to be so for everyone. If anyone could prevent anyone else from utilizing the network, whether an individual, an organization or a nation-state, bitcoin would be at risk of failure. Censorship within bitcoin at the protocol layer is not the equivalent of PayPal de-platforming an individual or company; nor is it the equivalent of Bank of America shutting down a checking account or Visa not authorizing a transaction. Bitcoin is a currency issuer and settlement layer. Any effective form of censorship would undermine the system as a whole, which is why the activity most susceptible to censorship forms a litmus test for the rest of the network. If it were not possible to censor the most at-risk activity, it reinforces that bitcoin reliably works in all cases."}

And as an extension of an idea discussed in \u201cBitcoin Cannot Be Banned\u201d, anyone who calls for a ban on bitcoin due to the belief that it enables criminal activity is concurrently admitting that bitcoin is functional as a currency. Consequently, if bitcoin is functional in facilitating commerce associated with illicit activities, and despite the best efforts of a powerful regulatory authority, ipso facto, it can be functional in facilitating any other form of commerce as well, including by law abiding citizens. Practically, operating within that reality and recognizing that bitcoin is a finitely scarce resource, it does not logically follow that it will be confined to the dark web, nor is it today."}

And calling for a ban on bitcoin is somewhat like being scared of your own shadow. Not only would it not be practical to enforce, but the activity such a policy would seek to prevent is enabled today in far greater proportions by the dollar. It would be analogous to throwing the baby out with the bath water. We accept the good with the bad, recognizing that due to the very nature of bitcoin, we do not get to decide. There are always trade-offs, and in this case, that bitcoin will unavoidably be used for illicit purposes is the trade-off we gladly accept in exchange for the economic stability that an unmanipulatable global currency will provide. As with every technology, value will accrue to those that utilize bitcoin in its highest and best use, a function which only the market can determine.

Think about the claim that governments will ban bitcoin as conditional logic. Is bitcoin functional as money? If not, governments have nothing to ban.

Often extolled as a crash by skeptics, bitcoin fails to die and in each instance, it finds support at levels higher than prior adoption waves. The tulip narrative becomes tired and the skeptics move on to more nuanced issues, re-anchoring the debate. Stage two of grief follows: bitcoin is flawed as a currency. It is too volatile to be money, or it is too slow to be a payments system, or it cannot scale to satisfy all the payments in the world, or it wastes energy. The list goes on.

More and more people figure out why there is fundamental demand for bitcoin and why/how it works. This is what creates long-term demand for bitcoin. As more people increasingly demand it as a store of wealth, there is no supply response. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. No matter how many people demand bitcoin, the supply side is completely fixed and inelastic. As the skeptics continue to shout the same tired lines, the crowd continues to parse the noise and demand bitcoin due to the strengths of its monetary properties.

It actually increased in value relative to the dollar, and just thirty years later, the ban was lifted. Not only does bitcoin provide a greater value proposition relative to any other good that any government has ever attempted to ban (including gold); but by its nature, it is also far harder to ban. Bitcoin is global and decentralized. It is without borders and it is secured by nodes and cryptographic keys. The act of banning bitcoin would require preventing open source software code from being run and preventing digital signatures (created by cryptographic keys) from being broadcast on the internet. And it would have to be coordinated across numerous jurisdictions, except there is no way to know where the keys actually reside or to prevent more nodes from popping up in different jurisdictions.

The self-interests of millions, if not billions, of uncoordinated individuals aligned by their individual and collective need for money incentivizes permissionless innovation on top of bitcoin. Today, it may seem like a cool new technology or a nice-to-have portfolio investment, but even if most people do not yet recognize it, bitcoin is a necessity. It is a necessity because money is a necessity, and legacy currencies are fundamentally broken. Two months ago, the repo markets in the U.S. broke, and the Fed quickly responded by increasing the supply of dollars by $250 billion, with more to come. It is precisely why bitcoin is a necessity, not a luxury.

While the monoculture that is modern mainstream academia disagrees with this view, a fixed supply currency is superior to a currency that increases in supply over time (and at unpredictable rates). In any economy, supply and demand for goods and services relative to the supply and demand of money dictates prices. Price is what ultimately coordinates economic activity, and money is the foundation of the pricing mechanism within an economy. A currency with a fixed supply would remove the noise created by changes to the money supply in the price system, thus creating more reliable market signals. Because a monetary good facilitates the exchange between goods used for the purpose of either consumption or production, the form of money with the lowest rate of change will most accurately reflect changes in supply and demand of all other goods. Essentially, money is used to communicate the relative value of other goods and services, and changes in the money supply distort the communication of this information by introducing an extraneous variable to the equation."}

The information communicated through a monetary medium is that an iPhone costs approximately 20 times more than a barrel of oil. Money communicates opportunity cost (economic trade-offs) through its price system, and the more constant the quantity of money (lower rate of change), the more reliable the communication of information and economic trade-offs. If the money supply increased by 10% and prices adjusted equally, an iPhone would cost $1,100 and a barrel oil would cost $55. An iPhone would still cost 20 times more than a barrel of oil, and that is the relevant information which all market participants rely upon. In the real world, the problem is that prices do not adjust equally as the money supply changes. Instead, price signals become distorted. In a world with a constant money supply, changes in price would more accurately reflect changes in supply and demand in underlying markets for goods and services rather than also reflecting the unequal impact of a changing money supply. Changes in the money supply create noise extraneous to the underlying economic activity. Price coordinates economic trade-offs, and the reliability of a pricing system is dependent on the stability of the form of money used to communicate information."}

The market structure for money is different than that of all other goods. A consumption good is consumed and a production good is ultimately consumed in the production of other consumption goods. Whereas, the utility of money is in exchange; it is functional in the coordination of trade by and between consumption and production goods, rather than being consumed itself. Because the utility of money is in exchange, scarcity is more important than the nominal amount of money in an economy. As demand for money increases and as its price rises, there is not a commensurate supply response because of natural supply constraints. The same is not true for any individual good or service. The relative supply constraint of money is what allows it to communicate relative value between other goods and services. Consumption goods and production goods can be substituted for each other, but money facilitates virtually all exchange between all other goods. The value of a money may fluctuate relative to goods and services but relative scarcity of a money supply allows price to be communicated in terms of the money itself."}

The purchasing power of money would communicate far more perfect information through this pricing mechanism than if the supply of the money itself were changing. By creating one constant, everything else can be more reliably measured. And the desired information is not the absolute value of any one good. All value is subjective. Instead, the critical information communicated through a pricing mechanism is the relative value (or relative price) of many goods to each other.

This is core to the central banking monetary model, and it derives from monetarist economic theory which argues that an active management of the money supply stimulates aggregate demand and ultimately promotes full employment. What it technically does is manipulate interest rates downward by increasing the supply of money. Lower interest rates increase the willingness and incentive to borrow; however, all else being equal, a lower interest would otherwise decrease the willingness to lend. Essentially, by inflating the money supply, the central bank artificially manipulates the function of credit, creating a sustained imbalance between the incentive to borrow and the willingness to lend. The more pervasive consequence is the distortion of the pricing mechanism that coordinates economic activity. By manipulating the supply of money and the supply of credit, central banks distort all prices throughout the market. False signals (and bad information) are distributed to all market participants."}

The quantity and rate of change is unknown to most market participants. Instead, market participants react to price signals; that is how information is communicated. A price signal may be the cost of a good at the supermarket or it may be a salary an employer is willing to pay for a certain job. The change in the money supply creates a distortion of prices such that market participants cannot effectively understand whether changes in price are driven by changes in underlying supply and demand structures, or to what extent changes in price are merely a function of more or less money in the system.

Most people recall that prior to the financial crisis there was a housing bubble. By directly purchasing mortgages and by inflating the money supply, the Fed manipulated interest rates lower. Housing relies heavily on the supply of credit and ultimately on the cost of interest. With lower interest rates and more money available to lend, housing prices were manipulated higher. As a result, distorted price signals were sent to both buyers and sellers. Developers of housing respond by building more homes (increasing supply) and buyers of homes believe they can take on more debt at lower rates to purchase homes. More resources in the economy are devoted to the function of housing because of higher price levels. However, any increase in demand can only be sustained so long as the cost of credit is continually manipulated downward as a function of an increasing money supply."}

Credit expansion is the Fed\u2019s objective in stimulating growth, and net new credit cannot be created unless existing debt levels can be sustained, which is why the Fed must inflate asset prices to achieve its objectives. Asset prices support existing debt levels. When everyone figures out that the price signals are unsustainable and unreliable, it causes a shock to the system.

In the case of the housing example, supply (both of goods and labor) significantly exceeds sustainable demand at current price levels. More broadly, imbalances are everywhere.

Following the crisis, the Fed responded by pursuing the same policy action it had pursued for decades but on a much greater scale; it massively increased the money supply, further manipulating price signals. When the money supply is manipulated, recognize that not all price levels respond ratably. Money enters the system through different channels and the expansion of credit impacts certain segment of the economy more than others. All prices are manipulated, but not equally. It is fundamentally the distortion of relative prices which disrupt the underlying supply and demand function of a market. Price communicates information. It is how market participants communicate what they value on a relative basis. And, it is how all market participants then respond to those preferences on the supply side: what skills people train themselves with, what businesses people choose to build, what employment opportunities people seek.

More mining results in greater levels of network security, rather than increasing the rate of issuance or increasing the total amount of bitcoin that will ultimately be issued.

In aggregate, approximately $700 billion in base money was removed over the course of approximately two years.

It is backed by the only thing that backs any form of money: the credibility of its monetary properties. Money is not a collective hallucination nor merely a belief system. Over the course of history, various mediums have emerged as money, and each time, it has not just been by coincidence. Goods that emerge as money possess unique properties that differentiate them from other market goods. While The Bitcoin Standard provides a more full discussion, monetary goods possess unique properties that make them particularly useful as a means of exchange; these properties include scarcity, durability, divisibility, fungibility and portability, among others. With each emergent money, inherent properties of one medium improve upon and obsolete the monetary properties inherent in a pre-existing form of money, and every time a good has monetized, another has demonetized. Essentially, the relative strengths of one monetary medium out-compete that of another, and bitcoin is no different. It represents a technological advancement in the global competition for money; it is the superior successor to gold and the fiat money systems that leveraged gold\u2019s monetary properties."}

Bitcoin is finitely scarce, and it is more easily divisible and more easily transferable than its incumbent competitors. It is also more decentralized, and as a derivative, more resistant to censorship or corruption. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and each bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal points (1 one-hundred millionth). Value can be transferred to anyone and anywhere in the world on a permissionless basis, and final settlement does not rely on any third-party. In aggregate, its monetary properties are vastly superior to any other form of money used today. And, these properties do not exist by chance, nor do they exist in a vacuum. The emergent monetary properties in bitcoin are secured and reinforced through a combination of cryptography, a network of decentralized nodes enforcing a common set of consensus rules, and a robust mining network ensuring the integrity and immutability of bitcoin\u2019s transaction ledger. The currency itself is the keystone which binds the system together, creating economic incentives that allow the security columns to function as a whole. But even still, bitcoin\u2019s monetary properties are not absolute; instead, these properties are evaluated by the market relative to the properties inherent in other monetary systems."}

All that changes is the relative preference of holding one currency versus another. As the value of bitcoin rises, it is an indication that market participants increasingly prefer holding bitcoin over dollars. A higher price of bitcoin (in dollar terms) means more dollars must be sold to acquire an equivalent amount of bitcoin. In aggregate, it is an evaluation by the market of the relative strength of monetary properties. Price is the output. Monetary properties are the input. As individuals evaluate the monetary properties of bitcoin, the natural question becomes: which possesses more credible monetary properties? Bitcoin or the dollar? Well, what backs the dollar (or euro or yen, etc.) in the first place? When attempting to answer this question, the retort is most often that the dollar is backed by the government, the military (guys with guns), or taxes. However, the dollar is backed by none of these. Not the government, not the military and not taxes. Governments tax what is valuable; a good is not valuable because it is taxed. Similarly, militaries secure what is valuable, not the other way around. And a government cannot dictate the value of its currency; it can only dictate the supply of its currency."}

Each and every episode of hyperinflation should be evidence enough of the inherent flaws in fiat monetary systems, but unfortunately it is not. Rather than understanding hyperinflation as the logical end game of all fiat systems, most simply believe hyperinflation to be evidence of monetary mismanagement. This simplistic view ignores first principles, as well as the dynamics which ensure monetary debasement in fiat systems. While the dollar is structurally more resilient as the global reserve currency, the underpinning of all fiat money is functionally the same, and the dollar is merely the strongest of a weak lot.

It was also initially a system based on trust: accept dollars and trust that it could be converted back to gold at a fixed amount in the future.

Neither explanation has any basis in first principles, nor is it the fundamental reason why the dollar retains value. Instead, today, the dollar maintains its value as a function of debt and the relative scarcity of dollars to dollar-denominated debt. In the dollar world, everything is a function of the credit system. Nominal GDP is functionally dependent on the size, and growth of the credit system, and taxes are a derivative of nominal GDP. The mechanisms that fund the government (taxes and deficit spending) are both dependent on the credit system, and it is the credit system that allows the dollar to function in its current construct."}

If a government did not pay debt, basic government functions would be shut down due to lack of funding. In most cases, the consequence of not securing the future dollars necessary to repay debt means losing the shirt on your back. Debt creates the ultimate incentive to demand dollars.

In order to sustain the amount of debt in the system, the Fed has to systematically increase the supply of actual dollars, otherwise the credit system would collapse. Increasing the amount of base dollars has the immediate effect of deleveraging the credit system, but it has the longer-term effect of inducing more credit. It also has the effect of devaluing the dollar gradually over time. This is all by design.

While the digital dollar emerged from its paper predecessor and physical dollars remain in circulation, bitcoin is natively digital. With the dollar, there is a physical representation that anchors our mental models in the tangible world; with bitcoin, there is not.

Did gold emerge as money because it was physical or because it possessed transcendent properties beyond being physical? Of all the physical objects in the world, why gold? Gold emerged as money not because it was physical, but instead because its aggregate properties were unique. Most importantly, gold is scarce, fungible and highly durable.

The rest of the network can verify that the holder of the private key produced a valid signature, without actually knowing any details of the private key itself. Public and private key pairs are the foundation of bitcoin. And ultimately, private keys are what control access rights to the economic value of the network."}

Either and each are secured and validated by the same mechanism and by the same rules. Everyone has equal rights. Regardless of the economic value, each bitcoin (and bitcoin address) is treated identically within the bitcoin network. If a valid signature is produced, the transaction is valid and it will be added to the blockchain (if a transaction fee is paid). If an invalid signature is produced, the network will reject it as invalid. It does not matter how powerful or how weak any particular participant may be. Bitcoin is apolitical. All it validates is keys and signatures. Someone with more bitcoin may be able to pay a higher fee to have a transaction prioritized, but all transactions are validated based on the same set of consensus rules. Miners prioritize transactions based on value and profitability, nothing else. If a transaction is equally valuable, it will be prioritized based on a time sequence. But importantly, the mining function, which clears transactions, is divorced from ownership. Bitcoin is not a democracy; ownership is controlled by keys and every bitcoin transaction is evaluated based on the same criteria within the network. It is either valid or it is not. And every bitcoin must have originated within a block consistent with the 21 million supply schedule in order to be valid."}

Bitcoin are extremely scarce, and private keys are the gatekeeper to the transfer of every bitcoin. The saying goes: not your keys, not your bitcoin. If a third-party party controls your keys, such as a bank, that entity is in control of your access to the bitcoin network, and it would be very easy to restrict access or seize funds in such a scenario. While many people choose to trust a bank-like entity, the security model of bitcoin is unique; not only can each user control their own private keys, but each user can also access the network on a permissionless basis and transfer funds to anyone anywhere in the world. This is only possible if a user is in control of a private key. In aggregate, users controlling private keys decentralize the control of the network\u2019s economic value, which increases the security of the network as a whole. The more distributed access is to the network, the more challenging it becomes to corrupt or co-opt the network. Separately, by holding a private key, it becomes extremely difficult for anyone to restrict access or seize funds held by any individual. Every bitcoin in circulation is secured by a private key; miners and nodes may enforce that 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, but the valid bitcoin that do exist are ultimately controlled and secured by a private key."}

If a miner attempts to compensate themselves in an amount inconsistent with bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply, the rest of the network will reject the miner\u2019s work as invalid. The supply of the currency is integrated into bitcoin\u2019s security model, and real world energy resources must be expended in order for miners to be compensated. Still yet, every node within the network validates the work performed by all miners, such that no one can cheat without a material risk of penalty.

Imagine a global economy where billions of people, disparately located throughout the world, can transact across one common decentralized network, and everyone can arrive at the same consensus of the ownership of the network, without the coordination of any central party. How valuable would that network be? Bitcoin is valuable because it is finite, and it is finite because it is valuable.

Before bitcoin, everyone was forced to opt in to this system by default. Now that bitcoin exists, there is a viable alternative. Each time the Fed returns with more quantitative easing to sustain the credit system, more and more individuals will discover that the monetary properties of bitcoin are vastly superior to the legacy system, whether the dollar, euro or yen.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "To start on this journey, first realize that bitcoin was created to specifically address a problem that exists with modern money. The founder of bitcoin set out to create a peer-to-peer digital cash system without the need for a trusted third-party, and a blockchain was one critical part of the solution. In practice, bitcoin (the currency) and its blockchain are interdependent. One does not exist without the other; bitcoin needs its blockchain to function and there would not be a functioning blockchain without a native currency (bitcoin) to properly incentivize resources to protect it. That native currency must be viable as a< form of money because it is exclusively what pays for security, and it must have credible monetary properties in order to be viable."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Without the money, there is no security and without the security, the value of the currency and the integrity of the chain both break down. It is for this reason that a blockchain is only useful within the application of money, and money does not magically grow on trees. Yep, it is that simple. A blockchain is only good for one thing, removing the need for a trusted third-party which only works in the context of money. A blockchain cannot enforce anything that exists outside the network. While a blockchain would seem to be able to track ownership outside the network, it can only enforce ownership of the currency that is native to its network. Bitcoin tracks ownership and enforces ownership. If a blockchain cannot do both, any records it keeps will be inherently insecure and ultimately subject to change. In this sense, immutability is not an inherent trait of a blockchain but instead, an emergent property. And if a blockchain is not immutable, its currency will never be viable as a form of money because transfer and final settlement will never be reliably possible. Without reliable final settlement, a monetary system is not functional and will not attract liquidity."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Ultimately, monetary systems converge on one medium because their utility is liquidity rather than consumption or production. And liquidity consolidates around the most secure, long-term store of value; it would be irrational to store wealth in a less secure, less liquid monetary network if a more secure, more liquid network existed as an attainable option. The aggregate implication is that only one blockchain is viable and ultimately necessary. Every other cryptocurrency is competing for the identical use case as bitcoin, that of money; some realize it while others do not but value continues to consolidate around bitcoin because it is the most secure blockchain by orders of magnitude and all are competing for the same use case. Understanding these concepts is fundamental to bitcoin and it also provides a basic foundation to then consider and evaluate the noise beyond bitcoin. With basic knowledge of how bitcoin actually works, it becomes clear why there is no blockchain without bitcoin."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Often, bitcoin\u2019s transaction ledger is thought of as a public blockchain that lives somewhere in the cloud like a digital public square where all transactions are aggregated. However, there is no central source of truth; there are no oracles and there is no central public blockchain to which everyone independently commits transactions. Instead, every participant within the network constructs and maintains its own independent version of the blockchain based on a common set of rules; no one trusts anyone and everyone validates everything. Everyone is able to come to the same version of the truth without having to trust any other party. This is core to how bitcoin solves the problem of removing third-party intermediaries from a digital cash system."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Every participant running a node within the bitcoin network independently verifies every transaction and every block; by doing so, each node aggregates its own independent version of the blockchain. Consensus is reached across the network because each node validates every transaction (and each block) based on a core set of rules (and the longest chain wins). If a node broadcasts a transaction or block that does not follow consensus rules, other nodes will reject it as invalid. It is through this function that bitcoin is able to dispose with the need for a central third-party; the network converges on the same consistent state of the chain without anyone trusting any other party. However, the currency plays an integral role in coordinating bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism and ordering blocks which ultimately represents bitcoin\u2019s full and valid transaction history (or its blockchain)."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Think of a block as a dataset that links the past to the present. Technically, individual blocks record changes to the overall state of bitcoin ownership within a given time interval. In aggregate, blocks record the entire history of bitcoin transactions as well as ownership of all bitcoin at any point in time. Only changes to the state are recorded in each passing block. How blocks are constructed, solved and validated is critical to the process of network consensus, and it also ensures that bitcoin maintains a fixed supply (21 million). Miners compete to construct and solve blocks that are then proposed to the rest of the network for acceptance. To simplify, think of the mining function as a continual process of validating history and clearing pending bitcoin transactions; with each block, miners add new transaction history to the blockchain and validate the entire history of the chain. It is through this process that miners secure the network; however, all network nodes then check the work performed by miners for validity, ensuring network consensus is enforced. More technically, miners construct blocks that represent data sets which include three critical elements (again simplifying):"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "To solve blocks, miners perform what is known as a proof of work function by expending energy resources. In order for blocks to be valid, all inputs must be valid and each block must satisfy the current network difficulty. To satisfy the network difficulty, a random value (referred to as a nonce) is added to each block and then the combined data set is run through bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic hashing algorithm (SHA-256); the resulting output (or hash) must achieve the network\u2019s difficulty in order to be valid. Think of this as a simple guess and check function, but probabilistically, trillions of random values must be guessed and checked in order to create a valid proof for each proposed block. The addition of a random nonce may seem extraneous. But, it is this function that forces miners to expend significant energy resources in order to solve a block, which ultimately makes the network more secure by making it extremely costly to attack."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Adding a random nonce to a proposed block, which is an otherwise static data set, causes each resulting output (or hash) to be unique; with each different nonce checked, the resulting output has an equally small chance of achieving the network difficulty (i.e. representing a valid proof). While it is often referred to as a highly complicated mathematical problem, in reality, it is difficult only because a valid proof requires guessing and checking trillions of possible solutions. There are no shortcuts; energy must be expended. A valid proof is easy to verify by other nodes but impossible to solve without expending massive amount of resources; as more mining resources are added to the network, the network difficulty increases, requiring more inputs to be checked and more energy resources to be expended to solve each block. Essentially, there is material cost to miners in solving blocks but all other nodes can then validate the work very easily at practically no cost."}

While there are a number of consensus rules, if any pending transaction in a block is invalid, the entire block is invalid. For a transaction to be valid, it must have originated from a previous, valid bitcoin block and it cannot be a duplicate of a previously spent transaction; separately, each block must build off the most up to date version of history in order to be valid and it must also include a valid coinbase transaction.

If miners include an invalid reward in a proposed block, the rest of the network will reject it as invalid which is the base mechanism that governs a capped total supply of 21 million bitcoin.

Within one integrated function, miners validate history, clear transactions and get paid for security on a trustless basis; the integrity of bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply is embedded in its security function, and because the rest of the network independently validates the work, consensus can be reached on a decentralized basis. If a miner completes valid work, it can rely on the fact that it will be paid on a trustless basis. Conversely, if a miner completes invalid work, the rest of the network enforces the rules, essentially withholding payment until valid work is completed. And supply of the currency is baked into validity; if a miner wants to be paid, it must also enforce the fixed supply of the currency, further aligning the entire network.

Essentially, as soon as a miner sees a new valid block proposed in the network, it must immediately begin to work on top of that block or risk falling behind and performing invalid work at a sunk cost.

The incentive to cooperate increases as it becomes more costly to produce work which would otherwise be considered invalid by the rest of the network.

Miners are merely paid to perform a service and the more miners there are, the greater the incentive to cooperate because the probability that a miner is penalized for invalid work increases as more competition exists. And recall that random nonce value; it seemed extraneous at the time but it is core to the function that requires energy resources be expended.

Bitcoin is a bearer asset, and it has no utility other than the exchange for other goods or services. It also has no claim on the income stream of a productive asset. As such, bitcoin is only valuable as a form of money and it only holds value because it has credible monetary properties (read The Bitcoin Standard, chapter 1). By definition, this is true of any blockchain; all any blockchain can offer in return for security is a monetary asset native to the network, without any enforceable claims outside the network, which is why a blockchain can only be useful in connection to the application of money. The chart below from The Bitcoin Standard articulates this point:"}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Without a native currency, a blockchain must rely on trust for security which eliminates the need for a blockchain in the first place.

In order to recoup that investment and a rate of return in the future, the payment in the form of bitcoin must more than offset the aggregate costs, otherwise the investments would not be made. Essentially, what the miners are paid to protect (bitcoin) must be a reliable form of money in order to incentivize security investments in the first place."}

The validity of the chain is ultimately what miners are paid to protect; if the network could not reasonably come to a consensus and if ownership were subject to change, no one could reasonably rely on bitcoin as a value transfer mechanism. The value of the currency ultimately protects the chain, and the immutability of the chain is foundational to the currency having value. It\u2019s an inherently self-reinforcing relationship."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-not-blockchain/", "title": "Bitcoin, Not Blockchain", "text": "Immutability is an emergent property in bitcoin, not a trait of a blockchain. A global, decentralized monetary network with no central authority could not function without an immutable ledger (i.e. if the history of the blockchain were insecure and subject to change).

As an example, consider a scenario in which one party purchased a car from another in return for bitcoin. Assume the title for the car transfers, and the individual that purchased the car takes physical possession. If bitcoin\u2019s record of ownership could easily be re-written or altered (i.e. changing the history of the blockchain), the party that originally transferred the bitcoin in return for the car could wind up in possession of both the bitcoin and the car, while the other party could end up with neither.

If bitcoin transfers could not reliably be considered final, it would be functionally impossible to ever trade anything of value in return for bitcoin. This is why the immutability of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is inextricably linked to the value of bitcoin as a currency. Final settlement in bitcoin is possible but only because its ledger is reliably immutable. And its ledger is only reliably immutable because its currency is valuable.

As bitcoin becomes more decentralized, it becomes increasingly difficult to alter the network\u2019s consensus rules and increasingly difficult to invalidate or prevent otherwise valid transactions (often referred to as censorship-resistance). As bitcoin proves to be increasingly censorship-resistant, confidence in the network grows, which fuels adoption, which further decentralizes the network, including its mining function. In essence, bitcoin becomes more decentralized and more censorship-resistant as it grows, which reinforces the immutability of its blockchain. It becomes increasingly difficult to change the history of the blockchain because each participant gradually represents a smaller and smaller share of the network; regardless of how concentrated ownership of the network and mining may be at any point in time, both decentralize over time so long as value increases, which causes bitcoin to become more and more immutable."}

Never seeming to find an answer but constantly in search of it; it is the perennial Jackson Hole dilemma. There is always much fanfare and this year was no different. The whole spectacle may have been highlighted by Lawrence Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and former President of Harvard University. In a 28-part twitter thread, Summers questioned a number of foundational assumptions made by the establishment economic mainstream, of which he is a resident member. In the game of Marco Polo, Summers is getting warmer but he\u2019s still on the wrong side of the pool. Identifying symptoms of the problem maybe, but as with most mainstream economists, the obvious question is never asked. Could the whole apparatus of central bank policy be the root cause of the problem rather than the ever-elusive solution?"}

Summers doubts that it can, but what if the better question were: is central banking the primary cause of macroeconomic instability? Since the financial crisis, quantitative easing has been the primary tool central banks have used in an attempt to stabilize the economy and to manufacture inflation. The playbook is as follows: increase the money supply, reduce interest rates and reflate asset values such that existing debt levels can be sustained and more debt can be created."}

When understanding its base operation, it becomes clear that quantitative easing has always been a fool\u2019s errand.

The mainstream policy position starts with the assumption that central banking is core to the function of an economy; then debate centers on what levers to pull and how best to manage the economy via central bank planning. Active management of the money supply via quantitative easing is taken as a given; it\u2019s a question of how much and when, rather than if."}

Ultimately, the economic debate played out over the course of the 20th century and ended with what has become the current mainstream position. The consequence has been an economic system that relies heavily on monetary debasement and credit creation, both of which are achieved through quantitative easing."}

For the last ten years, the bootstrapping upstart has been gaining ground on the incumbent system, as demonstrated by its adoption and steadily increasing value relative to other currencies. Opting in to bitcoin means opting out of quantitative easing, and while it may be a volatile path, the long-term trend will continue because central banks continue to pursue the very policy tool which bitcoin prevents."}

As Hayek describes in \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society\u201d, the price mechanism is the greatest distribution system of knowledge in the world. When the price mechanism becomes distorted, false signals are distributed throughout the economic system and the result is an imbalance between supply and demand which ultimately creates instability and fragility. Today, this instability has primarily been created and sustained as a function of quantitative easing. The financial crisis made it clear that the size of the credit system was both unstable and unsustainable; rather than allow the system to naturally deleverage, the Fed reflated asset prices and induced further credit expansion, such that existing debt levels could be sustained. Practically speaking, the central banking approach to solving a problem of too much debt was to induce the creation of even more debt, which was the original source of instability. Fortunately, bitcoin fixes this."}

The Fed digitally creates new digital dollars on a ledger (literally out of thin air) and uses those dollars to purchase financial assets, such as U.S. treasuries (government debt) or mortgage-backed securities. Following the financial crisis, the Fed introduced $3.6 trillion new dollars into the banking system via QE, quintupling the size of its balance sheet. As a net effect, more dollars exist within the banking system in the form of bank reserves and those reserves can then be used to lend or to purchase other assets. In simple terms, more dollars exist, which causes the value of each individual dollar to decrease."}

Said another way, quantitative easing is designed to allow banks to expand credit; for every dollar that is created through quantitative easing, the credit system can expand by multiples of each dollar added. This incremental credit (think auto loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.) is then used to purchase goods in the real economy, which causes the prices of goods to rise and the value of the dollar to decline on a relative basis."}

While many believe that quantitative easing was necessary, it merely kicked the can down the road and guaranteed more QE would be necessary in the future. The root cause of the crisis was a financial system that had become far too leveraged. At the time of the financial crisis, every dollar in the banking system had been leveraged and lent 150:1 (see Fed Z.1 & H.8 reports). There was too much debt and too few dollars, and the degree of leverage was only made possible as an indirect function of the Fed sustaining economic imbalances. With every recessionary business cycle in the decades leading up to the crisis, the Fed increased the supply of dollars to lower interest rates and to induce credit expansion. Rather than allow the system to course correct as a natural market function, the Fed\u2019s continual response was to reflate asset values by increasing the money supply such that existing debt levels could be sustained and more credit could be created."}

While it has pursued similar policies for decades, the financial crisis created an environment that triggered a more drastic response from the Fed. Practically speaking, the Fed needed a bigger boat and in response to the market turmoil, it increased the supply of dollars by $3.6 trillion in order to stave off an impending financial collapse. This time was different; while the subprime crisis steals the headlines, the real issue was the cumulative effect of sustained imbalances in the credit system which had accumulated over many cycles and the overall degree of system leverage."}

In order to reverse the impact, the Fed was forced to drastically increase the money supply (quantitative easing) in an effort to maintain the size of the credit system. Even after the height of the crisis, the Fed determined it was necessary to add trillions more in new dollars to continue to support a languishing system, despite acknowledging the limitations of its monetary policy tools.

This debt is stacked against only $1.7 trillion of actual dollars that exist within the banking system (Fed H.8 report). As a consequence, there remains far too much debt and too few dollars. Because QE induces the creation of trillions more in debt, it is more like heroin than an antibiotic; the more that is applied to a financial system, the more dependent on it that system becomes and the worse off when it is removed."}

While bitcoin would have presented a superior alternative even in the absence of quantitative easing, the global monetary debasement which occurred in response to the crisis sharpens the contrast. It is this contrast that makes the mere existence of bitcoin far more intuitive than it otherwise may be. Bitcoin literally exists because some highly intelligent individuals identified a problem and set the wheels in motion to create a solution.

It is through this reasoning that he explains why the dominant macroeconomic theory and monetary policy which guides central banks is inherently flawed. And, why the policy tools used by central banks, particularly quantitative easing, create more harm than good. I highly recommend reading the full speech as it provides the counter-narrative to the monoculture of today\u2019s economic policy making.

In the end, the ultimate negative impact to the economy is far greater than it otherwise would have been in the absence of central bank intervention. The financial crisis is patient zero and the quantitative easing response has only left us in a more precarious situation today.

It is also completely voluntary. If you like your financial system, you can keep it (for now at least). However, monetary systems tend to one medium so if a critical mass converge on bitcoin as the most credible long-term store of value, it may become less of a choice in the future. As individuals increasingly opt in to bitcoin, it will only make the issues present in the existing system more evident, which likely accelerates the need for quantitative easing. The greater the inclination to store wealth in bitcoin, the lower the demand to store wealth in the assets that support the existing credit system.

Approximately four years after that, 3.125 new bitcoin per block will be issued. This process will continue until we reach the smallest unit of bitcoin (1/100,000,000th) and thereafter no new bitcoin will be issued. This is the issuance function that governs bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply (21 million), and as a derivative function, it also shifts compensation to secure the network from (mostly) new bitcoin today to ultimately a system relying completely on transaction fees."}

If it were not for the scarcity of capacity in each bitcoin block, there would not be a mechanism to create a transaction fee market. Scarcity in block space creates competition between market participants to clear transactions which causes them to bid up the value of real estate and to use it efficiently. Without a fee market, the only mechanism to pay miners to secure the network would be to alter bitcoin\u2019s fixed monetary policy and increase supply. But recall that scarcity in bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply (21 million) is the basis of its store of value property, which is where the rubber meets the road. By creating scarcity in network capacity, we also ensure the integrity of bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply, which makes the whole value cycle function. Working within this reality, scarcity is a far more important property than either the speed or ultimate capacity of transaction throughput."}

What good is high transaction throughput and faster speeds if the fundamental value of the underlying currency is at risk? The existing financial system has already made the opposite trade-off for us. High transaction throughput and fast transactions by way of centralization but with the cost of an architecture susceptible to systemic monetary debasement.

Rather than clearing the currency through a central bank, final settlement of transactions would clear through the bitcoin network. In the existing architecture, the payments layer (Visa) and the settlement layer (banking network/central banks) are separate and distinct. The principal problem bitcoin intends to solve has little to do with the former, but instead, with the mechanism by which currency is issued and cleared (think the Fed and QE). Visa helps move dollars but Visa is not the dollar. It is a technology company that provides a service; it has 17,000 employees. Bitcoin has none."}

Instead, balances are checked, transactions are authorized and settlement occurs later. Dollars are not actually cleared through a central bank or settled at the point of sale every time a transaction is processed. Individual transactions are also never really cleared. Instead, transactions are batched together, netted and settled at a later point in time; only then are accounts credited with proper balances. So when someone attempts to equate a Visa transaction with final settlement, that is just not the way the world works.

Compare this to the existing permissioned financial system, which is subject to multiple layers of bank and central bank intermediaries and only open during \u201cbusiness\u201d hours. This is the great misnomer that exists within bitcoin. Those that believe bitcoin to be too slow or lacking in network capacity are comparing bitcoin to the wrong application.

Ultimately, this was gold\u2019s failure as a monetary medium. It was susceptible to centralization, which then spawned fiat currencies, which have turned out to be easily manipulable. While this is unlikely (and hopefully not) how bitcoin scales, money and payments technology are distinct problems. The fundamental reason being that there are two sides to every value transfer; one side almost always involving money and the other as the fulfillment of goods and services. Payments layers help provide a bridge."}

Two different processes, occurring at two different times. And, it is important to recognize that bitcoin has no knowledge of the outside world, whether identities or the second leg of a value transfer; all bitcoin knows how to do is issue and validate currency (whether a bitcoin is a bitcoin). This is really the function and limitation of any base currency system. Payments layers provide a bridge between currency settlement (the Fed or bitcoin) and the fulfillment of goods and services. Gold solved mass payments via bank centralization, the dollar, the Fed and large payments processors such as Visa. Bitcoin likely solves payments through a technologically superior mechanism, but we have time to solve what is a separate and distinct problem from that of money."}

Permissionless innovation and the economic incentives inherent in bitcoin will coordinate and accelerate solutions to any number of future challenges.

However, if successful, lightning will be used to create bitcoin payment channels that enable far greater transaction throughput at far lower cost, the scale and speed of which would rival Visa. While it may not be the ultimate solution, it is an example of the innovation that bitcoin is fostering.

Bitcoin volatility is one of these oft-criticized characteristics. A common refrain among skeptics, including central bankers, is that bitcoin is too volatile to be a store of value, medium of exchange or unit of account. Given its volatility, why would anyone hold bitcoin as a savings mechanism? And, how could bitcoin be effective as a transactional currency for payments if its value could reasonably drop tomorrow?"}

In the interim, volatility is the natural function of price discovery as bitcoin advances down the path of its monetization event and toward full adoption.

Education is such a critical aspect of bitcoin and I hope that, by distilling my own thoughts, I can help others accelerate their path in understanding a complex subject. I\u2019ve titled the series Gradually, Then Suddenly. As Hemingway penned the process of going bankrupt, it\u2019s also the way that government-backed currencies hyper-inflate and often how people come to understand bitcoin (gradually, then suddenly).Writings will generally stick to bitcoin but will also include the Fed and monetary economics as these stories are deeply intertwined. Because I\u2019ll be trying to keep concise, the series will communicate my principal conclusions and opinions rather than setting out to present every detail that led to them; my intention is to provide insight into my thought process and to provide a roadmap if others are interested in learning more. My hope is to reach a broader audience (beyond those that have been formative in my own journey) and to help folks on the periphery gain a better understanding of why many of us are so focused on bitcoin as a subject matter. Views presented are expressly my own and not those of either Unchained Capital or my colleagues. Hope you enjoy & please provide feedback."}

It was a slow process that involved unlocking a number of mental blocks along the way but it began with asking the question, what is money? That is the beginning of the real rabbit hole. And not the speculative, I\u2019m looking for a lottery ticket blockchain-is-going-to-change-the-world kind of rabbit hole. At the root level, it\u2019s the rabbit hole that attempts to answer the question, \u201cwhy is the dollar in my pocket money?\u201d Why do hundreds of millions of people exchange their hard-earned, real-world value every day for this piece of paper (or digital representation)? It\u2019s both a difficult question to ask and a harder one to answer, something I realized everyone has to approach in their own way, on their own timeline and guided by their own life experiences. People have to be interested in that question in order to even begin to understand bitcoin."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "For me, the path involved first understanding why gold was money. That involved understanding the unique properties which made something a better or worse form of money and what differentiated money as a unique economic good compared to most other types of economic goods. The Bitcoin Standard was formative for me in exploring the questions, not as a gospel but rather, as a foundation to think about the problem statement. When I applied that foundation to my own life experiences and to my own understanding of the existing financial system, and its flaws, only then did it begin to become intuitive. And that\u2019s something that may be evident (that bitcoin is intuitive as money) to those that have spent years thinking about it relative to monetary principles but it\u2019s also true that bitcoin is not intuitive. It\u2019s extremely not intuitive until it becomes intuitive and then over time it becomes hyper intuitive."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "As part of my process, I found it helpful to consider bitcoin relative to two tangible guide posts: gold and the dollar financial system. Does A (bitcoin) share the properties of B (either gold or the dollar, respectively). Is A better than B? Because what makes something money is not an absolutism; it is a choice between storing value in one medium vs. another, always involving trade-offs. Without understanding the flaws of the existing financial system (whether the dollar, euro, yen, bolivar, peso, etc., respectively), I could have never arrived at bitcoin being money in a vacuum."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "While I worked at Deutsche Bank during the financial crisis, I had no baseline to understand what was actually happening. Ten years later, and after having worked in the restructuring world and at a macro hedge fund, only then did I start to develop a more clear understanding of what had really transpired in 2008 and 2009. Through my own research of the great financial crisis, the Fed and specifically the impact of quantitative easing (see here), I came to the principal conclusion that the root problem was that the financial system had been leveraged approximately 150-to-1 (too much debt and too few dollars) and that the insane degree of leverage was only made possible as a function of Fed policy which had consistently prevented system-wide deleveraging over the course of the three decades leading up to the crisis. Further, it became apparent that the solution (quantitative easing) merely caused an unsustainable credit system to metastasize over the subsequent ten years, making future QE an inevitability. I became convinced that, whether bitcoin survives or not, the existing financial system is working on borrowed time and that one way or another, something other than the status quo will be the inevitable path forward."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "Then I figured out that bitcoin has a fixed supply. Developing an understanding of how and why that is possible is the basis of understanding bitcoin as money. Doing so requires significant personal investment in understanding how economic incentives are woven together with bitcoin\u2019s technical architecture and why bitcoin can\u2019t be \u201cfaked\u201d or copied (or rather, why the incentives are so strong to cooperate and why the opportunity cost is too high to defect). It\u2019s a long road but will ultimately lead one to an understanding that a global network of rational economic actors, operating within a voluntary, opt-in currency system would not collectively and overwhelmingly form a consensus to debase the currency which they have all independently and voluntarily determined to use as a store of wealth. This reality (or belief system) then underpins and reinforces bitcoin\u2019s economic incentives, technical architecture and network effect."}

That can\u2019t happen overnight for any individual. It can\u2019t be explained to someone at a cocktail party. It is a reality that is reinforced and strengthened over time only by experiencing the incentive structure and seeing it work time and time again, every 10 minutes (on average). When then compared to how the dollar system works or even the underpinnings of gold, bitcoin as money becomes more intuitive."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "In summary, when trying to understand bitcoin as money, start with gold, the dollar, the Fed, quantitative easing and why bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed. Money is not simply a collective hallucination or a belief system; there is rhyme and reason. Bitcoin exists as a solution to the money problem that is global QE and if you believe the deterioration of local currencies in Turkey, Argentina or Venezuela could never happen to the U.S. dollar or to a developed economy, we are merely at a different point on the same curve. Bitcoin represents a fundamentally different structure and a more resilient path forward but you have to understand where we\u2019ve been and how we got here to know where we\u2019re going."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/gradually-then-suddenly/", "title": "Gradually, Then Suddenly", "text": "Hayek writes about the price mechanism as the greatest distribution system of knowledge in the world (\u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society\u201d). When the money supply is manipulated, it distorts global pricing mechanisms which then communicates \u201cbad\u201d information throughout the economic system. When that manipulation is sustained over 30-40 years, massive imbalances in underlying economic activity are created which is where we find ourselves today. Ultimately, gold\u2019s failure was the dollar and the dollar\u2019s failure is the economic distortion which led to, and which has been exacerbated by, QE. Bitcoin\u2019s promise is the solution to both. Because bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed and cannot be manipulated, it will eventually become the most reliable pricing mechanism in the world and consequently, the greatest distribution system of knowledge. The volatility witnessed today is nothing more than the logical path of price discovery as adoption increases by orders of magnitude and as we advance toward that future state of full adoption."}

For example, getting a 20% discount on Amazon by spending Bitcoin through Purse. Additionally, consumers can buy things with Bitcoin that they cannot buy (easily) in any other way. Consider: An American can buy Persian rugs or Cuban cigars online despite trade embargoes. Bitcoin increases the efficiency of the economy, particularly in niche areas such as these."}

The decentralized, immutable transaction ledger also serves as a form of Triple Entry Bookkeeping, wherein Debits plus Credits plus the Network Confirmations of transactions increase trust and accountability across the system."}

It is fertile ground for the development of complicated algorithms, machine-to-machine payment protocols, smart contracts, and other tools. Its decentralized nature allows for innovation without permission. Altcoins (such as Litecoin and Ethereum) pose little threat as Bitcoin is already dominant as a store of value and as a medium of exchange in the cryptocurrency space. If you harbor doubts about the importance of this currency network effect \u2014 or worry about altcoins overtaking Bitcoin in some other way; I would point you to Daniel Krawisz with an insightful and thought-provoking article on the subject: \u201cThe Coming Demise of Altcoins\u201d. Ultimately, developers will continue to flock to Bitcoin."}

This process has already begun (consider NASDAQ's support of Open Assets/Colored Coins for the transfer of securities, NYSE's investment in Coinbase, etc.). Old money risks dying out lest it embrace new protocols such as Bitcoin."}

Network effects one through six culminate in this final network effect. Any newcomer in the realm of cryptocurrency or traditional currency, for that matter; would need to beat Bitcoin in all seven of these areas. This is unlikely considering the pace of development in Bitcoin Core, the level of investment in Bitcoin companies around the world, the growth in Bitcoin's user base, and on and on; Further price increases will only accelerate the process. Finally, a speculative attack could dramatically boost the value of Bitcoin almost overnight."}

The above-listed network effects can only serve to strengthen it. Competitors beware."}

Alternatively it may seem foolish to invest in a digital asset that isn\u2019t backed by any commodity or government and whose price rise has prompted some to compare it to the tulip mania or the dot-com bubble. Neither is true; the bullish case for Bitcoin is compelling but far from obvious. There are significant risks to investing in Bitcoin, but, as I will argue, there is still an immense opportunity."}

In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown, published a 9 page solution to a long-standing problem of computer science known as the Byzantine General\u2019s Problem. Nakamoto\u2019s solution and the system he built from it\u2014Bitcoin\u2014allowed, for the first time ever, value to be quickly transferred, at great distance, in a completely trustless way. The ramifications of the creation of Bitcoin are so profound for both economics and computer science that Nakamoto should rightly be the first person to qualify for both a Nobel prize in Economics and the Turing award."}

Unlike stocks, bonds, real-estate or even commodities such as oil and wheat, bitcoins cannot be valued using standard discounted cash flow analysis or by demand for their use in the production of higher order goods. Bitcoins fall into an entirely different category of goods, known as monetary goods, whose value is set game-theoretically. I.e., each market participant values the good based on their appraisal of whether and how much other participants will value it. To understand the game-theoretic nature of monetary goods, we need to explore the origins of money."}

The incredible inefficiencies inherent to barter trade drastically limited the scale and geographical scope at which trade could occur. A major disadvantage with barter based trade is the double coincidence of wants problem. An apple grower may desire trade with a fisherman, for example, but if the fisherman does not desire apples at the same moment, the trade will not take place. Over time humans evolved a desire to hold certain collectible items for their rarity and symbolic value (examples include shells, animal teeth and flint).

Trade and transfer of collectibles were quite infrequent in paleolithic societies, and these goods served more as a \u201cstore of value\u201d rather than the \u201cmedium of exchange\u201d role that we largely recognize modern money to play.

By correctly anticipating which objects might be demanded for their collectible value, a tremendous benefit was conferred on the possessor in their ability to complete trade and to acquire wealth. Some Native American tribes, such as the Narragansetts, specialized in the manufacture of otherwise useless collectibles simply for their value in trade. It is worth noting that the earlier the anticipation of future demand for a collectible good, the greater the advantage conferred to its possessor; it can be acquired more cheaply than when it is widely demanded and its trade value appreciates as the population which demands it expands. Furthermore, acquiring a good in hopes that it will be demanded as a future store of value hastens its adoption for that very purpose. This seeming circularity is actually a feedback loop that drives societies to quickly converge on a single store of value. In game-theoretic terms, this is known as a \u201cNash Equilibrium\u201d. Achieving a Nash Equilibrium for a store of value is a major boon to any society, as it greatly facilitates trade and the division of labor, paving the way for the advent of civilization."}

Merchants and traders would face a choice of whether to save the proceeds of their trade in the store of value of their own society or the store of value of the society they were trading with, or some balance of both. The benefit of maintaining savings in a foreign store of value was the enhanced ability to complete trade in the associated foreign society. Merchants holding savings in a foreign store of value also had an incentive to encourage its adoption within their own society, as this would increase the purchasing power of their savings. The benefits of an imported store of value accrued not only to the merchants doing the importing, but also to the societies themselves. Two societies converging on a single store of value would see a substantial decrease in the cost of completing trade with each other and an attendant increase in trade-based wealth. Indeed, the 19th century was the first time when most of the world converged on a single store of value\u2014gold\u2014and this period saw the greatest explosion of trade in the history of the world.

Gold coins that were used as money in antiquity still maintain significant value today. Fiat currency and bitcoins are fundamentally digital records that may take physical form (such as paper bills). Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered (since a tattered dollar bill may be exchanged for a new one), but the durability of the institution that issues them. In the case of fiat currencies, many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them. The Papiermark, Rentenmark and Reichsmark of the Weimar Republic no longer have value because the institution that issued them no longer exists. If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term\u2014the US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability. However, there are encouraging signs that, despite prominent instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks by hackers, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of \u201canti-fragility\u201d."}

Private keys representing hundreds of millions of dollars can be stored on a tiny USB drive and easily carried anywhere. Furthermore, equally valuable sums can be transmitted between people on opposite ends of the earth near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital are also highly portable. However, government regulations and capital controls mean that large transfers of value usually take days or may not be possible at all. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable. It is no wonder that the majority of bullion is never transported. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones. For instance, India\u2019s government, in an attempt to stamp out India\u2019s untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. The demonetization caused 500 and 1000 rupee notes to trade at a discount to their face value, making them no longer truly fungible with their lower denomination sibling notes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network. However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins.

For instance, an owner of 10 bitcoins would know that at most 2.1 million people on earth (less than 0.03% of the world\u2019s population) could ever have as many bitcoins as they had. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (examples include sea-floor or asteroid mining). Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nations-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems. The inflationary tendencies of governments across the world leave the owner of a fiat currency with the likelihood that their savings will diminish in value over time."}

The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that few states in history have been able to resist. If the 20th century, in which fiat monies came to dominate the global monetary order, established any economic truth, it is that fiat money cannot be trusted to maintain its value over the long or even medium term.

Many subsequently surmised, mistakenly, that the primary demand for bitcoins was due to their ostensible anonymity. Bitcoin, however, is far from an anonymous currency; every transaction transmitted on the Bitcoin network is forever recorded on a public blockchain. The historical record of transactions allows for later forensic analysis to identify the source of a flow of funds. It was such an analysis that led to the apprehending of a perpetrator of the infamous MtGox heist. While it is true that a sufficiently careful and diligent person can conceal their identity when using Bitcoin, this is not why Bitcoin was so popular for trading drugs. The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is \u201cpermissionless\u201d at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls. A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime. Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than Bitcoin.

The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article\u2019s writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion."}

If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately.

Keeping savings in the peso was equivalent to throwing away money. So people exchanged any pesos they wanted to save for dollars, which kept their value better than the peso.

A characteristic that is common to all monetary goods is that their purchasing power is higher than can be justified by their use-value alone. Indeed, many historical monies had no use-value at all. The difference between the purchasing power of a monetary good and the exchange-value it could command for its inherent usefulness can be thought of as a \u201cmonetary premium\u201d. As a monetary good transitions through the stages of monetization (listed in the section above), the monetary premium will increase. The premium does not, however, move in a straight, predictable line. A good X that was in the process of being monetized may be outcompeted by another good Y that is more suitable as money, and the monetary premium of X may drop or vanish entirely.

In the second hype cycle, rudimentary exchanges became available, but obtaining and securing bitcoins from these exchanges remained too complex for all but the most technologically savvy investors. Even in the third hype cycle, significant hurdles remained for investors transferring money to MtGox to acquire bitcoins. Banks were reluctant to deal with the exchange, and third party vendors who facilitated transfers were often incompetent, criminal, or both. Further, many who did manage to transfer money to MtGox ultimately faced loss of funds when the exchange was hacked and later closed."}

When no liquid goods are available or their supply is limited, a hyperinflating money collapses against real goods, such as real estate and commodities.

In the words of Michael Goldstein, \u201cSound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.\u201d If Bitcoin\u2019s governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. If Bitcoin\u2019s governance is flawed, Bitcoin\u2019s stakeholders should work to fix it."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Conversations regarding Bitcoin\u2019s governance tend to focus on who the decision makers ultimately are, perennial candidates include miners, nodes, and investors. The purpose and mechanics of governance are often just implied or even disconnected from reality. Views on the efficacy of past governance are often driven by who \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost\u201d a specific decision, rather than the adequacy of the decision making process itself."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Bitcoin governance is the process by which a set of transaction and block verification rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced, such that individuals adopt these rules for verifying that payments they received in transactions and blocks fit their subjective definition of \u201cBitcoin\u201d. If two or more individuals adopt the same set validation of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what \u201cBitcoin\u201d is."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "In the context of Bitcoin\u2019s governance, these two views mirror the classic divide between deontological and consequentialist ethics respectively. I favor Matt\u2019s deontological approach of focusing on trustlessness. Throughout monetary history, from ancient coin producers to modern central banks, trusting others to produce money has resulted in abuse of that trust. Compromising on trustlessness could help the Bitcoin price find a local maximum, at the expense of finding a much higher global maximum. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Bitcoin\u2019s price has been correlated with upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol. Perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental value is affected by upgrades, but Bitcoin is so illiquid and volatile that the price does not reliably reflect fundamental value. If we can\u2019t observe the consequences of an upgrade on Bitcoin\u2019s value, the consequentialist approach seems inadequate."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Before we can evaluate the current Bitcoin governance process against the stated goals of maintaining trustlessness or increasing the value of Bitcoin, we should attempt to define how the current Bitcoin governance process actually works."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "The Bitcoin governance process maintains a set of verification rules. At a high level, this long set of verification rules covers syntax, data structures, resource usage limits, sanity checks, time locking, reconciliation with the memory pool and main branch, the coinbase reward and fee calculation, and block header verification. Amending these rules without tradeoffs is no easy feat."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Most of these rules were inherited from Satoshi Nakamoto. Some have been added or amended to address bugs and denial-of-service vulnerabilities. Other rule changes occurred to enable innovative new projects. For example, the new Check Sequence Verify opcode was added to enable new scripts."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Every rule change begins with research. For example, SegWit began with research into fixing transaction malleability. Transaction malleability had become a serious issue because it prevented the Lightning Network from deploying on Bitcoin.

In this scenario, the researcher is at a disadvantage if they lack reputation and credibility."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Another problem at the implementation phase is that the maintainers of the reference implementation will not merge in an implementation if it is widely seen as contentious by the Bitcoin protocol developers and the wider Bitcoin community. The reference implementation\u2019s maintainers have a deliberate policy of following consensus changes rather than trying to impose them. The C++ reference implementation, hosted at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin, is the direct successor of Satoshi\u2019s codebase. It continues to be the most popular Bitcoin node implementation due to its maturity and reliability."}

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "A proposal to change validation rules can have a softfork or a hardfork implementation. Some proposals can only be implemented as a hardfork. From the perspective of pre-fork nodes, a softfork implementation is forward-compatible. With a softfork, the pre-fork nodes do not need to upgrade their software in order to continue validating the pre-fork consensus rules. However, these pre-fork nodes are not validating rule changes made by the soft-fork. From the perspective of pre-fork nodes, a hardfork is not forward-compatible. Pre-fork nodes will end up on a different network as post-fork nodes."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "There has been controversy about the effects of hard and softforks on the network and users. Softforks are seen as being safer than hardforks, because they do not require an explicit opt-in, but this can also be seen as coercive. Someone who disagrees with a softfork must hardfork to reverse it."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Once implemented in the node software, users must be persuaded to use the node software. Not all node users are equal in their importance. For example, \u201cblockchain explorers\u201d also have more power as many users rely on their node. Additionally, an exchange can determine which validation rule set belongs to which ticker symbol. Speculative traders, large holders, and other exchanges provide a check on this power over ticker symbols."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "While individual users may signal on social media that they are using a certain version of node software, this can be sybil attacked. The ultimate test of consensus is whether your node software can receive payments that you consider to be bitcoins, and you can send payments that your counter-parties\u2019 node software considers to be bitcoins."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Softforks have an on-chain governance feature called BIP-9 Version bits with timeout and delay. This feature measures miner support for softforks on a rolling basis. Miner support for proposals is used as a proxy measure for the wider community\u2019s support. Unfortunately this proxy measure can be inaccurate due to mining centralization and conflicts of interest between miners and users. On-chain \u201cvoting\u201d by miners also perpetuates the myth that Bitcoin is a miner democracy, and that the miners alone decide on transaction and block validity. BIP-9 is useful to the extent that we recognize and accept the limitations of proxy measurements."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "Changes to the validation rules are enforced by the decentralized p2p network of fully validating nodes. Nodes use the verification rules to independently verify that payments received by the node operator are in valid Bitcoin transactions and are included in valid Bitcoin blocks. Nodes will not propagate transactions and blocks which break the rules. In fact, nodes will disconnect and ban peers which are sending invalid transactions and blocks. As StopAndDecrypt put it, \u201cBitcoin is an impenetrable fortress of validation.\u201d If everyone determines that a mined block is invalid then the miner\u2019s coinbase reward + fees is worthless."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "The role of miners is to provide a time-stamping function secured with proof-of-work. The amount of hashrate provided is based on the cost of hardware and electricity on one hand, and revenue from the coinbase reward + fees on the other hand. Miners are mercenaries, and in the past they have provided their time-stamping function without full rule validation. Due to mining centralization, miners can not be trusted to enforce the validation rules on their own."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "In my opinion, the current Bitcoin governance model has prevented a degradation of trustlessness. The dramatic increase in on-chain Bitcoin transactions over the past 5 years seemed to have no end in sight. If Bitcoin\u2019s governance model had not been resistant to last year\u2019s miner signalling for a doubling the maximum block weight, a precedent would have been set of valuing transaction throughput above trustlessness."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-governance/", "title": "Bitcoin Governance", "text": "I think it\u2019s impossible to establish a causal relationship. The price is much higher than it was 2 years ago, but it seems to be an endogenous process driven by trader psychology, not technological fundamentals. Regarding fundamentals, it\u2019s undeniable that Bitcoin\u2019s governance has delivered on consensus changes which the Lightning Network depends on to operate. I\u2019ve been experimenting with establishing channels and making Lightning payments: there is no doubt in my mind that LN increases Bitcoin\u2019s value."}

With average transaction fees exceeding $2, the doom-mongers assure us Bitcoin is doomed, because nobody wants to pay $2 to make a payment, when credit cards, paypal, and many other options charge far less transaction costs."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "The problem here, as usual, is not with Bitcoin, but with people\u2019s misunderstanding of Bitcoin, and the first clue to that can be found in the sky-rocketing price: if Bitcoin is so doomed, why are people still buying it? The answer is that Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is not in making the small consumer purchases, but in making large and important payments, particularly across borders. Payments in person, for small amounts, can be conducted in a wide variety of options: physical cash, barter, favors, credit cards, bank checks, and so on. Payments across the world, however, are a very different story."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "There are only a few currencies that are accepted for payment worldwide, namely: the US Dollar, the Euro, gold, and the IMF\u2019s SDR\u2019s. The vast majority of international payments are denominated in one of these currencies, with only a tiny percentage shared by a few other major currencies. To send these currencies in values around thousands of dollars internationally costs dozens of dollars usually, and is subject to invasive forensic examination by financial institutions. Compared to these transactions, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees of $2.5 are still a bargain."}

Yet, that would also not spell doom for Bitcoin, because sending these individual payments is not the limit of Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "Bitcoin is money free of counter-party risk, and its network can offer final settlement of large volume payments within minutes. Bitcoin can thus best be compared to settlement payments between central banks and large financial institutions, and it compares favorably to them, being infinitely cheaper and more verifiable. The only other form of money in history which is free of counter-party risk is gold, and moving that around is incomparably more expensive."}

Bitcoin\u2019s current capacity is to verify around 350,000 transactions per day. This number of transactions can allow a global network of 850 banks to each have one daily transaction with every other bank on the network. (The number of unique connections in a network equals n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of nodes.)"}

Such a network would have two major advantages over the current network of central banks: First, the finality of settlement on Bitcoin does not rely on any counter-party, and does not require any single bank to be the de facto arbiter, making it ideal for a network of global peers, rather than a global hegemonic centralized order. Second, the Bitcoin network is based on a form of money whose supply cannot be inflated by any single member bank, making it a more attractive store of value proposition than national currencies whose creation was precisely so their supply can be increased to finance governments."}

Without a lender of last resort, fractional reserve banking becomes an extremely dangerous arrangement, and the only banks that\u2019ll survive in the long-run would be sound money banks offering financial instruments 100% backed by Bitcoin. They would settle payments between their own customers off of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, and then perform final daily settlement between each other over the blockchain."}

Sound money has been a necessary building block of human civilizations, and its demise has usually coincided with civilizational decline. The modern world was built in the 19th century on sound money, funded by investors with the low time preference engendered from a sound money. The consumerist culture of instant gratification of the twentieth century, on the other hand, was the culture of ever-devaluing fiat money, which discourages saving, and incentivizes short-term orientation."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "The obsession with consumer payments in the Bitcoin community is an unfortunate relic of the fiat money era. Generations that have only known monetary hot potatoes that need to be spent before they devalue have come to view life as a quest of mass consumption. In a world of sound money, people will still consume, of course, because they need to survive. But consumption will come at a high opportunity cost in the future, since savings appreciate. As result, consumption will stop being a compulsive part of life, and people will buy things they need, and things that last for a long time. Instead of wasting their money on plastic bullshit they don\u2019t need and expensive sugary addictions, people will save their money for the future, and watching it appreciate, achieve financial independence."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "The number of transactions in a Bitcoin economy can still be as large as it is today, but the settlement of these transactions will not happen on Bitcoin\u2019s ledger, whose immutability and trustlessness is far too valuable for individual consumer payments. The reality is that buying a coffee does not require the level of security and trustlessness that Bitcoin offers; it can be more than adequately handled on second layer solutions denominated in Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin for consumer purchases is akin to driving a Concorde jet down the street to pick up groceries: a ridiculously expensive waste of an astonishing tool. Consumer payments are a relatively trivial engineering problem which the modern banking system has largely solved with various forms of credit and debit arrangements. Whatever the limitations of current payment solutions, they will stand to benefit immensely from the introduction of free market competition into the field of banking and payments, the most sclerotic industry in the modern world economy, owing to its control by governments that can print the money on which it runs."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/", "title": "Economics of Bitcoin as a Settlement Network", "text": "If the consumer-payments view of Bitcoin were correct, the rise in transaction fees would hurt adoption of the network, leading to stalling in the price, or a drop, as the network is relegated to the status of a curiosity. On a day in which the price of a Bitcoin hit $2,000, this is becoming an increasingly untenable argument. From the settlement layer view, the growing adoption of Bitcoin is increasing its liquidity internationally, allowing it to compete with global reserve currencies for increasingly more valuable transactions, causing transaction fees to rise.

Other people can have a large savings but still spend roughly same amount that they earn. Other people can spend less or more than what they earn in order to increase or decrease their savings. The value of money can be understood in terms of the reasons that make people want a lot of savings or a little, and changes to the value of money, both slow and rapid, can be explained in terms of reasons that change how much people value their savings."}

A person with savings can treat as ordinary expenses things that would be disasters for people who didn\u2019t have savings.

Not only is he in a position to be nice if people should need help, but he is also in a position to profit from doing so. A business has certain expenses that it must make regularly or go out of business. It must make payroll, for example. There is always some risk that the company will not have enough revenue for some time. The company could reduce this risk by holding extra cash, or it could use the cash to buy more capital and attempt to expand its future production. It is difficult to maintain the right balance because circumstances are constantly changing and uncertain, so even fundamentally sound businesses sometimes end up in an immediate need for cash. When that happens the business\u2019s stock price goes down because their risk of insolvency goes up. They may also be willing to take out a loan at a very favorable rate for the lender. An investor with cash on hand can help an otherwise worthwhile business survive by taking care of their immediate expenses and in return can buy the stock at a good value or earn a good rate of interest off a bond."}

Investors who have cash get first dibs on it. When one is in cash, one is uncommitted and ready for opportunity. By contrast, a lot of the potential value of an investment depends on being able to choose when to sell it. A given investment can always go down for a while, even if the investor ultimately is able to sell it at a profit. An investment has a much better chance of being valuable if the investor can expect to hold it long enough that a good selling opportunity will have occurred. Furthermore, although on ordinary days it may seem as if a stock will be easy to sell at any time, there are days when most investments other than cash drop at the same time.

In a healthy economy, maybe one or the other would have failed, but the other would have been rescued, whereas in an overinvested economy, both fail.

The most important thing about changes to the money supply is that they happen at specific places as a result of specific actions. Whenever there is deflation, there is a deflator.

Therefore, people don\u2019t do it very much. Inflation is the one you need to worry about because the person who does it gets money for nothing. That means everyone would do it if they could get away with it. Someone who can just print up money has a big advantage over someone who actually saves money because he can print up more whenever he wants. He can take advantage of good deals immediately rather than putting in the work of collecting a sum of cash in the first place. Therefore, someone who can print money discourages everyone else from holding cash. They are incentivized to invest instead."}

The investors cannot because they have reduced their savings. The inflator cannot because prices have risen and production cannot be diverted as easily as before. Thus, although the inflator appears, to the rest of the economy, like an investor with a lot of cash on hand, the economy is not safe. It is overinvested."}

The theory of reciprocal altruism tells us that it is possible for an animal to appear to be altruistic in the short term, but later to receive help from others when it cannot help itself. If an alien came down to Earth, and observed a miser he might well see the miser\u2019s behavior as altruistic because the miser appears to work hard at others\u2019 bidding without receiving anything useful in return.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "The real issue is not precisely how a Bitcoin fork could actually be implemented, but merely the understanding of how events would play out in such a situation. Hypothetical situations affect reality today. When two armies meet, if they can determine who would win without actually fighting one another, then the battle is over without having begin. This is a similar situation. If a Bitcoin upgrade were known to be unpopular to investors, then its proponents, knowing who would win if push came to shove, would tend to back down before causing that much disruption. Thus, the investors are still in control even for real-life Bitcoin upgrades that never reach the point of creating such contention."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "What are the implications of this conclusion? The motivation of investors is the value of the coin. The general rule about Bitcoin upgrades, therefore, is that upgrades which increase Bitcoin's value will be adopted and those which do not will not. Therefore, Bitcoin is not likely to be upgraded in ways which make it easier to regulate because that would decrease the value of the coins. Bitcoin might be upgraded in ways that make it more anonymous because a more anonymous coin would likely be more valuable. An upgrade which allows for larger block sizes is also likely to be adopted because the current limit of 1 MB will eventually limit Bitcoin's value as a form of money. Obvious bug fixes are likely to be adopted, whereas cockamamie schemes which do not clearly improve Bitcoin's value-such as proof-of-stake mining or changing the block reward schedule-have no real chance of succeeding and are therefore hardly worth talking about."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "This is not to say that Bitcoin is a divine substance or some immaculate bit of quintessence. It just means that Bitcoin upgrades must be a clear improvement to Bitcoin as an investment or else they face a sharp uphill battle to adoption. Any scheme to reprogram it in service of special interests would almost certainly reduce its value proposition because it would change Bitcoin from something good for the world to something good for a smaller group. Of course, people actually need to be paying attention in order to prevent it, but we also don't need to go mad with hyper-vigilance."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "I have learned that Emin G\u00fcn Sirer has expressed a similar idea in a blog post. However, he argues that it is the users who control bitcoin, having one vote per node. When I originally wrote this article, I didn\u2019t deal with this this case extensively because I didn\u2019t realize anyone was taking that position. So I am dealing with the full nodes in this note now."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "Consider the following thought experiment. Suppose, as again, that there were two forks of Bitcoin, new and classic. Now suppose that new was preferred by investors and classic was preferred by people who run full nodes. As the two classes of people expressed their preference in their actions, the investors would tend to cause an increase in the market cap of new over classic, while the node runners would tend to increase the number of nodes of classic over new. What has each class gained by this? The investors have gained an asset capable of producing a greater financial impact on the world than that of their competitors\u2019 and therefore more capable of attracting business. While the nodes do control a network, in a sense, the investors control which network becomes important."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "Over a sufficiently long time span, therefore, the interest of those who now run full nodes become meaningless in comparison to the desires of those who are now investors. There are many reasons to run a node and consequently the class of people who run full nodes is less capable of maintaining a consistent set of interests or a group identity. The investors can, and their actions can be expected to alter the composition of the group of full node runners in a way that is not matched by the effect which the full node runners have on the investors."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/", "title": "Who Controls Bitcoin?", "text": "Consequently, an individual person\u2019s control over Bitcoin should is better characterized in terms of the amount he owns than in how many nodes he runs. This is why I say your control over Bitcoin is proportional to how much you own and why I say that it is the investors, not the network nodes, who control Bitcoin. \u21a9"}

There is a common fallacy which says that price stability is required in order for a currency to function as a form of money. The way people use terms like store of value and unit of account presumes stability. However, I will show that in an unstable world, a stable currency is counterproductive and furthermore that an unstable currency serves the traditional purposes of money, to the extent that they can be meaningfully defined in unstable conditions."}

There will always be money to be made by predicting the algorithm\u2019s future effect on supply, and once people have learned to do so then the algorithm necessarily ceases to achieve its desired results. For someone who gains by anticipating such an algorithm is not producing something valuable that other people want to buy, so he must be gaining off of other investors, who are losing. That means other people holding the currency, which means that the currency cannot possibly be stable\u2014either it is dropping in price, or the supply is rapidly declining. (The outcome would depend on the details of the prescription.) This can continue until the market cap of the currency goes to zero. In order to succeed at manipulating the price to keep it stable, the prescription must never allow traders to adapt to it. It must continually be smarter than everyone else. This is not something anyone can reliably guarantee, especially a Bitcoin startup (if history is any guide). This is the same reason that attempts to create crypto-equities that track the price of gold or dollars and other things through protocols like ProtoShares and Mastercoin won\u2019t work. It is also why the federal reserve is traditionally so secretive, why the chairman tries to talk without saying anything, and why his or her every move is so deeply scrutinized."}

Everyone could treat, say, plastic poker chips as a good store of value and they would only behave like one until people realized that they were easy to manufacture. But suppose there were another metal which had similar properties to gold: it was durable, rare and difficult to extract, and distinctive enough to be difficult to counterfeit. However, the state of our science was such that it was only just being identified by chemists. This new metal would certainly not have a stable value initially upon its discovery because it would take time for the world to learn about it, but it would be perfectly rational for the chemists who did understand it to buy up as much as they could until the rest of the world had got wind of it. Once this metal\u2019s properties were understood by the whole population, then it really could \u201cstore value\u201d because everyone else would be using it for the same purpose."}

Furthermore, everyone could think this way at the same time, and the market therefore still behave fearfully. This is why people must be convinced that everyone else believes in Bitcoin too. People today are both coming to terms with Bitcoin\u2019s properties and are confused about how much the rest of the market believes in them. Hence there is fear and volatility. Nonetheless, Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited and its supply is not likely to change, no matter what else happens in the future. This is the best that can be done, as far as engineering goes, to design something to be a store of value. The rest is up to everyone else, not the engineer.

It is very simple: a unit of account is something such that to gain it is considered to be profit and to lose it is considered to be loss. Anything can serve this function, but the reason we would especially want to use liquid goods as a unit of account is that when we are liquid we don\u2019t have to think too far into the future. Thus, acquiring a liquid good serves as a reasonable end point to any venture. When you\u2019re sitting on a huge pile of cash, you know that you\u2019ll be fine for some time no matter what happens. Whereas if we were on a barter system with no highly liquid goods around, then one would have to think much further ahead in order to assess the success of a venture. Thus, thinking of profits and losses in terms gaining or losing a liquid good is essential to being able to divide the entire future into manageable tasks\u2014as long as one is gaining that liquid good, one is doing things correctly.

However, it is impossible for a good to function as a medium of exchange unless there is already demand for it as a store of value. If I\u2019m going to give someone bitcoins in exchange for something, there has to be someone, somewhere, who wants bitcoins. And he has to want to store them, even if for only a short time because of everyone tried to spend their bitcoins immediately, that would drive the price down to zero. Furthermore, the more that people want to store bitcoins, and the higher goes its value, the more liquid bitcoins consequently become and the more trade they enable."}

It was a small group that valued secrecy, and one could only get in by having a new celebrity photo.

Once one of the group members began to leak some of his own photos, others quickly decided to jump in because they realized that their collections could soon be worthless.

Krugman has done nothing to show in his article that deregulation, rather than monetary policy, is a valid response to a recession.

The babysitting co-op is a contractual arrangement and the babysitting scrip is not a currency and it does not function as money. The value of the co-op is enabling people to receive babysitting from within a group of people who already have some trust for one another. However, this is not their only option: they can also leave the co-op and pay teenagers with dollars to babysit. Above, when I described such a possibility, I said \u201cceteris paribus\u201d but, in fact, all things are not equal, because changes to the rules of the co-op can change its competitive advantage over its alternative.

Consequently, there would be a self-reinforcing trend of members reducing their holdings of scrip in expectation that others will do the same, and demanding higher prices for the same reason.

Finally, Gobry has merely repeated Krugman\u2019s claims without showing any relevance to Bitcoin, and failed to deal cogently with the evidence that Bitcoin is not at risk of a liquidity trap."}

For example, he says that one unit of scrip was worth an hour of babysitting time, when it was really worth one half-hour. He also cites the article incorrectly and gives its year of publication as 1978 instead of 1977. He does not quote from the original article to support his case or note that his interpretation of the events differs somewhat from that of the authors. None of that has any necessary effect on the logic of his position, but I think these observations suggest that his column may be strongly colored by his own preconceptions without a fresh look at the original piece. Gobry also shows no evidence of having read the original article. \u21a9"}

Not that he necessarily indulges in these purposes himself, but rather that they all drive Bitcoin\u2019s network effect just like anything else.

Thus, even though it could not exist with complete impunity, it could be recreated again and again. This is, I suppose, why its mysterious founder chose the name Dread Pirate Roberts for himself.

That was a real inconvenience. But the more I pondered it, the less of a problem it seemed. In fact, it was not a problem. If the Silk Road was attracting business, that means that going through the Bitcoin network was worth the inconvenience of doing it. That meant that there was profit to be made helping dealers spend their bitcoins\u2014which could be done by just doing more business in bitcoin! Because the drug market was using the Bitcoin network, that would draw more opportunities within it, which in turn would draw in more, and so on. These were my thoughts over the next several weeks. Of course, that's not quite what ended up happening, but I think I was pretty close.

It was where these services were excluded\u2014on the black market\u2014that Bitcoin could be most useful. This was its path of least resistance upward. Before the Silk Road existed, Bitcoin was little more than a curiosity. Afterwords, Bitcoin was something the world needed.

Considering that the law enforcement is paid only a small portion of the total budget to be extracted (50% goes to bureaucrats and the rest to other public services), consistently extracting bits of information from millions of individuals is unsustainable in the long run.

Policemen, public school teachers and alike will be the first ones to notice prices rising faster than their salaries. They will the first ones to change jobs or become largely corrupt on all levels (like it was in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union). Bureaucrats will smell the approaching panic and, instead of trying to retain control over the employees, will privatize as much public goods as possible, again, exactly like during the fall of the Soviet Union. People will see how all promised public services are either abandoned or stolen, and this time everyone will have a method to protect their own property and do business voluntarily and in an even safer and cheaper way than before. Crypto-anarchy will quickly become a boring reality without the need for anyone to remain fully anonymous."}

More importantly, he can spend bitcoins. Demand for cash exists because there is uncertainty of future needs, and the holder of cash believes he will come across currently unknown opportunities in the future that can better satisfy his needs than any current opportunities. When an opportunity exists that he believes benefits him more than what the same cash can get him in the future, he is able to seize it. As Metcalfe\u2019s Law shows us, the value of a network increases exponentially with each additional node.

Xapo debit cards, for instance, give the hoarder the ability to use bitcoins on existing credit card networks.

The more Bitcoin can be used as a method of payment the fewer dollars hoarders must begrudgingly speculate on, a risk they typically only wish on government agents and skeptical economists. Thus, the primary advantage of merchant adoption is that your average balance of bitcoins held can go up.

People will be forced to pay with bitcoins, not because of 'the technology', but because no one will accept their worthless fiat for payments. Contrary to popular belief, good money drives out bad. This \"driving out\" has started as a small fiat bleed. It will rapidly escalate into Class IV hemorrhaging due to speculative attacks on weak fiat currencies.

Over the span of several millennia, strong currencies have dominated and driven out weak in international competition.

The pound sterling in the 19th century and the dollar in the 20th century did not become the dominant currencies of their time because they were weak. Consistency, stability and high quality have been the attributes of great currencies that have won the competition for use as international money."}

The reality is that money is fungible: if you buy bitcoins instead of paying down your mortgage's principal, you are a leveraged bitcoin investor. Almost everyone is a leveraged bitcoin investor, because it makes economic sense (within reason). The cost of borrowing (annualized interest rates ranging from 0% to 25%) is lower than the expected return of owning bitcoins."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/", "title": "Speculative Attack", "text": "How leveraged someone's balance sheet is depends on the ratio between assets and liabilities. The appeal of leveraging up increases if people believe that fiat-denominated liabilities are going to decrease in real terms, i.e. if they expect inflation to be greater than the interest rate they pay. At that point it becomes a no-brainer to borrow the weak local currency using whatever collateral a bank will accept, invest in a strong foreign currency, and pay back the loan later with realized gains. In this process, banks create more weak currency, amplifying the problem."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/", "title": "Speculative Attack", "text": "The effect of people, businesses, or financial institutions borrowing their local currency to buy bitcoins is that the bitcoin price in that currency would go up relative to other currencies. To illustrate, let's say that middle-class Indians trickle into bitcoin. Thousands of buyers turns into hundreds of thousands of buyers. They borrow Indian Rupees using whatever unencumbered collateral they have \u2013 homes, businesses, gold jewelry, etc. They use these Rupees to buy bitcoins. The price of bitcoins in Indian Rupees goes up, a premium develops relative to other currency pairs. A bitcoin in India might be worth $600, while in the U.S. it trades at $500. Traders would buy bitcoins in the U.S. and sell them in India to net a $100 gain. They would then sell their Indian Rupees for dollars. This would weaken the Indian Rupee, causing import inflation and losses for foreign investors. The Indian central bank would have to either increase interest rates to break the cycle, impose capital controls, or spend their foreign currency reserves trying to prop up the Rupee's exchange rate. Only raising interest rates would be a sustainable solution, though it would throw the country into a recession."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/", "title": "Speculative Attack", "text": "There's a huge problem with the Indian central bank raising interest rates: bitcoin's historical return is ~500% per year. Even if investors expected future return is 1/10th of that, the central bank would have to increase interest rates to unconscionable levels to break the attack. The result is evident: everyone would flee the Rupee and adopt bitcoins, due to economic duress rather than technological enlightenment. This example is purely illustrative, it could happen in a small country at first, or it could happen simultaneously around the world. Who leverages their balance sheet and how is impossible to predict, and it will be impossible to stop when the dam cracks."}

For example, the Swiss will see the price of bitcoins go up ten fold, and then a hundred fold. At the margin they will buy bitcoins simply because they want to speculate on their value, not due to an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc. The reflexivity here entails that the reduction in demand for Swiss Francs would actually cause higher than expected inflation and thus an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc.

There might well be a bug that could be exploited to put the network out of commission temporarily, but would soon be fixed and then the network would be up and running shortly thereafter. To destroy Bitcoin permanently means to end the profit opportunities available with it, and that means either a malicious hashing attack on the network that makes mining impossible or such a malevolent policy against Bitcoin trade that even the black market abandons it. Both of these require spending resources in proportion to the profits that Bitcoin enables."}

Below the point that selfish mining becomes possible1 additional hashes per second are almost certainly beneficial because they increase the security of the network. Any potential attacker, therefore, must weigh in the possibility that he may end up benefiting the network instead of destroying it. A similar risk accompanies a legal attack on Bitcoin. Bitcoin can adapt to half-hearted attacks. It would move deeper into the black market where it would become permanently strengthened. Furthermore, a legal attack could be easily corrupted into one that brings as many bitcoins as possible to the government agents instead of one that destroys it (see below)."}

The Bitcoin network obviates traditional financial institutions and there are really only two agents that Bitcoin users need: exchanges and payment processors. The exchanges are temporary; they are only required because fiat currencies require them. Once the fiat currencies have died, centralized currency exchanges will no longer be required. As for payment processors, they are only required over time scales of about an hour or less to ensure that a transaction gets into the block chain. With Bitcoin there is no need for anything like a bank that would store bitcoins over a long term."}

To whomsoever a private key to a Bitcoin address is known, the bitcoins it holds are far easier to control than dollars or gold are under almost any circumstance. This is because controling bitcoins is simply a matter of keeping a number secret and requires neither securing physical matter (as with gold) or the permission of issuers (as with dollars). Thus there is a fundamental agency problem with Bitcoin. Agents can disappear or simulate a heist upon themselves. They cannot rationally be trusted without extreme costs being imposed on them which are more stringent than traditional banks. Furthermore, agents must advertise their services and consequently become the targets of hackers. They must take extreme measures to achieve a level of security similar to that which an individual person achieves with much less."}

Gox, Atlantis Market, or one of many other companies that imploded or disappeared. Bitcoin has had a problem with amateurish entrepreneurs, but I expect that we will see continued failures even when established institutions attempt to use Bitcoin."}

By contrast, in early 2014, 100 ounces of gold was worth about 100 bitcoins, and this amount could easily have been traded quickly on one of the major exchanges without affecting the price noticeably.

That does not present a good value for a newcomer because he will want a network that presents him with real opportunities, not just ways of artificially increasing transaction volume. The more that the Bitcoin network is focused on artificially increasing the transaction volume to make it look good, the more it resembles a Ponzi scheme.

Second, hyperinflation is inherently an attempt to fool people, whereas hyperbitcoinization is quite regular and predictable (at least by comparison). Therefore people will more easily see that they had better switch over. Thus, as fast as hyperinflation is, hyperbitcoinization will be even faster. It will happen much faster than you expect."}

Dies hindert den Staat, von jeder neuen Inflation immer wieder im gleichen Ma\u00df zu profitieren. Um den selben Effekt zu erzielen, muss der Staat die Inflation immer mehr intensivieren. Das Geld verliert seinen Wert, wenn die Menschen zwar eine starke Inflation erwarten aber trotzdem nicht schnell genug ihr Geld ausgeben k\u00f6nnen. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt funktioniert dieses Geld nicht mehr als W\u00e4hrung."}

Es handelt sich um einen Eingriff, der das Erreichen eines Gleichgewichts verhindert. Der Staat muss st\u00e4ndig sein Verhalten ver\u00e4ndern um seinen eigenen B\u00fcrgern zuvorzukommen. Wenn erst einmal die B\u00fcrger dieses Staates seine zuk\u00fcnftige Strategie voraussehen, ist der Staat st\u00e4ndig gezwungen diese Politik der Inflation auszudehnen."}

Deswegen erkennen Menschen viel einfacher, dass sie besser schon fr\u00fch die W\u00e4hrung wechseln sollten.

W\u00e4hrend einer Hyperbitcoinization wechseln die Menschen von einer fundamental schlechteren W\u00e4hrung hin zu einer besseren. W\u00e4hrend dessen ist es bei einer Hyper-Inflation so, dass die Menschen \u201enur\u201c dann zu einer neuen W\u00e4hrung wechseln, sobald die zu letzt gebrauchte W\u00e4hrung schlechter ist als die n\u00e4chstbessere Alternative, wie z.B.

For example, he could promise to post the price of gold every day to that stream. However, there is nothing to require him to post data on a regular schedule, and nothing preventing him from lying. This renders the datastream valueless as an input for a smart contract."}

The only thing that could require Mastercoin users from behaving properly is a traditional human legal system that recognizes its features as legal contracts and which can set the police on anyone who doesn\u2019t follow his promises. It is totally bizarre that Willett seems to think Mastercoin could be useful for anarcho-capitalist purposes. Eventually, platforms such as Open Transactions will be able to do what Mastercoin claims, without the design flaws. OT will allow for decentralized legal systems and voting pools for consumer protection, and will allow these functions to integrate directly into the block chain instead of on top as the protocol development permits."}

Either way, these waves of adopters have a destabilizing effect on the exchange rate: speculators are unsure of the amplitude or wavelength of adoption, and amateurish punters let their excitement as well as subsequent fear overwhelm them. The BCB does not intervene to stabilize these intermittent hype-cycles because steady appreciation of the exchange rate would allow for an even greater buildup of speculative excesses and the BCB would lose the confidence that AMST gives to long-term holders of bitcoins."}

However, the vast majority of bitcoin holders expect exchange rate appreciation at rates far greater than any borrower is willing to pay. Bitcoins will continue to be hoarded and bitcoin-denominated credit markets will continue to be under-developed until either the expectations of bitcoin-holders adjust downward or are met.

This is the digital equivalent of the Chicago Plan or the Austrian 100% reserve gold standard. Under this regulatory regime, money is not destroyed when bank debts are repaid, so increased money hoarding does not cause liquidity traps, instead it increases real interest rates and lowers consumer prices. This is a self-stabilizing cycle as higher interest rates incentivize hoarders to invest, while deflation increases consumption due to the wealth-effect on hoarders. The BCB prevents lending out of deposits so that it can properly target money supply and avoid the destabilizing effects of commingling the credit and payment systems."}

As more people choose that medium because of its greater marketability, it becomes even more marketable and the others become less marketable. Thus, it is to be expected in the long run that a single medium will tend to dominate the rest."}

If the buyer did not treat it as a good, then he would not be willing to pay for it, and if the seller did not treat it as a good, then he would be willing to give it away, or even pay to have it taken away.

When this is not the case, there is a real need for different computers to prove that they are working toward the same goal. The universality of the Handicap Principle in biology should be enough to make one suspect that a protocol which does not impose costs on its users invite abuse. It is interesting to think of how many problems with the Internet can be ascribed to a failure to account for this principle. If proof-of-work had been understood when email was invented, there might never have been a spam problem. If the Internet Protocol could require proof-of-work for client requests, we might not have to worry about Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.9"}

There is no block chain in the Bitmessage protocol because there is no need to store all messages forever in a database. Instead, Bitmessage requires everyone who sends a message to perform some work before the network will relay it. This ensures that every message will be meaningful: no spammer could afford to let his computer run for a minute or so for every message he sends. Proof-of-work is essential because a distributed network that relies on computation donated by its users cannot afford to allow free-riders. It is in its early stages presently and it has not yet been studied sufficiently to be considered secure, but it has enormous potential as an alternative to e-mail."}

This means that people will not tend to follow the consensus proposed by the person with the most powerful computer, but rather the person who has demonstrated the greatest investment in the currency. Miners are distinguished by something more like seniority than strength. When a miner creates a new block in the PPcoin block chain, he has to trade in some of his old coins to get the new ones\u2014meaning that everyone who creates a block is less able to create the next one.

We will need something much more complicated to make a message that is secret enough.

{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/crypto-anarchy-and-libertarian-entrepreneurship-2/", "title": "Chapter 2: Public-Key Cryptography", "text": "However, more fundamentally it is a problem because if the only encryption we know is symmetric-key encryption, then there is no way to relay message at all. Two confederates have no way of talking to one another to establish a secret protocol which would not give up everything to an interloper. We must already possess a secure means of communication in order to securely discuss a symmetric-key code! But if we had that, then the problem would already be solved."}

One of the most obvious tricks we might try is to replace letters in blocks of two rather than individually. For example, AA might become QF and BB might become LV. This would be much more secure although still easily broken with the help of a computer. We might then try replacing letters in blocks of three or four. Eventually we would reach a point that would be impossible for even a computer to break in a reasonable time."}
{"link": "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/crypto-anarchy-and-libertarian-entrepreneurship-2/", "title": "Chapter 2: Public-Key Cryptography", "text": "However, the problem with this method is that the larger the block we use, the larger is the list of substitutions.

This really opens up new possibilities: because a substitution cypher is given simply as a list of replacements, it is inherently a symmetric key algorithm. Whereas, if a cypher is given as an algorithm, and if the set of replacements it defines is so enormous that it could not practically be enumerated, then the properties of the algorithm can utterly change the properties of the cypher."}

Crypto-anarchy is not a branch of libertarian theory. It is a libertarian strategy. It is a framework for action. The cryptographic tools we have today are cheap, powerful, and profoundly individualistic. No one can hold a gun to an equation. Cryptographic software will function according to the rules of mathematics, regardless of government directives. As long as it is possible to distribute software, then cryptographic software can show people liberty."}

There is always something which is secret, but it does not have to be a message.

A machine locked by the key cannot be jump-started."}

Cryptography promotes decentralization by reducing the need to coordinate through third parties. A well-written protocol is enough to enable people to cooperate and to hold them to their obligations."}
