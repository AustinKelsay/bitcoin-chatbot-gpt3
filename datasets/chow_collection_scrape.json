If you go to commercial banking, well with commercial banks you\u2019ve got treasury services for companies, and you\u2019ve got credit lines. So corporations \u2014 like individuals in a way \u2014 I\u2019ve got a bunch of cash, I want to generate yield on it. Call that treasury services. Or I have a lot of assets and I want to generate yield on them. And I also want to borrow against my assets. And so I need a commercial grade bank to do that. I tend to have slightly different requirements and I\u2019m going to move in greater scale and I may have different accounting issues, but the commercial banking application and the retail banking are pretty similar. Exchanges are another application of Bitcoin. There, people that want to trade assets and derivatives against each other. And you can imagine infinite assets and derivatives. They will be compliance-heavy. Do you need to comply with the CFTC or the SEC or who knows what? And that gets very complicated. But it\u2019s a big business. The next big area of applications will be corporations. And here, any company that simply buys Bitcoin becomes an application of Bitcoin. And this is not a technical application. If we take Microstrategy as an example: when Microstrategy buys Bitcoin, then Microstrategy stock becomes a derivative of Bitcoin. And now Microstrategy stock is being traded on a NASDAQ, a regulated exchange. So what you did is you took one asset sitting on the blockchain and you used that to back another asset, an equity, that\u2019s trading on the NASDAQ, and then you back a third asset \u2014 calls and puts and leaps \u2014 that are trading on a futures exchange like the CME, and you may even issue debt that trades privately over the counter through a set of broker dealers. Each of those are applications of Bitcoin. Well how big are they? They could be a billion, $10 billion, you could have $100 billion worth of these applications. Why do they exist? Because people want them. Because there are a lot of people that want to trade stocks on NASDAQ, they don\u2019t want to trade Bitcoin on Coinbase. Why don\u2019t they want to? Because they took a decade to raise $100 billion and they promised a bunch of pension funds that they would only trade equities on NASDAQ and now it would take them another 5 years to reach that expectation with the pension funds. Maybe they want that because \u2014 like there are companies that do convertible arbitrage. They have $10 billion dollars, they raised it from pension funds and endowments, and they do convertible arbitrage. That\u2019s their strategy. And that means they have to be able to buy the convertible debt and short the stock and try to generate a yield. And they\u2019ve got billions of dollars to do that thing, they get up, that\u2019s what they want to buy. There\u2019s a phrase in Wall Street: when the ducks are quacking, feed the ducks. If the ducks want to buy convertible debt, give them convertible debt. If they want to buy equity, give them equity. If they wanted to buy Bitcoin, then they would want to buy Bitcoin. But these applications have different needs. If you\u2019re a consumer, you want to download Square Cash App and you want to smash buy $37 worth of Bitcoin and you want to do it in two clicks. You don\u2019t really want a super-complicated trading console with like 16 Bloomberg screens with futures and options and 3,700 trading pairs. That\u2019s not what you want. You want to smash buy $37. So sometimes simplicity is the right thing. Sometimes you want simpler than that. Sometimes you\u2019ve been doing business with the same private wealth or client adviser, you want to call him on the phone and day buy $10,000 worth of that Bitcoin, and you want them to buy the Bitcoin ETF. And the pure Bitcoin maximalist will say you\u2019re crazy! You should store $10,000 on your own hardware wallet. Okay well I\u2019m 82 years old and I\u2019m in a wheelchair and my hands shake and I don\u2019t use computers \u2014 how am I supposed to store this on a hardware wallet? I\u2019m just buying it as an investment instead of buying gold and I\u2019ve got 5 seconds. So you have 5 seconds and you talk to a guy Bill that you\u2019ve been doing business with from Merrill Lynch. You know Merrill Lynch was a company on its own before it was bought by Bank of America. So I talk to my guy Bill\u2014I\u2019ve been talking to him for 30 years. I have 5 seconds and I want to buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin. Okay, does that application matter? Sure it does. What if I want to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin? Does that matter? Sure it does. What if I want to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin? It\u2019s the same dude with the same 5 seconds, okay? So do applications scale the Bitcoin network? Yeah, absolutely. Would it be helpful to have more? They\u2019re all handles. They\u2019re a handle \u2014 I\u2019m grabbing onto Bitcoin. People handle it different ways. If I have PayPal it\u2019s installed on my machine and it works and I can click on a button in 1 second and buy Bitcoin. I prefer that to downloading a better application that takes 37 clicks and takes 2 days to get authenticated. So at the end of the day, these applications make a big difference, and what you have going on here is the creation of financial applications being wound into other exchanges and other platforms. And the platforms are everything. For example, a corporation on the NYSE takes you to the NYSE platform. A corporation on the NASDAQ takes you to the NASDAQ platform. A corporation in Japan takes you to the Nikkei trading platforms. So as Bitcoin spreads on the balance sheets of different companies and different governments, it spreads onto different platforms and it morphs into different derivatives and different flavors."}

We\u2019ve had gold functioning for a long time and we could arguably say that a lot of these institutions, technologies, government currencies, these are all applications on top of gold, effectively. So now Bitcoin is like a new base layer protocol replacing gold and enabling lots of other applications to flourish on top of it."}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim065-the-saylor-series-episode-17-how-bitcoin-changes-everything", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 17 | How Bitcoin Changes Everything", "text": "Michael Saylor 8:02\nYeah I would agree. It\u2019s the base property protocol or the base monetary protocol if what you want to do is to build something on a stable monetary base or a stable value base then you need digital money, digital property. And that\u2019s a little bit differently than digital currency, right? If you want a good digital currency, you\u2019re best to base it on a good digital money. Currency is an application of money. And if you understand it that way, money is the base layer, the end-all, be-all source of all value and virtue. And everything else is an application on top of it. I mean I don\u2019t need 100% of everything I am to be in my currency. I only need 1% of everything I own to be in the currency, and then 99% of what I am I need to be in the money. And in fact, if the money has integrity, the currency doesn\u2019t need to. Which is a pretty important point. If I had 99% of my wealth in the money and if the economy was growing or my assets are growing at 4% a year and if 1% was in the currency and the currency was devaluing at 10% per year, it wouldn\u2019t matter because its on the margin. I\u2019m getting wealthier faster than I\u2019m dissipating energy. And it\u2019s the same with a lot of things in life. The $5 that falls out of my pocket on a Saturday night isn\u2019t going to impoverish me. And on the margin you could say well you\u2019re kind of crazy to carry cash to a bar on a Saturday night. I know but I\u2019ll take the risk, for the convenience. Each of these things is putting value at risk. For example if you have $1 billion in a company you have the counterparty risk of the billion dollars in the company. If the company fails or the company\u2019s defrauded then the billion disappears but it doesn\u2019t imperil the entire blockchain. And publicly traded company that files quarterly results is a lot more trustworthy counterparty. Like Microstrategy is able to issue debt backed by Bitcoin, but we\u2019re a public company. If you were a private company and you also wanted to issue debt backed by Bitcoin, it would either be harder, impossible, or you might pay a higher interest rate. And if you were an entity, an individual that nobody trust and you went and you tried to sell the same bond maybe you wouldn\u2019t get it because people are taking counterparty risk. And they\u2019re trying to figure out whether they trust the counterparty. But now here you see the Bitcoin which is: everybody can have an application. So the question is: which exchange is going to embrace Bitcoin most effectively? Which mobile app is going to embrace Bitcoin most effectively? Which commercial bank will? Which corporation will? Which government will? Any government or municipality could issue a billion dollars in municipal bonds at 2% interest, they could buy a billion dollars of Bitcoin that has 100% yield, they could scrape the arbitrage and they could generate a billion dollars a year, right? In appreciation. You play the game right, in theory you could just issue a bunch of debt, buy the Bitcoin, eliminate taxes forever. Now you\u2019re like, Well that sounds too good to be true! Well everybody can\u2019t do it. If you\u2019re last, it doesn\u2019t work that well. For example, Mark Zuckerberg was first to own Facebook stock so he\u2019s rich forever. You can\u2019t get rich forever by buying Facebook stock now. What\u2019s the difference between you and Zuckerberg? The different is he was first and you were last. And the same is true with Jeff Bezos. So if you\u2019re the first city and you move early then as everybody else enters it\u2019s like if you came to America first and you got 1,000 miles of farmland \u2014 Lord Baltimore. You get a better deal than if you show up 9 generations late. So with this you\u2019ve got a market dynamic where the first government, the first city, the first state, the first country, they can all seize an advantage. And they\u2019re competing. I talked to an energy company the other day, I said, Well you\u2019re an energy company but you know what? You can either sell your energy to Bitcoin miners and get paid 2 cents a kilowatt-hour and you could sell your excess energy \u2014 small idea, or you could become a Bitcoin miner and you could mine with all your excess energy and make 40 cents a kilowatt-hour \u2014 better idea, or you can go big and you can buy a bunch of Bitcoin miners and/or mine it, and then you can go issue billions of dollars of debt at 2% interest and buy the Bitcoin, and then make billions of billions of dollars. If you want to make $5 billion if you\u2019re an energy company, buy $5 billion of Bitcoin and issue a press release and then wait 90 days and you\u2019ll probably make $5\u2013$10 billion. Do you want to bend over and do that? Now that\u2019s a bigger idea. But the biggest idea is: you do all those things, you reposition your company, and your revenue multiple doubles or triples because now you\u2019re not a sleepy regulated entity, you\u2019re a high-tech company. These big energy companies, you could have 20, 30, 40 billion in revenue and trade at $40 billion market cap. Well it\u2019s likely that a $2 billion Bitcoin miner will trade with a $40 billion market cap. What if the Bitcoin miners start buying the energy companies? It happened with UUNet and Worldcom back in the day where you actually saw the Internet companies buying the baby bells, buying the Telcos. And maybe they don\u2019t, but the bigger idea is the utility companies are in competition with the tech companies, and they\u2019re in competition with the financiers and the hedge funds and the traders and the governments. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care."}

If you\u2019re there first and you\u2019re right you\u2019re going to benefit the most. This is true in Bitcoin as well if you\u2019re there first you\u2019re going to benefit more than later adopters. This is also the problem with fiat in a way that the central bank has arrogated itself to always be first. It always gets to allocate itself new shares of currency, so it\u2019s kind of hijacked the hierarchy of wealth in fiat."}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim065-the-saylor-series-episode-17-how-bitcoin-changes-everything", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 17 | How Bitcoin Changes Everything", "text": "Michael Saylor 15:59\nYeah and in Bitcoin, the courageous with clarity, a vision, get to make themselves first. It\u2019s private market in money, and with fiat it\u2019s those that are politically connected that stay first. So it\u2019s public money. It\u2019s worthwhile to say: all of those organizations are competing, but we have other types of derivatives that are very interesting, or other applications of Bitcoin. Like let\u2019s take insurance: if you\u2019re an insurance company then every insurance policy you issue or annuity that you sell based on Bitcoin becomes a Bitcoin derivative. So if I want to sell you a life insurance policy that pays off a million dollars when you die and I\u2019m going to charge you x premium \u2014 I\u2019ve got to charge you enough premiums and invest them to pay off the million dollars, so if I charge it as premiums then I invest them at 2% or 3% yield it\u2019s kind of hard to pay off the million. I have to charge you a high premium. Whereas if I charge you premiums, invest them in Bitcoin, I can lower the premium. Or I can raise the payout. Or I can make the payout variable. So now you\u2019ve got an insurance company that\u2019s created a differentiated insurance product, and you can either do it explicitly by offering the policy backed by Bitcoin, or you can do it implicitly on your balance sheet. You could just take $50 billion of your balance sheet that are your collected annuities or premiums and you could buy Bitcoin with it and use it collectively to back all your policies at the corporate level. And of course insurance companies have long-durations, they have to look out 30\u201340 years, they\u2019re in business forever, they have huge balance sheets, and their traditional funding vehicle is bonds and bonds are broken. And so you need a better type of annuity generating asset or a better appreciating asset and that\u2019s where Bitcoin comes in. And that\u2019s where investment firms come in. I mean, my next application \u2014 you\u2019ve got an investment firm and you sell mutual funds or you sell investment funds and people invest with you. So if you create the fund based on Bitcoin and then you sell that, that becomes an instrument that\u2019s interesting to corporate investors, family offices, individual investors. There\u2019s a lot of people that will want to buy that fund, and there\u2019s an entire industry that sells those funds. There\u2019s also an interesting hybrid twist on that, like if you look at Fidelity, Fidelity sells all sorts of fixed income funds \u2014 municipal bond funds, sovereign debt funds, corporate bond funds, junk bond funds. They all have a low yield and they\u2019ve got a negative real yield. Well you can juice them by blending them with Bitcoin. So if I have an instrument or an asset that\u2019s been going up 100% a year and I blend it in to an asset that\u2019s been paying 3% interest, now I\u2019ve created a hybrid instrument that\u2019s got downside protection of bonds but upside opportunity of something \u2014 maybe not as much. It\u2019s like sucralose, a powerful sweetener. It\u2019s a booster, a sugar. So for an investment fund you can blend various types of funds. What if you\u2019re 50% Bitcoin and the other 50% is Bitcoin derivatives \u2014 call and future collar options. Maybe you collar the Bitcoin or maybe you\u2019re 50% Bitcoin and then you\u2019re selling covered calls out of the money to generate yield. So you\u2019re creating a Bitcoin yield fund. It doesn\u2019t have the same upside as Bitcoin but it\u2019s got a guaranteed \u2014 at some point downside protection, upside yield, you\u2019re blending the thing and you\u2019re selling it to someone that wants to buy that. Are there people that want to buy it? Sure. In a way, Microstrategy issues a bond, 6 1/8% interest, and we go and buy Bitcoin with it. If you swap the two, you\u2019ve given up the upside of Bitcoin in return for the guarantee of 6 1/8% interest. And why do you do that? Because the government is paying you 1% interest. Because the spread is 500 basis points over sovereign debt, and because the spread over investment-grade corporate debt is 400 basis points. So you want the yield. Who wants the yield? Well somebody that actually sold $100 billion of a high-yield fund to an endowment \u2014 that\u2019s who wants the yield, right? So there are structures in the financial universe. You don\u2019t just snap your fingers and change those structures in a day, week, month, or a year. In some cases those structures have formed over 10, 30, 40 years. 10 years is a short period of time in the finance world. So what you have here is investment firms that are able to create all their own financial products with any mixture and blend of risk and volatility and they can hybridize them with existing conventional assets. What if you had a fund which was half gold, half Bitcoin? For people that like gold but they can\u2019t bear to give up \u2014 or they like Bitcoin but they can\u2019t bear to give up their gold. It\u2019s like an alloy, right?"}

If you went to every conventional investor and said, Are you willing to give up more than 30% upside a year in return for all these downside protections? Yeah there\u2019s a lot. And big banks sell these all the time. They\u2019re very lucrative products. Like I charge you a 2% fee to give you a structured product that gives you some mixture of downside protection and upside that we tailored to your needs. So those are just other applications. Moving on, let\u2019s talk about trust and endowments. You\u2019ve got a family trust that\u2019s supposed to last 100 years. Fund it with Bitcoin. The Rockefeller Foundation, right? If you have any kind of endowment, every university, every non-profit has an endowment. They all have the same funding problem, which is: where do you put your money where it will last 100 years? And here this is an interesting \u2014 it\u2019s a digital transformation of money managers. I can either put $100 million into an endowment and have like 10 money managers and they charge me a 1\u20132% fee a year to manage the money, or I can just put the money into Bitcoin and I\u2019ve dematerialized the money managers. We talked about the complete digital transformation or dematerializing of the fiat banking system in our early sessions. In this particular case you\u2019re just dematerializing money managers. But there\u2019s an application: the application would be, I need a certain type of reporting and compliance. Like what if you did run a non-profit foundation and you wanted to be a custodian of $12 million? You want to flip it into Bitcoin and now you want to spend 1 hour a year monitoring your position, filing the appropriate forms with the IRS, and then you need to make disbursements. So if you\u2019re an endowment what you probably want is a credit line so you can borrow some money to pay your disbursements \u2014 your fees \u2014 on an ongoing basis. And then you want the principle to be protected. Normally you would have to re-invest it. Well what\u2019s the closest thing to Bitcoin? Probably the Vanguard 500 or the like. And if you look at Vanguard and Fidelity and you look at what they do, one big business for them is this endowment management or donor-assisted funds and they just run these funds where you put your money in this stuff and you put it on autopilot and people look at it once every 90 days. And that\u2019s a big business. Right now, $100 trillion of it is broken, because $100 trillion of it is bonds. And so you\u2019ve got massive amounts of fixed income bonds and other assets that are broken, and those are traditionally the things that are easy to manage. And if you can\u2019t do $100 trillion of bonds you have to get into equity. But there\u2019s not enough equity. So if the equity markets in the US were $35 trillion and you\u2019ve got $100 trillion in bonds that are broken, you can\u2019t just jam $50 trillion into equity. You can, but what are the consequences? You overvalue the equity, right? I mean I can\u2019t imagine any of those examples right? Yeah! Lots of examples. We overvalue the equity as we jam the money into it. And then people are waking up and they\u2019re looking for that ultimate asset-class, and the beauty of Bitcoin is Bitcoin can never be overvalued because Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace. If you jam $50 trillion into it the price would go up by $50 trillion and it would be worth $50 trillion more."}

So the more expensive Bitcoin gets, the more de-risked it is as money. So therefore it\u2019s almost like a self-catalyzing feedback loop. The more money you jam into it the more likely it is to eat all the other money in the world, the more value you would expect to be placed on it."}

Now I talked about a bunch of financial applications and also about corporations and governments as platforms, but we should also talk about hardware applications. There\u2019s a lot of hardware applications in Bitcoin. There\u2019s the miners, nodes, wallets. Any device that exists could have Bitcoin protocol built into it. And the question is: do you want to build the wallet protocols? You can build Lightning and you can build Bitcoin wallet right into any mobile device. You can build it into jewelry, right? You can build multisig into your watches, your jewelry, your phones, your desks, your appliances. And that\u2019s the differentiating business. Like people build Bluetooth into stuff. This is more important than Bluetooth. A bit more important. You can also build nodes and node capabilities right into devices, and you can build mining into devices. You could integrate these capabilities right into firmware, into hardware. And why would you do it? Because it\u2019s differentiating. If Apple builds Bitcoin support into Face ID or Touch ID on the iCloud, if the iCloud was like a multisig, multi-factor Bitcoin cloud, then you\u2019ve got a trillion dollars worth of Bitcoin that can flow into the iCloud. That differentiates iCloud. You can do it with Google Cloud, you can do it in Microsoft. You can do it in Facebook. And so Apple\u2019s interesting because it crosses hardware and software and network areas, but if you go into the software area you\u2019ve got Windows and iOS and Android and these are all operating systems. And to a certain extent things like Chrome are like their own mini operating system. You can build Bitcoin right into those things. Google built password managers into Chrome, right? And if the operating system has native support for the monetary protocol, then either that\u2019s a reason to use the operating system, or you can pass on those primitives and that functionality to the applications running on the operating system. Like, for example, Apple lets banking applications use Face ID for authentication. And that makes the banking application better. So if you want to compete in hardware and devices or in software operating systems, then putting the monetary protocol into it is just like building TCP/IP. I mean I\u2019m old enough to remember when the TCP/IP wasn\u2019t built into every computer."}

It\u2019s probably outside the scope of our conversation here, it\u2019s like an entirely other world. But with hardware and software that leads you to Cloud, right, because Cloud is another application. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and the like are all general purpose, containerized corporate platforms for spinning up massive applications. So to the extent that they have support for Bitcoin or Lightning and certain other monetary protocols, then it makes it easier for their clients like Zoom. You know Zoom went from nothing to 400 million users during Covid because they were sitting on top of Cloud platforms from an Azure or an AWS and if they weren\u2019t they couldn\u2019t have scaled. So when they\u2019re scaling they need to be able to access these underlying services, and monetary services are destined to be built into every application. And they would be a differentiator. Now if we go to another really interesting application, take social networks. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. Well, one of the killer applications for social networks is verification and credit-worthiness. Another way to say it is to put skin in the game. Right now there\u2019s no cost for malicious behavior, so if I open up my Instagram Direct Messages, 99% of them are bots, they\u2019re not really people. And when I look in my Twitter comments, a lot of times 90% of them will be bots or malicious actors. So we\u2019ve got a bot war. People have computers spinning up fake Twitter accounts and then Twitter has computers taking them down as fast as they can, and in the first hour after I post I just see a bunch of garbage. And then after a day after they clean it up I see real comments. Well what that means is there\u2019s a 2, 3, 4, 5 hour delay between when I do something and when I don\u2019t have garbage in the feed. How do you solve it? Well the logical way to solve it is I put 100,000 satoshis on a Lightning wallet and then I make a security deposit to Twitter. Or a security deposit to Instagram, or YouTube. And if you deposit \u2014 that\u2019s like $40, pick a number, it doesn\u2019t matter what the number is, something less than a lot but more than nothing \u2014 I deposit 100,000 satoshis and then people on Twitter can say I only want people with an orange check that are credit-worthy or Lightning-certified to be able to post comments on my Tweets. And I only want to receive Direct Messages from people that are Lightning-certified or verified or I follow \u2014 one of those three. And if you\u2019re not an orange check we\u2019ll call it, then you can\u2019t message me and you can\u2019t comment. So what happens? Well first of all if I just turned my entire feed to only orange check and blue check, all the bots disappear. Everything disappears. CZ does this on Binance a different way, he basically blocks everybody but people he follows from being able to post on his Twitter comments. But the problem with that is if you\u2019re only following 1,000 people, you\u2019re living in this hermetically sealed world of only 1,000 who can comment. What you want is 100 million people to be able to comment but you want them to comment with civility, or at least you want them to be human beings. So if 100 million people post $30, then you\u2019ve got $3 billion worth of Bitcoin posted as a security deposit on the Twitter network. Now everybody that comments is a real person \u2014 well let\u2019s say 98% of them are, and if someone wants to spin up 29 Michael Saylor bots, well they can do that but they\u2019re not orange checked and so I\u2019ll never see them. And no one will ever see them. Or if they want to get the orange check they\u2019ll have to post 100,000 sats 29 times. And if it turns out that they were imitating somebody, maybe they get a fine of 1000 sats or maybe they just lose their orange check and they forfeit the security deposit. It\u2019s like if you trash somebody\u2019s house when you\u2019re renting it. Whenever you rent a house or whenever you cross public properly, you either have to have insurance like car insurance, or you have to be bonded if you\u2019re a worker, or you have to post a security deposit. And if you have that concept that you have to be bonded or have to be credit-worthy, then what that means is that every time a bot attacks you it costs them $30 and you\u2019re monetizing maliciousness. If someone\u2019s stupid enough to be malicious. It\u2019s not that the platforms don\u2019t have rules \u2014 they do have rules. They take people down and kick them off and put them into the penalty box all the time. But the rules don\u2019t have consequences. If you have a computer that generates 87 million Michael Saylor bots every day, what the heck do you care about the rules. The rules don\u2019t hurt robots. There has to be a price or a cost to maliciousness. And so what you have here is a Bitcoin Lightning network that allows a billion people to post $20 each. And then you can have micropayments. And when that happens, if I go on Amazon, I look at the opinion surveys, I don\u2019t have to worry that someone created fake bots to fill in the survey. Because if you get caught faking it, you get a fine. And if I go on YouTube and someone\u2019s running a scam video and they have to have the right green check and then when they get \u2014 we report scam videos every 2 hours, Robert. Every 2 hours someone spins up a scam video on YouTube which fakes something and we report them as fast as they spin up. But there\u2019s no cost. Or there\u2019s minimal cost to denial of service attacks. There\u2019s no cost to spamming. There\u2019s no cost to hostility online. There\u2019s no cost to being an imposter. There\u2019s no cost to spinning up 97,000 fake accounts that actually try to create the appearance of a panic when it doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 cyber warfare. So what\u2019s the solution? The solution is: in the real world you have skin in the game. If you walk up to women in the street and you insult them, you take the risk that the person next to them or they punch you in the face. And if you drive your car and you get in a wreck you get fined and then you get an insurance claim and there\u2019s a consequence. And if you go rent someone\u2019s house for the summer and you trash the house and you have a security deposit, they take it. Or if you rent an apartment with a security deposit and you trash it, they take it. So there\u2019s skin in the game and that causes people to act with some degree of civility. There\u2019s no civility in cyberspace because there\u2019s no skin in the game. Why not? Well because if you use credit cards there\u2019s a 2.5% fee, it takes 2 days to clear and 2 billion people don\u2019t have credit cards, among other things. You do it through the App Store, well you could try to do it through the App Store, there\u2019s a 30% cut. How do you move 1000 satoshis for 1 satoshi in a split second? So having a value network becomes a credit network, and so for all these social networks you can actually inject the quality of credit-worthiness. And you could do it different scales. You could post 100,000 sats to get a small check, you could post 1 BTC to get a green check, you could post 10 BTC to get a purple check, and if I\u2019m going to go ahead and scalp tickets or I\u2019m going to book a flight from someone online, I want them to have a purple check because I want recourse from them if they lie to me or if they\u2019ve defrauded me."}

Proof of work to fight spam. Well we\u2019re living in a world 30 years later and we still have spam! Like we\u2019re running two levels of spam filters at my company. 90% of my e-mail is spam. I\u2019m getting spammed on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. All of the news feeds are getting spammed. And it\u2019s worse than spam, there are hostile, malicious actors that are fake bots that are waging a psychological psyops warfare to destroy people and ideas and demoralize them. And they do it for economic reasons, political reasons, etc. And there is no way to stop that in the absence of some kind of value network. So the killer app for Bitcoin with social networks is credit-worthiness leading to cyber-security. Safety and civility in cyberspace. Now if you think about where you can apply this idea of just a security deposit \u2014 which is the same as the cyber-bond if you will, or a cyber-passport \u2014 the beauty is that you don\u2019t have to disclose your identity. You could spin it up and spin it down and it\u2019s lightning-fast and dirt-cheap so it\u2019s open to everybody. But once you spin up this idea, it works across every social network, it cleans up all of the feeds, the news feeds, etc. It also works for all the communication networks. So you\u2019ve got Whatsapp, Signal, iMessage, Zoom, Gmail, every other mail, Office365 \u2014 all of these things have spam imposters, malicious accounts. The phishing attacks are ridiculous. So if you\u2019re a corporation and you want to send something, maybe you ought to post \u2014 if someone sent me a mail message and I knew they posted a 1,000 BTC security deposit and if they had it all at risk and if they could lose it instantly on the platform, I would be probably trust them more. Like it\u2019s all about cyber-reputation. If you really want me to do something risky, what do you have at risk? What\u2019s your value at risk? Now what\u2019s interesting about this is you\u2019re picking up all these security deposits, the platforms could use the float to do something if they wanted. And it\u2019s generally good for Bitcoin because it locks up the Bitcoin on the platforms. And the sky\u2019s the limit. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ve not that far from implementing fees. You could say, Look you want to send me a message, pay me 1000 sats. You can have micropayments, you could have streaming payments, you can tie services to credit-worthiness. If you go to a bank and you put a bunch of money in the bank they\u2019ll give you a higher level of service than if you put a small amount. So if you want to have distinguished services whatever they might be \u2014 it might be more bandwidth on Spaces or some other functionality. But everybody eventually can become a bank. And that takes us to entertainment/news. They have similar opportunities. They either sell access via these micropayments, or they curate the response, they create safer forms and safer spaces by requiring that you be credit-worthy in order to engage. Or they certify their news by posting some credit-worthiness. There\u2019s a lot of news circulating so if you\u2019re trying to separate fake news from real news, then you could use this to certify. You could also have service providers like Uber, OpenTable, AirBNB, and for them the idea of credit-worthiness also matters. It matters when you\u2019re pairing customers with restaurants. Like can I trust my customer to show up to the restaurant? Can I trust the driver? Can I trust the passenger? Can I trust the person that\u2019s going to come into my AirBNB? They tried to do this with reputation, but there is no more important metric I think than the credit-worthiness. If someone says I\u2019ll post $10 million in order to drive your car for the weekend, it\u2019s highly unlikely that they\u2019re going to trash your car. And one way or the other, it\u2019s just an example of an insurance policy or a bond. If you have the recourse to the bond in cyberspace, then it creates accelerated commerce, and that means that millions of people can trade with millions of people without the impedance of \u201cgetting to know each other.\u201d"}

If you have an open website, there are hostile actors in Eastern Europe and they\u2019ll unleash an array of machines and they\u2019ll just start hammering your website to take it down and it happens all the time. It\u2019s like spamming except it\u2019s worse. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no cost for denial of service. But a lot of the proof of work and the Bitcoin protocol was to protect the underlying Bitcoin mining network from denial of service attacks, right? But this actually solves the problem. If you have a web service and you require someone to have an orange check, you could actually filter on the orange check and you could then prevent the denial of service attack. You can protect yourself from it. Again, like having a credit rating in cyberspace. And since it\u2019s open to everybody in the world, anybody can have one, and it causes 98% of the malicious behavior to be non-economic anymore. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. So I didn\u2019t spend much time on retail but clearly retail is another example of a layer 3 application of Bitcoin. And it\u2019s either buying, selling, trading, security deposits or credit checks or the like as you\u2019re doing business. If I\u2019m selling something to someone and I trust them and I trust their credit rating, maybe you can do business with retailers friction-free that don\u2019t know you and you don\u2019t know them, right? And it definitely is the case that if I\u2019m Amazon or I\u2019m setting up a retail operation, people are coming at me that I don\u2019t know very well. So what I want to do is find a way to accelerate the transactional speed and I do that with some type of Lightning security deposit and/or Lightning payment. We didn\u2019t really touch on the elephant in the room here which is the Visa and MasterCard network costs 2.5%. Just the general payments network and the remittance network is another killer application. Just money movement around the planet, because the existing systems either bank wires \u2014 and small sums of money is credit cards, and you have knock-off periods. They don\u2019t move on the weekends, they don\u2019t move from certain jurisdictions to others, you can\u2019t program them, they\u2019re not automated. So you\u2019ve got a heterogeneous expensive manual patchwork quilt of payment options. And you can\u2019t scale that. So Lightning helps you scale it at the transaction level, and then Bitcoin is the core settlement network. So if you want to plug 100,000 businesses into each other and move blocks of money a million to $100 million or $1 billion at a time you do it on the Bitcoin network, and then when you want to plug the millions and tens and hundreds of millions of people into each other, you\u2019ve got to do it on these other platforms. But it won\u2019t be one. I think Lightning will be very successful, but I think that Square, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google, Facebook, they will all build their own proprietary networks and they will have additional functionality or compliance or performance or convenience built into it. Like if I bought an insurance policy a decade ago and if the insurance company just buys Bitcoin for their balance sheet, I now own a Bitcoin derivative insurance policy and I did nothing. So there are certain subtleties where the corporation or the actor can do something that provides a benefit to millions of people without them doing anything, and that\u2019s how you really scale in a big way. Like if you\u2019re a country and all of a sudden you start buying Bitcoin, your currency in circulation with 11 million people using has become a Bitcoin derivative, and it happened because someone in the back office started buying Bitcoin. So the beauty of all this is: there\u2019s a lot of ways to scale Bitcoin and there\u2019s a lot of applications. There\u2019s hundreds of thousands of applications \u2014 millions of applications. There will be lots of platforms, tools. If Twitter creates the orange check and they plug it into the Lightning Network, then who\u2019s to say that Twitter couldn\u2019t open up the API and let Google and Facebook and Apple and Medium and Reddit and Discord inherit the orange check. Twitter becomes a platform for cyber-security, and you carry your Twitter reputation or credit rating to all these other places. I mean that\u2019s what Google tries with their Google log-in and Apple has Apple log-in. They\u2019re carrying authentication around the network. There\u2019s no end to the type of opportunities that there are there, and you\u2019re only limited by human creativity."}

So what you have is you have Bitcoin as a decentralized crypto-asset network and the thing that pops up a lot is the question of, What is energy usage look like over time? And is energy usage going to keep increasing as the price of Bitcoin increases? And I\u2019ve seen commentary on this, I think a lot of people get it wrong. They seem to think that as the price of Bitcoin increases the energy usage will increase linearly. If there\u2019s a 100x increase in Bitcoin price there\u2019s a 100x in energy usage. And I think it\u2019s just worthwhile to make the observation that over the past 10 years the mining network has gone from being energy-intensive to being technology-intensive. Another way to say it is that in every single industry you go from being labor-intensive to capital-intensive. When we started with a million people sowing or farming, farming it was a labor-intensive activity. As the capital equipment gets better, first you have horses and carts and ox-carts, and then you have tractors, then you have mega-tractors, then you have factories. All of a sudden, the amount of labor matters a lot less, and the amount of capital equipment matters a lot more. There was a time when 90% of the country was farmers and now just 1\u20132% of the people in the country produce all the food, because it\u2019s become technology-intensive. The Bitcoin network is similar except substitute for labor, energy. And substitute for capital, technology. If we go back 10 years, it probably took 100x as much energy to generate an exahash as it does right now. An S19 takes 30 megawatts per exahash, but an S9 takes 150 megawatts per exahash, so you\u2019ve got 5x improvement in energy efficiency over one generation of equipment. We\u2019re like on the 7th generation of mining equipment. If you go back 2 or 3 generations then you get that 100x increase in energy intensity. If you look at where we are today and you go forward 10 years, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that you will get improvements in efficiency from three dynamics: you\u2019ve got halvings in the protocol and we have one every 4 years so that means over the course of a decade you have a 5x increase in efficiency from the halvings, then if you have a 4x increase in energy efficiency and you get it twice \u2014 or a 5x then a 4x \u2014 you get a 20x increase over 2 more generations of hardware, and now you\u2019ve got a 20x times a 5x or about a 100x increase in efficiency. So Bitcoin price could go up by 100x and the network efficiency would go up by 100x and the energy consumption could be flat. And that\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind because people sometimes think, Well energy is used to secure the network \u2014 No it\u2019s crypto-energy. It\u2019s encrypted energy that\u2019s used to secure the network. And in order to get it from raw energy to crypto-energy you have to run it through a SHA-256 miner that\u2019s properly engineered in a heat-sink. And so as the heat engineering improves, the miners get more efficient, as the semi-conductor engineering for ASICs improves, the network gets more efficient. And what you have in that dynamic is a never-struggle between brute-force and technique. It kind of reminds you of something \u2014 like nature, and competition. There\u2019s two ways to do things, right? You either use raw labor, or you use technology. And it\u2019s important to have that dynamic, or that yin and yang, because when the technologists get lazy and they stop improving, then the raw material or the brute-force overwhelms and the control of the network shifts back to the energy holders. But to the extent that the technologists upgrade their engineering facilities, their heat technology, their chip technology, then the energy becomes less important. The technology becomes more important. And the combination of both of these things require free-flowing capital. In a free market the capital is continually seeking the best use. Should I invest money in creating the next generation of SHA-256 miners? Should I invest money in engineering a more efficient Bitcoin mine with immersion cooling? Should I invest money in commercializing more energy? Or plugging in more energy and just manufacturing the same design over and over again? So what you have is this nice delicate dance or balance of power. But a model you can think of is when we first started Bitcoin mining, it was all energy-intensive. We were using off-the-shelf computer equipment and you were throwing raw and power and raw commodity materials at it. It\u2019s rotated through a set of generations of hashing equipment. So now you need energy but the limiting factor is not with the energy, the limiting factor on generating hashes is the mining rigs. And maybe you could say the limiting factors on doing this well are the mining rigs properly installed in the right mining center with the right cooling technology. And if you look forward another decade, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s going to be much more technical-intensive. You could have all the energy in the world, but you\u2019re not going to be able to generate crypto-hashes. The break-even point of an S19 is like 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. You could pay [39] cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity and make money. The break-even point for an S9 is 8 or 9 cents a kilowatt-hour. If you have 20 cent power you can\u2019t make money\u2014you\u2019ve got to turn it off. The break-even point for the generation of equipment before that is like 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. You can\u2019t pay 3, you have to turn it off. And the generation before that you\u2019re down to half a penny a kilowatt-hour. So if you\u2019re looking to run antiquated equipment to generate hashes you have to be stealing the power. If you have free energy and it\u2019s literally stolen or it\u2019s given away, you can run 8 year old or 5 year old equipment. But if you\u2019re paying your way, you have to run modern equipment. So this is a dynamic model but it\u2019s important because it\u2019s a dynamic evolution of the sophistication of the Bitcoin security network that has Darwinian overtones. Because the Bitcoin miner that just buys a bunch of equipment 5 years ago and stops upgrading becomes obsolete. You won\u2019t last 10 years with that equipment. I mean your break-even point becomes a tenth of a penny once you\u2019re four generations behind. So this is like nature healing itself. It\u2019s a very natural process. If you\u2019re out of touch and you\u2019re 1,000 miles away, the free market somewhere else is going to keep moving the state of the art forward, and should you isolate yourself you will find that you can\u2019t generate enough hashpower to participate in the revenues and the transaction fees. And it\u2019s the network\u2019s way of simply squeezing you off the network. Now what means is Bitcoin miners are organic creatures with a negative feedback loop. In essence a market mechanism. The difficulty adjustment is not just tactically every 2 weeks in the protocol. The difficulty adjustment is in the market, because if you don\u2019t upgrade your hardware every 4 years you become uncompetitive. And you can\u2019t upgrade your hardware every 4 years unless you were a responsible custodian of your capital. If you spent all your money, if you didn\u2019t save any money, if you\u2019re not trustworthy, if you don\u2019t have credit, you can\u2019t buy any equipment. And so to stay competitive on the Bitcoin network you have to be credit-worthy, you have to be competent, and you have to be credible. Someone that has the technology has to be willing to sell to you. And so I would say that the dynamic nature of the network is: you have this competition between miner, operations, and the technology providers, and the energy sources, and the political jurisdictions, and you have to be upgrading, and you probably need to be improving your efficiency by a factor of 1.5\u20132x every year. You\u2019re subject to Moore\u2019s Law and this competitive Darwinian pressure. The result of that is: energy consumption is going to fall per exahash. We\u2019ll go from 150 megawatts an exahash to 30 megawatts an exahash, to 5 megawatts an exahash, to 1 megawatt an exahash, to half a megawatt \u2014 and on down. We\u2019re just going to move down this efficiency curve. You could imagine if I gave you this supercomputer the size of a sugar cube \u2014 look at the amount of power on a modern semi-conductor, right? Think about what\u2019s in the latest iPhone chip. We just keep compressing computing power and we find a way. And human ingenuity is like that. They will keep finding a way to create more hashpower using better technique. So that suggests that energy consumption will probably increase non-linearly, like with the log of the price. If the price goes up by a factor of 10x, energy consumption might go up by a factor of 2, 2.5, 3x. At some point you start to think you will roll over \u2014 you\u2019ll peak. We might have already done it. You peak energy consumption and then you taper off or it holds constant as the hashrate increases, and instead of a Bitcoin miner spending half of their budget on energy, you roll over to spending half of your budget on capital. You\u2019re buying capital and amortizing it, and pretty soon your variable cost on energy is 5% and 40% is capital equipment, and what you\u2019ve got is not an energy war to see who controls the network, you\u2019ve got a technology to see who controls the network. Why is that good? Well because energy is a raw material in the universe, but 7th generation SHA-256 miners are specialty equipment. Everybody on Earth can find some energy and throw it at the problem, but throwing the 11th generation of SHA-256 mining equipment at the problem is something that probably no one\u2019s going to be able to do unless they spent a decade or two decades engineering that equipment and thinking about it. So you have a specialization in the same way that John Deere tractors are specialized after 100 years. And if you went back to a farmer in 1850 and you describe what a farmer in 2020 can do, it\u2019s like night and day. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on with the network. And I think it\u2019s self-healing, self-sealing, self-correcting, and the combination of the Darwinian and Adam Smith capitalist competition is a critical advantage for Bitcoin versus a proof of stake network. Because in the proof of stake network, you pretty much turn off energy competition, you turn off semi-conducter competition and innovation, you turn off engineering and heat engineering innovation, you turn off capital financial competition, you turn off the political element, and that means that I can get fat, dumb, and happy. I can just post a billion worth of my tokens and go to sleep for a decade and no one is trying to make a network so it\u2019s not being tested, there\u2019s no stressing of it, and ultimately the problem with that is you\u2019re going to suffer in integrity and durability."}

What\u2019s the price of energy? Is it going up or going down? Maybe the price of energy is going up and then it\u2019s going down. What\u2019s the price of semi-conductors? Is it going up or is it going down? Well sometimes it\u2019s going up. It\u2019s going up if there\u2019s a monopoly on the semi-conductor chips, and then it\u2019s going down when someone else enters the market. An Intel 386 chip is pretty cheap now, right? So chip prices are coming down but the next generation is going up. But again it\u2019s a competitive thing. What\u2019s the price of semi-conductors? If there\u2019s only one provider and it\u2019s a monopoly then you could say, Well the price of your semi-conductors is going to go up every generation forever and the cost of Bitcoin mining is going to go up. But there isn\u2019t [only] one semi-conductor company. There\u2019s multiple. If there is one, we\u2019re back to Jeff Bezos\u2019s statement, Your margin is my opportunity. Bitcoin is an open market for mining, so anybody can engineer a SHA-256 chip. There is no one type of Bitcoin miner. There are people slapping these things in the back of trucks and driving them around and plugging them into bootlegged power lines, right? It\u2019s not very efficient. There are people that slap 500 Bitcoin miners into a container and they just drop it on top of a pad. Does it work? Sure it does. Is it properly heat-engineered? No. Does it get hot? Very. What\u2019s the consequences of running hot? You have to turn off the mining equipment some of the time so you lose efficiency, and they burn out and their useful life is not 4 years, it\u2019s 3 years. Or it\u2019s 2 years. So there\u2019s a competition here and just like there\u2019s competition for energy, will energy go up forever? No energy could go to zero. If I invent cold fusion. Will semi-conductors go up forever? No. At some point Bitmain raises their prices and then everybody starts talking to Intel. You go to another semi-conductor company and you say, Well look Bitmain\u2019s tripled their prices and now you can make this much. And now you draw somebody else into the space. So I think there\u2019s a dynamic equilibrium between the engineering and the semi-conductor and the energy. And the best capitalized companies, they can buy the new equipment. Like the publicly traded North American companies, they will go and buy all the new shiny equipment, and poorly capitalized companies will run the old equipment. And then you will roll forward like that. It\u2019s not clear to me how much it will cost to create a Bitcoin, because that\u2019s a function of \u2014 maybe the profitability of Bitcoin is a function of the rate at which we add hashpower versus the rate at which we add Bitcoin HODLers. If we increase the number of Bitcoin HODLers by a factor of 10x, and we increase the hashpower by a factor of 2x, then the profitability \u2014 the revenue per exahash \u2014 is going to go up by a factor of 5x, right? And if we increase the exahash by a factor of 10x and the HODLers by a factor of 2x, the profitability is going to deteriorate. So the profitability of the Bitcoin mining is going to have an impact on the rate of development of Bitcoin mining semi-conductor ASICs, right?"}

But if once every 4 years I upgrade the equipment and it\u2019s 5x faster, now the question is: how much did you pay for the equipment? And the answer is: if you paid a lot for the equipment \u2014 now amortize the cost of the equipment into the cost of the Bitcoin, and you get an answer. But that\u2019s a price that a vendor charges you, which could be triple or half depending upon the competition. In a very competitive market, well let\u2019s say it a different way \u2014 if you\u2019re buying Intel grade 386\u201346 chips and slapping them into your home appliance, what is the price of the intelligence that you put inside your toaster? As a percentage of the cost of the toaster? It\u2019s pretty cheap, right? Like at some point the cost of intelligence starts to drop because it\u2019s a commodity market, AMD drove down the prices and so everybody can put intelligence into their appliance because of competition. If there was no competition it might go the opposite way. So I think that protocol guarantees us through halvings that we\u2019re going to have to get 5x as efficient every decade, but the other dynamics like the rate of technology advance go even faster. And they\u2019re just as much. I do agree with you on this one idea: we\u2019re in a gold rush right now. Or a Bitcoin rush. Between now and like 2035 \u2014 in 2035 we\u2019ll have mined 99% of the Bitcoin. So you\u2019ve got 14 years, and during the 14 years the block rewards are pretty high relatively speaking. And so it\u2019s very lucrative to be in the business, but the business is going to become less profitable, likely. At the very least we know it\u2019s going to rotate into a transaction-fee business. So instead of 90% block reward 10% transaction fee, you could expect 90% transaction fee 10% block reward. And the transaction fees are also going to scale more likely with the log of the price, not linear to the price. If I want to move a million dollars I might pay you $10, and if I want to move $10 million I would pay $12 but I\u2019m not going to pay $100. I\u2019m just going to overbid the million dollar buyer. And if I want to move $50 million I\u2019ll bid $14. So the transaction fees will increase with the number of transactions on the base layer, and that\u2019ll be a dynamic. But the block rewards go away. And so if you\u2019re a Bitcoin miner it\u2019s a very lucrative high-growth business right now, but it will move toward an efficient transaction security network later, and you would do well to buy Bitcoin. That\u2019s why it makes sense to HODL Bitcoin if you\u2019re a Bitcoin miner, because it\u2019s your hedge against two things: it\u2019s a hedge against the inevitable protocol \u2014 which the protocol says Bitcoin mining is going to get 90% less lucrative over the course, cut in half once, cut in half twice. Over the course of 12 years you get cut in half three times. So it\u2019s a hedge against that but that\u2019s the long term. It\u2019s also a hedge against the near-term hashrate explosion. If you\u2019re mining Bitcoin right now and if somebody comes out of the blue and they bring a lot of hashrate on the network faster than you expected then your market share gets cut. In that situation [HODLing] Bitcoin may win. If everybody believes that Bitcoin will win and there\u2019s a flood of people that enter the mining business, you want to own Bitcoin. Mining\u2019s going to get competitive, Bitcoin\u2019s going to get more valuable. So you definitely don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you\u2019ve mined Bitcoin, you sell all your Bitcoin for cash \u2014 in that case you\u2019re attempting to run a cash business in 16 years when the revenue\u2019s been cut in half four times. Presumably if you cut a 100 to 50 to 25 to 12 to 6, when you\u2019re generating 6% of the revenue and everybody else has had 16 years to get in the game, it\u2019s going to be more of a commodity business. Now that\u2019s not to say that a Bitcoin miner can\u2019t compete and evolve, it may be a great business then too. It may be that Bitcoin miners evolve to be running Lightning nodes or running layer 2 platforms of other sorts. It might be that as a Bitcoin miner you have a huge Bitcoin treasury and then you can generate yield on it. It might be that there are other applications. We\u2019ll talk about some. It\u2019s very logical for Bitcoin miners maybe to get into some of these other application areas that will pop up in time. And there are technology possibilities here. So I would say the illogical thing to do in business is you don\u2019t worry about what happened 16\u201320 years out if you can make a ton of money now. I mean you might very well make enough money now to have 10, 20, 30, 100 billion dollars of capital then, at which point you can go buy something else to get you in the business. And my other point I guess here is: yes it\u2019s true, Bitcoin miners should keep Bitcoin. But it\u2019s also true that non-Bitcoin miners should keep Bitcoin. Like if you believe in Bitcoin, then the logic follows that no matter business you\u2019re in, if you have operating income, you should invest in Bitcoin. And if you are able to generate financing, if you can raise debt or equity then you should also raise debt and invest that in Bitcoin. That would be the case for other companies. Microstrategy looks at it that way and we\u2019re not even a Bitcoin miner. But that\u2019s my thought on the Bitcoin mining network and the dynamic model over time. I think that some people intentionally misunderstand this, like proof of stakers, they intentionally misunderstand because if they misunderstand it then they can assume that energy consumption is linear, and then they can play the ESG card and pretend that they\u2019re virtue-signaling and say that they\u2019re doing something good for the environment because they\u2019re not using energy. But the truth is that they\u2019re not using energy nor are they using technology. They\u2019re not using hardware technology, engineering technology, or energy, nor are they submitting their network to competition, and they\u2019re not using external capital, political or financial. What they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re creating a virtual protocol in order to create security. And even there, if you\u2019re going to rely upon a virtual protocol to create security you\u2019d be better off to stake the protocol with an asset that is outside of the network, that is external to the network. So for example, the Lightning Network makes a lot more sense because it\u2019s staked with Bitcoin, than if it was staked with \u201cLightning Coin.\u201d"}

It\u2019s a crypto-universe. Satoshi played God, you either call it creating your own universe and setting the planets in motion by defining the space-time constant, or the other metaphor is you released a creature into cyberspace and set the genetic DNA of the creature. You controlled how it will procreate. And once you release the thing, then it spreads as some kind of swarm life-form continually evolving. So I think with that we conclude that the Bitcoin mining network and the Bitcoin network in general is quite a wonderful thing. Now the next question is: how does it scale? If we go beyond the network, the primary purpose of the Bitcoin mining network is to provide security and enforce protocol integrity and durability of the system. And it does that very well. But so how do we actually scale out to provide hundreds of billions of transactions a day to billions of people on the planet at the speed of light using the latest computer technology? That\u2019s I think where a lot of people fall down, they just want to look at the base chain and say, Well it moves 7 transactions a seconds and so you can\u2019t scale. But they lack the imagination to understand the consequences of the layering. So the Bitcoin monetary network, it scales based upon platforms at the layer 2 level, and then applications above that level, and you could call them layer 3 applications or you could call them applications on top of applications on top of applications. So you could have layers 4, 5, 6, and 7 and you could have interplay between the applications, but for the purposes of our discussion let\u2019s just call them layer 2 platforms and layer 3 applications in order to keep from getting too confusing in our semantics. So what\u2019s the most important one? Well Lightning is a very interesting and maybe the most important layer 2 platform. And the idea behind Lightning is: I want something to be exponentially faster and exponentially cheaper and in return I\u2019m willing to secure exponentially less money. So if I have only $100 at risk, then there\u2019s no reason why I couldn\u2019t do 10 million transactions on that channel. And that totally makes sense because as you scale out, if you look at the transactions that 8 billion people need to make on this planet every single day, the majority of the transactions are actually of value less than one dollar. In fact there are plenty of transactions that could be valued in pennies. And then the big transactions might be $10, $100, or $1,000. Probably if you were to look at the transaction stream on the Visa network or the MasterCard network, the average check is like $28 or something. But there\u2019s billions and billions and billions of them. So you don\u2019t really need the final settlement security of Bitcoin, because that\u2019s the highest level of security in the world. And you\u2019re getting that to move a billion dollars. You probably only need to move a billion dollars around occasionally. If I moved seven nuclear-powered aircraft carriers per second anywhere in the universe, I could probably win whatever war I wanted to win if that\u2019s what I\u2019m using my teleportation power for. So Bitcoin is good for teleporting large chunks of value, but for all of the routine work, you want something smaller. So the logical thing to do is \u2014 the way Lightning gets at it is you\u2019re putting liquidity in the channel and the channel is at risk, but the overall blockchain isn\u2019t. The beauty is you get to keep your keys and keep custody of that. So that a very fascinating thing. You can build the universe on Lightning. Presumably, you could give 8 billion people Lightning wallet or wallets \u2014 more than one \u2014 you can build Lightning into PayPal and Square Cash and Apple Pay and Google Pay and Facebook and every messaging app, and you could use it at all scale, not just to move money but to move anything. The other day I did a 1,000 satoshi transaction on Lightning for 1 satoshi in 1 second. So Lightning is an obvious layer 2. And the simple design idea is: I create a channel with a million times less Bitcoin in it, and I move it a million times faster. And that works fine. And there are other approaches of course, but you can give up all of the proof of work because you don\u2019t have as much at stake. And you\u2019re creating a staked network but you\u2019re staking it with an external asset that derives its value from assets external to it \u2014 energy capital and political capital and technical capital are flowing into Bitcoin capital and Bitcoin capital is flowing into the Lightning Network in order to secure it. So once you get that idea, you realize that a layer 1, layer 2 solution is a lot better idea than a higher performance layer 1 solution. Because making the layer 1 twice as fast or 3x as fast or 10x-100x as fast doesn\u2019t get you to a million times as fast. It\u2019s no different than the common-sense way that human beings solve every problem: if you had a million dollars in the bank and you were going out on a Saturday and you needed to spend money quickly, you would take $100 in cash and you would break it into 20 $5 bills, you put it in your wallet, and you would rest assured that you can\u2019t lose more than $100 and you would leave the rest of the money locked up in the bank. And the money in the bank takes 48 hours to get at and takes lots of degrees of authentication that\u2019s behind 3-feet of steel, and the money in your wallet is in your front pocket and it takes 1 second to get at and occasionally you drop a $5 bill on the floor when you\u2019re drunk and life goes on. And if somebody said you had to take the entire million dollars with you out to a night club with you every Saturday night you would say, That\u2019s pretty stupid. And if they said, Well you know the bank vault doors they\u2019re too heavy, we\u2019re just going to have to re-engineer them to make them 1,000x lighter so that you can open the doors faster so that you can access the million dollars on Saturday night while you\u2019re drinking \u2014 you might think, Well maybe it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to actually have access to all my money while I was out drinking on a Saturday night? And the same is true with the idea of a base layer. Maybe it\u2019s not such a good idea to have that many transactions on the base layer, because every single moving part is just something to break. So you\u2019ve got yourself too many moving parts \u2014 you don\u2019t want it. So the layer 2 platform is this idea that what I want to do is I want to just create a cash, if you will, of a much smaller amount of value that is much less at risk that I can afford to move much quicker and I don\u2019t need the same degree of security on it. And Lightning is not the only layer 2 platform you can conceive of. Another crypto-network could be a layer 2 platform. In theory you could spin up a proof of stake and you could stake it with Bitcoin and it wouldn\u2019t be a theoretically different thing. You can also spin up a crypto-network proof of stake and then you can move Bitcoin through it, but if you\u2019re using the native token and moving Bitcoin then your Bitcoin is only as secure as the native token. And of course if the token is ginned out of thin air \u2014 Yoyo-coin \u2014 then that\u2019s a problem. Ultimately the real issue with layer 2s is you\u2019re moving a portion of value into that layer 2, trusting the layer 2 in order to get performance or functionality. So you can do it, you can do it with Lightning, and the logical thing you do is you stake with Bitcoin and then you reduce the risk to the channel liquidity. That\u2019s a way to do it and that\u2019s logical. Another way to do it is to build some kind of system like maybe if I was an exchange and I had Bitcoin on the exchange and I created an API to the exchange that was programmable. Then in a way the exchange is holding the Bitcoin, the API is providing you with a very fast speed. Now you\u2019ve taken a different risk. You\u2019ve taken exchange risk, which is some counterparty risk of some sort. If you use a Paxos or a NYDIG platform those are more conventional platforms to build applications on top of. Like NYDIG has a platform for you to build a credit card plugged into Bitcoin. And Paxos has a platform plugged into PayPal to their application. So if you want that kind of platform you plug the mobile application into one of those platforms \u2014 there is some risk with that counterparty \u2014 it is limited to the amount of Bitcoin you\u2019re handling on the platform. And you can do all sorts of things to mitigate the risk, but clearly there is a need for layer 2 platforms. And there isn\u2019t a need for just one layer 2 platform. Like Lightning is a compelling, decentralized layer 2 platform because it\u2019s decentralized. But there are a lot of layer 2 platforms that will be centralized because they need to be regulated in order to meet with regulatory compliance obligations. And there are a lot of counterparties, like a credit card company might prefer to work with a centralized layer 2 than a decentralized layer 2 because they have regulatory constraints."}

And performance and functionality and compliance are not on your list. Your list is durability, integrity, immortality. Very simple. But as you move towards applications and you move away from property towards applications, you either have to optimize for functionality \u2014 like if there is no functionality there is no application \u2014 or you have to optimize for performance. If I can\u2019t pay for the coffee within 1 second I can\u2019t pay for the coffee. Or you have to optimize for compliance. If I really wanted to issue an insurance policy or I want to issue a security or if I want to issue a yield token, and it\u2019s illegal in a certain state, then if I want to do it I have to actually comply. And compliance pops up with stablecoins. Compliance pops up with DeFi exchanges. Compliance pops up with derivatives. Compliance with pop up with anything that looks like a security token. These are all applications, but is there a future for those applications on top of Bitcoin? Yeah. But Bitcoin is not the application. The application will be built on a layer 2 platform. Or it\u2019ll just be built naked against the Bitcoin. Maybe you don\u2019t use a platform, like I can implement my Bitcoin credit card using the NYDIG platform, or I could hire an army of programmers and I could build it one-off, right? There\u2019s this little battle of: Do I build a custom app or do I build an app using your SDK? So platforms are going to be operating system-type things with an SDK, and it might be that it looks like an AWS where they spin up services. You could imagine an AWS spinning up a whole package \u2014 like a Lightning node \u2014 if I could spin up my Lightning nodes and run them maybe I would do that. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t do that. Probably Lightning is not the best example because people are looking for something totally decentralized there, but a better example would just be an SDK that allows someone to deploy a mobile app that has Lightning and Bitcoin money transfers embedded in the mobile app and I just want to do it quick and easy."}

Massive competition with regard to: what are the SDKs in the layer 2 toolkits? And even Lightning has Lightning Labs developing a toolkit to help you with Lightning. So that\u2019s competition, and it\u2019s interesting but it gets theoretical in a way so it\u2019s actually probably more instructive to move down to the applications themselves and talk about: what are the applications of Bitcoin that scale the system? Because these are the things that make the different. And once you start to think about the range of applications then you figure out what you might build into your platform if you\u2019re trying to create a business hosting those applications. Let\u2019s talk about that. The obvious application is the individual HODLer that owns Bitcoin or just HODLs it in cold storage for long periods of time. It\u2019s like the family or the individual. I think that\u2019s pretty well understood and that\u2019s been pioneered for a while. The thing that\u2019s varying is the way that that individual chooses to HODL the Bitcoin. And that\u2019s where it gets really interesting. For example, one thing that I want to start with is this observation that one interesting application of Bitcoin is a bond. You can actually create a derivative or a security of Bitcoin and scale the network with the bond. So if a government owns Bitcoin, the government is the customer. And if the government then buys the Bitcoin and then issues sovereign debt, the sovereign debt becomes a Bitcoin derivative. So you\u2019re creating credit from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the base layer money, and the debt or the credit or the bond of the government is the layer 2 money. It could be backed in whole by Bitcoin like 100% or it could be backed in part. If a municipality like a city buys Bitcoin and issues municipal bonds that becomes another form of an application of Bitcoin. If an agency like Fanny Mae or Freddie Mac or any international agency \u2014 United Nations or the like \u2014 if they were to buy Bitcoin and then issue any kind of bonds, it\u2019s another example of a derivative. When a corporation buys Bitcoin like Microstrategy and then we issue a bond that\u2019s backed by the Bitcoin, we created a derivative. And you could even take Bitcoin \u2014 there\u2019s $700 billion of this Bitcoin out there \u2014 and you could issue asset bonds. Call it Bitcoin-backed securities. They used to be called mortgage-backed securities. And with mortgage-backed securities we\u2019d take a bunch of heterogeneous assets and we\u2019d securitize them into a note, and so imagine you had 21 million identical houses called Bitcoins and you decided that you were going to create a bond backed by 11 or 37 of them \u2014 an asset-backed bond. All of those are applications of Bitcoin. They\u2019re not applications the way a computer scientist thinks of them. They\u2019re financial applications of Bitcoin. You can have technical applications of Bitcoin that are running on mobile devices like mobile apps, you could have web applications, you could have financial applications of Bitcoin. And a lot of times when people think about scaling, they only think about the technical applications and they don\u2019t really think about the financial applications. If we move on the next layer or next type of application, think about mobile payments. A mobile app that does payments is something you can plug into Bitcoin, like Square and PayPal have plugged mobile apps into Bitcoin. What does the app do? Maybe it lets you buy Bicoin, sell Bitcoin, send Bitcoin, send Bitcoin via the Lightning Network like the Muun wallet \u2014 that\u2019s an application \u2014 but maybe it lets you send Bitcoin on its own proprietary network like Square Cash Tags. You can send Bitcoin between one Cash Tag and another Cash Tag instantly for free. You could send Bitcoin between any two mobile apps within the network using the handle of the network. If you were doing that, then probably the application provider custodies some of the Bitcoin and they\u2019re moving it and they become a fractional bank of Bitcoin. Bitcoin becomes the central bank in cyberspace. Our friend Ross Stevens would say the Decentral Bank in cyberspace. All of these other mobile apps or websites become fractional banks plugged into the central bank of cyberspace. And they custody some amount of Bitcoin. The mobile payments space is particularly promising, because all these mobile applications are one step removed from being mobile banks, and there\u2019s no reason why Facebook and Apple and Google and the like don\u2019t eventually become mobile banks. It was a matter of time before they let you send photos, and then at some point they decided to let you send videos. And then they decided to give you emojis. And then they decided they\u2019d let you send audio files. And in a way you could think of Bitcoin as just another file type."}

Now you start with mobile payments and then when you start to think about moving that around and the services that consumers want, you\u2019re now into retail banking. The retail banking applications are in essence savings accounts and credit lines based on Bitcoin for consumers. You\u2019ve got billions of people that presumably want a wallet with an asset in it, and the asset would be Bitcoin. Then they want to borrow against it. So you want to be able to draw down a credit line at an interest rate. So I carry around $10,000 in Bitcoin, I borrow $1,000, I pay 4% interest. Now I\u2019ve drawn the credit line in the local fiat currency in question \u2014 Euros, Dollars, Yen \u2014 I pay the interest whatever that is, and then I spend the money. That\u2019s pretty popular. I mean credit cards are quite popular, right? How many credit cards are there in the world? So we\u2019re really talking about credit cards drawn against Bitcoin property instead of unsecured credit lines. The opposite is also the case: maybe the consumers want savings accounts that generate yield. So I have Bitcoin, I either HODL the Bitcoin, or I move the Bitcoin into a yield-generating account, or I move the Bitcoin into a collateral line and I use it and pledge it as credit. Now is that the same everywhere in the world? No not really. You\u2019re going to have different regulators in every jurisdiction. Every state they\u2019re going to tell you whether you need a money transfer license or a banking license or whether or not you need a securities registration in order to give yield or give loans or move money around. Of course, there are always nuances. I think this is one of the nuances that caused El Salvador to designate Bitcoin as legal tender so that they could easily move Bitcoin around in mobile apps. In a place where the government has collapsed, then the solution is going to be a mobile wallet with Lightning because there isn\u2019t a regulator. And wherever you have the kind of weak governance then it\u2019s not going to matter. As the governance gets stronger then there are going to be questions of: what\u2019s your compliance requirements to do a retail banking application? It looks like it\u2019s literally different state to state, country to country, jurisdiction to jurisdiction and evolving right now. That\u2019s one of the reasons why maybe centralized applications \u2014 CeFi \u2014 will actually beat the DeFi, because the message of DeFi is: Oh it\u2019s really expensive going through all this KYC. Yes that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also illegal not to. So the real question will be, Can you do it and how much validation do you have to go through to do it, and how compliant do you want to be."}

In all these cases, Bitcoin is becoming more secure, more long-lived, because it\u2019s co-opting important actors in each of these three areas. We need a network of politicians to defend the network. You need a network of technology providers and semi-conductor providers in order to secure it. We need a network of energy providers to secure it. The fourth area that\u2019s fascinating to me is the financial dimension of security of Bitcoin. Because miners are capital-intensive, you need capital to build the mining facilities that require the rigs and to do the engineering. So that capital comes from outside the Bitcoin system. So it\u2019s US Dollar capital for the most part, or its currency equivalents. Bitcoin miners therefore are recruiting a network of fiat investors. There\u2019s a whole set of conventional investors, they can\u2019t buy Bitcoin or they wouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin but they would buy an operating company that mines Bitcoin. Kind of like people that don\u2019t want to own gold but they want to own gold mining companies. So this is incredibly stabilizing for the network, because for example today the news was: Fidelity had bought 7% of Marathon. So a big, credible, traditional investor \u2014 I think Fidelity has like $2 trillion dollars, trillions of dollars of capital, 20 million customers, and they\u2019ve been around forever\u2014that company is now invested in a Bitcoin miner. How does Bitcoin benefit? Well now you\u2019ve got hundreds of millions of dollars to lose if the Bitcoin miner fails, and so the investor has a vested interest in protecting their interest. So Bitcoin recruits a whole network of legal, marketing, and political lobbying capability as it recruits investors. There are trillions and trillions of dollars in the conventional economy that for legal reasons or political reasons or business reasons or tax reasons or practical reasons and technical reasons they can\u2019t buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a security based on Bitcoin. So in fact from their point of view, they would prefer to buy the publicly-traded company, or if you\u2019re a public company investor, you would prefer to buy a publicly-traded company, and if you\u2019re a private investor you\u2019d prefer to buy the stock of a privately-traded company, and that\u2019s just what their pooled capital does. So if you want to co-opt that financial network of investors, you need a capital-intensive use of proceeds. So Bitcoin mining is capital-intensive and proof of work is capital-intensive. If I snap my fingers and I go to say proof of stake and you don\u2019t actually need to buy equipment and you don\u2019t need to engineer the facility and you don\u2019t need to buy the energy, then you don\u2019t need the capital. Well then you don\u2019t need the investor, then you don\u2019t need the investment banker, then you don\u2019t need the market they trade in. I guess then you don\u2019t need the support of the congressmen, the senators, and the regulators they know, and you probably don\u2019t need the media journalists that they talk to. You\u2019re losing all of that, right? And you\u2019re also starting to look like you\u2019ve created your own different system. You\u2019ve created a virtual world where the politicians and the media and the capital and the bankers in the other world are irrelevant. You created your imaginary world. And Bitcoin mining bridges the Bitcoin universe \u2014 the crypto-asset of Bitcoin \u2014 with the physical and the political universe. And if money is socio-economic energy, well there\u2019s two elements to that. The energy part says that it needs to be thermo-dynamically sound and conservative and correct. But the socio-economic part says: you need the politicians and you need the media and you need the influencers. So the process by which I construct Bitcoin mining companies is a process of recruiting the support of bankers, investors, politicians, and influencers, as well as technologists and energy producers. And that is a virtuous process. That is actually the hard work. You can think of it as when you\u2019re building the Bitcoin mine, that\u2019s the foundation upon which you\u2019re building the bridge. You ever look at these bridges that cross the Chesapeake Bay they have to dig down and they have to put in place massive pilings in order to build the bridge on top of it. So if the sub-structure and the foundation is weak, then the bridge itself is prone to collapse. The Bitcoin miners themselves, they do all four of these things. And then the fifth layer of security is the network itself. And by the network I\u2019m really referring to the Bitcoin mining centers. Every place that Bitcoin miners set up their own mining center, they\u2019re plugging into the energy grid, they\u2019re bringing in the mining rigs, they\u2019re engineering them and suiting them, they\u2019re getting the political support, they\u2019re raising money, and now the miners themselves have their own companies. And there\u2019s a lot of public companies and a lot of private companies. We\u2019ll have like a dozen publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by the end of the year, but let\u2019s say there\u2019s hundreds of private companies. All of these companies are part of the network of security for Bitcoin. They all have skin in the game. They all have invested human capital, financial capital, technical capital, energy capital, time. As you can imagine, they don\u2019t want to lose that, right? They feel pain. And so because they feel pain, they don\u2019t want to lose that. They invest to protect that. And so how do you invest to protect $100 million invested in Bitcoin mining? You\u2019re going to contribute to political campaigns, you\u2019re going to hire lawyers \u2014 you know there are experts in Texas energy law. You\u2019re going to hire lobbyists, you\u2019re going to hire marketing people that are going to explain why Bitcoin is good for the world, not bad for the world. You\u2019re going to hire HR people to manage all your HR issues. You\u2019re going to hire financiers to report this to the investors. You\u2019re going to spend a lot of time talking to all these constituencies to make the investors happy, keep the politicians happy. You\u2019re going to be an early warning system against mishap, like if there\u2019s a bug in the software of Bitcoin, or if there\u2019s a bug in the hardware of Bitcoin, if you don\u2019t trust the mining rig manufacturer you\u2019re going to push back. If you think that the software is not being fast enough or the hardware is not being upgraded fast enough to keep the network secure and to protect your investment, you\u2019re going to lobby and agitate. And you\u2019re going to do that in a context where there\u2019s a balance of power between you and the node operators, the validators \u2014who is a lot, like there\u2019s a lot of them\u2014and there\u2019s also a balance of power with Bitcoin investors. If you try to change the number of Bitcoin or you try to change the block size you\u2019ll probably have a lot of Bitcoin HODLers that\u2019ll push back on you. And then you\u2019re going to do it in balance with your fiat investors, the people that hold your securities, or the derivatives. And you\u2019re going to be managing the business to try to stay in alignment with regulations in 100 different jurisdictions. And you\u2019re going to be communicating all the time. So the Bitcoin mining network is the fifth layer of security of proof of work, and ultimately when you get to a point where you have 50 well-capitalized Bitcoin miners and they\u2019ve got billions of dollars each at stake and they\u2019re spread across all the countries in the world, then they are in essence the first line of defense for Bitcoin. You can call them different things \u2014 I refer to them as a motor of sovereignty. They\u2019re running the motor that keeps the sovereign network fresh, and they\u2019re providing the transactions and the security. But you could also look at them as the roundhouses on the wall. They are the first thing you\u2019re going to attack, right? When you decide you want to attack Bitcoin you\u2019re going to attack the Bitcoin miner. They\u2019re the first thing to get attacked. Since they have the most at risk, if you\u2019re a Bitcoin miner in China, what have you suffered? A lot. They have the most to lose. And so the Bitcoin miner in Switzerland is going to be spending a lot of time thinking about whether there\u2019s a political attack coming from Switzerland on Bitcoin. They will be the early warning system, the canaries in the coal mine, if you will. So those five layers, they\u2019re implied by the proof of work algorithm, and we get energy, technology, politics, we get finance and we get network support, and they\u2019re all sources of inertia and antifragility, and they all draw forms of capital that are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is capital, but dollar capital, semi-conductor capital, political capital, energy capital, human capital \u2014 all of these forms of capital are creating a genetic diversity and a Darwinian vitality for the network. If I get rid of all that capital, if I just said, Well Bitcoin\u2019s going to become a proof of stake network and we\u2019re just going to stake Bitcoin to run Bitcoin, you see what you\u2019ve done is created again a hermetically sealed, closed system, but that becomes an inbred system. And that means the biggest Bitcoin HODLer, when they go insane, the security\u2019s not going to get upgraded, right? We\u2019re not going to continue to distribute the network, we\u2019re not going to upgrade the technology anymore, we\u2019re not going to spend much time complying with the local political rules. And Howard Hughes was the richest man in the world, he ended up retiring into the top floor of his hotel and didn\u2019t come out of his room for 7 years, he went bat-shit crazy. You know you can do that when you\u2019re the richest man in the world when you don\u2019t need anybody else, but you can\u2019t do that when you have responsibilities. You have to get up every day and you have to go and put on a suit or a tie or at least conform with the local mores, and that keeps you from going off the deep-end or off the abyss."}

That\u2019s what makes it real, that\u2019s what gives all these actors skin in the game. And the proof of stake model would be something that severs that bridge. We have this digital reality and physical reality that\u2019s anchored by energy expenditure, but if you moved to proof of stake you\u2019ve now severed that bridge. On the network mining specifically there\u2019s this dynamic equilibrium of the governance between the miners, nodes, and all these various stakeholders. And the last point that I think is really important and we saw exhibited in this Chinese mining exodus was: the network is very amorphous. If one jurisdiction tries to stamp it down, what happens? A lot of these miners get boxed up, shipped elsewhere, plugged back in."}

But it\u2019s a swarm creature that lives in the physical world and in the political world. It is not a creature in cyberspace. It\u2019s not a disembodied astral projection. If you cut the cord, if you don\u2019t need energy, if you don\u2019t need the semi-conductors, if you don\u2019t need the political support, if you don\u2019t need external capital, and if you don\u2019t need to engineer a facility, if you don\u2019t need a corporate structure, then you\u2019ve created a virtual world like Second Life. And now if I create a virtual world and I design in it a virtual money or a virtual token, and then I stake that virtual token to secure a virtual network so that people can trade virtual goods and virtual things, I can create virtual security but it\u2019s virtually certain that someone\u2019s going to create another virtual world, right? The problem is: yeah you outsmarted yourself. You created something which was free and easy, which means that the guy that copied whatever to create Ethereum, well then the guy copied Ethereum to create Cardano and then someone copies Cardano to create the Uniswap and then they make SushiSwap and then they make the next thing. Because you could do it fast and easy. What you\u2019ve done is you\u2019ve created a virtual casino or a virtual world and virtual money. And it\u2019s not that you can\u2019t create a business around it. Like Second Life is a business. Fortnite is a business. Online gambling is a business. You can create a virtual casino or a virtual game or a virtual world \u2014 Dungeons and Dragons \u2014 and you can live in it and you can buy your virtual Vorpal Blade and you can use it to kill the virtual dragon. But the problem is: you don\u2019t have a bridge to the thermodynamic real world, nor do you have a political bridge to the political world, and you have lost the space-time constants that give the property integrity, and durability\u2014and that\u2019s a good segue for me to go to layers six and seven. The sixth layer is the spatial layer and the seventh layer is the temporal layer. So by spatial layer I mean the proof of work Bitcoin mining network forces you to spread out throughout the world, because you\u2019re not going to find 120 terawatt-hours of energy in one building. And even if you did in one building, the heat engineering is such that you can\u2019t stack the Bitcoin miners up over each-other like that. So you have to spread out, and the natural competition means that well we find a volcano here and a nuclear reactor there and we find some stranded gas here. It\u2019s an open system and it\u2019s naturally diffusing and decentralizing, and that\u2019s important. If you have a proof of stake network and I have 50% or 20% of all the money, then I can just stake the entire network in Monaco. Why would you need to spread it to the four corners of the Earth? Well the problem with staking the network in Monaco is that maybe Monaco has a political attack, or maybe the building gets wiped out. What if I stake the entire network on like 16 computers in the same place? You\u2019re centralizing it and there is no thermodynamic incentive to decentralize it, and there is no requirement. But in fact with proof of work and the requirement of energy, it naturally is going to create an incentive for someone to put this on a waterfall in the middle of Africa. And that distributes the security load. You don\u2019t want all the security to come from Manhattan. If all the security comes from Manhattan that\u2019s proof of stake, that\u2019s centralized, pretty soon you\u2019ve got a central bank. Pretty soon three people get together and decide your destiny. Everything just centralizes. You really want to have the security to come from a country that you can\u2019t get to, because if you can\u2019t get to it, your enemy can\u2019t get to it. And ideally it decentralizes so it\u2019s even hard to distinguish where it\u2019s coming from. So that spatial layer is forcibly decentralizing it, and it\u2019s not just decentralizing it geographically, it\u2019s also decentralizing it politically. And that causes it to decentralize across lots of institutions, lots of political jurisdictions, lots of geographic places. And if you want to attack it, there is no one central place to attack. You can\u2019t define the vector. There\u2019s no logical nexus and there\u2019s no physical nexus. Like how do I find the top 51% \u2014 like 51% of the hashrate is in 198 facilities around the world \u2014 how do I take control of all 198 of them overnight without anybody noticing? Because that\u2019s crossing 100 borders."}

And it even becomes somewhat immune to a protocol attack where someone tries to get people to change the protocol. It\u2019s just much harder to attack the durability and the integrity of the network because it becomes so spatially distributed. Proof of stake, 10 people might actually stake 51% so now I can actually identify the 10 people. Now I know who to attack. Psychologically, physically \u2014 whatever. I don\u2019t even know where to start with something which is spatially distributed. So the seventh layer is temporal distribution. And by that it just means that the attack has to come over time, because it takes 12\u201324 months to create a world-class Bitcoin mining center. It takes another 12 months maybe to order all of the equipment. So how do I go about ordering 7th generation equipment secretly or with malicious intent, and then I have to convince someone to front me the money, right? So I have to hoodwink billions of dollars of investors, then I have to buy billions of dollars of equipment, then I have to wait 12 months, then I have to get someone to engineer the center and I have to get them to agree to do it because they trust me, and they\u2019re not going to do it if they think I\u2019m going to attack the network. Then I have to convince the politicians to let me build it \u2014 it\u2019d take 3\u20135 years. Then I have to get all the engineers, then I have to build it, then I have to bring it online so that I can attack the network. And I\u2019ve got to do all of that without a single person guessing that I\u2019m trying to do it. If one person thinks that I might have malicious intent, they\u2019d leak that on Twitter and 2 million people would know it in 7 minutes. So the space-time functioning of Bitcoin is important. You don\u2019t want it to move fast. This is why if you read the Blocksize Wars, a lot of maneuvering back and forth but at the end of the day, the immediate a priori observation is that they shouldn\u2019t have tried to change anything. It was a mistake to try to change the blocksize. It\u2019s a mistake to try to change the frequency. Why? Because when you create a crypto-universe or a crypto-creature, the block size and the frequency of the network are akin to the space-time constants of the universe. It\u2019s like trying to change the gravitational constant and the speed of light. You don\u2019t get to play God except once. You can play God once. If Satoshi had designed the network with 1.2mb blocks and 8-minute frequency it might have worked. And there\u2019s some parameters that wouldn\u2019t have worked. But once he started it and it started to spin then you don\u2019t change it, because the size of the blocksize is kind of like the packing density of carbon molecules. It\u2019s like, if you were to change the speed of light or the gravitational constant, let\u2019s say you changed the gravity on the surface of the Earth. Let\u2019s say we made it 3x what it is right now? What happens to every creature, every bridge, every building, every plant, every factory? What happens when I crank up the gravitational constant by a factor of 3?"}

What happens? Every building and everything built up until now collapses, i.e. all work is negated. Not just work by mankind \u2014 work by animals, work by mother nature, rivers, mountains collapse, bridges collapse, companies collapse, countries collapse. So you would negate all past work, you would imperil or impair all structures. You would impair or destroy all machinery constructed. Any machine that works would stop working. And you would throw the future to chaos. And it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re playing God, right? Change the speed of light \u2014 the same thing\u2019s going to happen. The Reynolds number determines the hull speed of a ship. Change the Reynolds number, change the way that molecules move around a hydrofoil. Nothing works. Some things sink. At best, everything just gets destroyed, commerce collapses. So when you think about it like that, you come back to the crypto-universe, you say, Okay you created a crypto, you set the space-time parameters. Now the future of mining is based on that blocksize and that frequency. Change the blocksize, change the forecast of the mining revenue, change the expectations of every investor, change every business decision, invalidate all business decisions. At some point the foolishness of doubling the blocksize \u2014 which is what the big blockers wanted to do \u2014 if they had doubled the blocksize over and over again they would have driven the transaction fees to zero. When transaction fees go to zero the revenue of the Bitcoin mining business is dramatically changed. Now there\u2019s no future revenue model. Now you have miners lobbying to change the block reward. You would basically bankrupt the mining business, screw it all up, and then you\u2019ve got no security network because I can\u2019t afford to actually secure the network. So they were imaging a world where everything had to be on the base layer, and they\u2019re monkeying with the base layer. And instead what they should have seen is that the world is in layers. The key is: the base layer of Bitcoin is like the granite underlying Manhattan. You never needed it to be lighter. If somebody said, I have an idea: let\u2019s turn the granite in Manhattan into cotton candy! It\u2019ll taste better. It\u2019s like, Are you an idiot? If you turn all of Manhattan into cotton candy all the buildings are going to sink, we\u2019re all going to die in a cotton candy swamp. You know it\u2019s so silly like we\u2019re laughing, but the point is\u2014But the granite\u2019s heavy and it\u2019s hard for me to move and it\u2019s slow and the transaction fees for moving granite around are high \u2014 Yes! You\u2019re not supposed to move the granite! You\u2019re supposed to build on top of the granite. And the same is true with the base layer. You\u2019re not supposed to move the base layer. The point of the base layer is to be here 1,000 years from now, right? Yeah you can wave your arm and convert the granite into sand or into mud and you can move it. You can shovel it out of the way with your little toy shovel from the seashore from when you were a kid, but the point is: you can\u2019t build a city that\u2019s going to last 1,000 years on mud and on sand. And if you have an understanding of the universe, the universe is layers and layers, and the consequences of the speed of sound is everything that flies through the air. And the consequences of the speed of light is everything in the universe. And the consequence of the gravitational constant is how the water flows and how the mountains move. And once you understand those things you can build everything. Everything that humanity has done in the history of the human race is predicated on those space-time constants being what they were. And when you decide to routinely change them you\u2019re playing God. And when you play God you pretty much destroy everything that came before and throw into chaos everything that comes afterwards after leveling every building and leaving a trail of wreckage in the present day. It\u2019s like an earthquake except it\u2019s worse than an earthquake. It\u2019s like a continual rolling, randomized series of different earthquakes every second. And that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to screw with that."}

Well do we need a speed of sound? Yeah! You need a speed of sound. What if we made the speed of sound equal to the speed of light? Not a good idea. If you want the universe to work \u2014 what if we got rid of friction? The transaction fees are too high, let\u2019s take them to zero. Well that\u2019s the same as saying, Let\u2019s get rid of friction. And let\u2019s get rid of gravity. Well getting rid of friction and gravity is a problem because pretty much everything we\u2019ve created works with it. How about your tires without friction? How well is your car going to drive without friction? They\u2019re not bad things. In the defense of the big blockers, the Lightning Network was not as manifestly clear today, but all you have to do is look at a Lightning wallet and a Lightning transaction and look at a layer 2 and a layer 3 transaction \u2014 look at how Square Cash App works, look at how Muun works \u2014 I can send 1,000 sats in 1 second for 1 sat.

Look, proof of work is an open, competitive, natural system. It emulates Darwinian competition. And it\u2019s open. Proof of stake is a closed, controlled system. So the problem with a closed, controlled system is it\u2019s not Darwinian and there\u2019s no genetic diversity. It becomes inbred. So let\u2019s take a shoreline \u2014 a living shoreline. If you\u2019re trying to actually maintain such a thing. The way they engineer it is, you would create 200-foot long revetments and you would put a break in it for the seawater to come in, and then you create another revetment to protect the shore from the surf, but you always have to have a break for seawater to come in. If you don\u2019t leave that channel for seawater to come in, then the water behind the revetment becomes putrid. You ever seen a putrid standing body of water without circulation? It breeds bacteria, it becomes infested, it becomes dangerous, it\u2019s not healthy. And why? It\u2019s closed. It\u2019s a closed system. All cities, all civilizations \u2014 why do you build a city on a river? Because you need something to carry the waste away. What happens if you recirculate your waste in your own [inaudible 38:19]? How long can you recirculate the waste in your space suit? How long can you recirculate the water and the waste in your apartment? Well proof of stake is recirculating itself and the problem there is, unless you have perfect components and you have perfect conditions, at some point either the toxicity of the closed environment destroys the ecosystem, or it becomes so fragile because of the lack of Darwinian competition and the lack of ecological genetic diversity that eventually it dies. It\u2019s like a creature endlessly cloning itself. After you endlessly clone yourself you\u2019re subject to genetic mutations and defects. That\u2019s why every organic creature has sex, right? You actually want to keep mixing the DNA in order to avoid the mutated defects. And you can\u2019t cleanse yourself. You can\u2019t fix the species if you close the system."}

And coming back to the other elephant in the room here: Bitcoin is a successful proof of work network that has created our first digital money, our first digital property. Bitcoin has done that. We can see that. There are no successful examples of a proof of stake network succeeding as digital property. That\u2019s the elephant in the room. There are no successful proof of stake networks. What would be required to be successful? Well here\u2019s a simple one: if the United States government designated a proof of stake network as property and not a security. It\u2019s never happened. In fact the head of the SEC just went on television and said, If there\u2019s an ICO and there\u2019s a shared enterprise with intent to profit then it\u2019s a security. So as far as I can see every proof of stake network that\u2019s been launched looks to be by legal definition a security, not property. And even Ethereum isn\u2019t a proof of stake network, so there\u2019s a debate about whether it is property or not, and that\u2019ll eventually be resolved. But there\u2019s absolutely no question that at this point the only successful digital property that\u2019s ever been created in the history of the world was created on a proof of work network. There\u2019s nothing else. Everything else is just like a garage-science experiment or a venture experiment. And on the surface they all appear to be securities. I mean none of them has successfully decentralized or been embraced as property. And it\u2019s not clear whether they can successfully decentralize. I mean, theoretically new things are possible, but practically speaking we have one example of crypto-property or crypto-money, and that is Bitcoin. And everything else is a speculation."}

But they have obligations to disclose the number of those such tokens to their shareholders and it\u2019s illegal for them to act in a duplicitous unethical fashion.

I\u2019ve called it the seven layers of security, but I think we should start with a fundamental observation: what we\u2019re trying to create with Bitcoin is a digital property network. Something that will last for 1,000 years or 10,000 years. How do I create digital property in cyberspace? And we can call it money if we like \u2014 digital monetary network or digital property network. But what I want is I want a decentralized network that will last past the average life expectancy of a human being, or an institution, or a nation-state. So how do I do that? Well the beauty of proof of work is that the network derives its integrity from the interplay of the miners and the nodes and the HODLers, or the wallets if you will. With an especial emphasis on the miners. What do I define a security? Well property needs to be optimized for integrity and durability over time, integrity meaning the protocol can\u2019t be corrupted. It can\u2019t mutate. If the protocol mutates we go from 21 million to 48 million, you get a monstrosity. So you don\u2019t want a mutation. And then I don\u2019t want it to die. So if I said I want to design an immortal creature, something that will live for a million years, and I want it to maintain its integrity, then I\u2019ve got to protect the protocol, and then I\u2019ve also got to feed it energy and resources continually, and I have to protect it from a hostile attack in the near-term. Sometimes we think about security we think just about avoiding an attack, but really security is: you can\u2019t [be attacked] in the near-term, we don\u2019t want it to die, and most importantly, if you live but you go insane or you get a grotesque mutation, then did you really live? So how am I going to achieve my quest for immortality in a network? And the beauty of proof of work is it is an open protocol that is Darwinian and competitive in a way such that it is not just self-correcting on the protocol level to ensure correct money, but it\u2019s also self-healing and it\u2019s adaptive to the environment around it. I like to call these the seven layers of security, so what do you have? You have: an energy layer, a technology layer, a political layer, a financial layer, a network layer, a spatial layer, and a temporal layer of energy. Those seven various dimensions. So I\u2019ll start with the first dimension of security: energy. I have a hashrate \u2014 say we\u2019ve got 100 exahash right now. Well I\u2019ve got to feed it energy in order to create the 100 exahash. Bitcoin is a big customer of energy. In fact it turns out that Bitcoin is the most valuable, most compelling industrial customer of energy in the world right now. You can generate about 40 cents per kilowatt-hour in revenue mining Bitcoin. So that makes it interesting because that co-opts all the energy industry. So one way that Bitcoin spreads and stays organically vital is it forms partnerships with the energy industry. If you have a volcano in the middle of Central America, the value of that energy sold within 500 miles of you is like 1 penny a kilowatt-hour. Unless you sell it to Bitcoin, and it\u2019s 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. So Bitcoin is the best customer for your volcano. Bitcoin is a customer of stranded energy, intermittent energy, energy on any frequency, and energy at any scale. And you don\u2019t need to be co-located with an industrial customer or a consumer. And you don\u2019t need bandwidth. So for example, What\u2019s the second-best use of energy? Maybe like running Netflix or Google data centers? But if you want to run a Google data center, you need to be within a fiber-optic distance of the major switching networks because you\u2019re streaming video and streaming a lot of high-bandwidth queries. So they\u2019re bandwidth-intensive, and they need to be triple-redundant because they can\u2019t fail. If you\u2019re trying to operate a car with Google Maps, you can\u2019t afford to have an outage in the network. So Bitcoin miners are so much better than a typical data center because you could monetize the entire volcano or you could monetize the entire waterfall or the entire nuclear reactor \u2014 the full bandwidth of it. You could do it at the North Pole. You could do it with a satellite up-link. And you could monetize intermittent energy coming off of wind or wave or solar. And you can also shut it down in a heartbeat with fairly low economic cost. So that makes Bitcoin the most compelling technology for the energy industry that\u2019s come along this decade \u2014 maybe in a long time. The last big energy technology was aluminum, when people would use their excess energy to smelt aluminum. Well Bitcoin re-built that but in spades. To do Bitcoin you don\u2019t need a port to ship aluminum in and out of. You don\u2019t need an aluminum factory which is difficult. You don\u2019t need aluminum ore. And you also don\u2019t need the industrial demand for aluminum, which eventually saturates. Aluminum is a specialty metal. So what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is money! So half of everything that the human race is Bitcoin, or will be Bitcoin in time. So Bitcoin mining is securing and producing something which is of enormous value on a very thin line based upon any flavor and frequency of energy, and there\u2019s really nothing like that. Why does that make the network secure? Well Bitcoin miners are continually looking for new energy sources and they\u2019re negotiating for cheap energy, and when they buy it they become a big customer. So as they become customers of energy producers everywhere in the world, the energy producers become political allies of Bitcoin. So the energy producers are all regulated entities, but they\u2019re all very credible, and they\u2019re all wired into the political fabric of every society. So if you are the best customer of the utility in the city or the state or the country, then that utility has the vested interest in protecting your interest. So Bitcoin co-opts energy companies, and also Bitcoin is hope for a utility. If you are a value stock 100-year old utility company, you\u2019re not getting a high multiple in the stock market, there\u2019s not a lot of excitement. In fact you\u2019re regulated and there are limits on how much money you can make by selling your energy to consumers or to businesses. If the power company in New York City just jacked the price of energy by a factor of three they would get shut down by the regulators. On the other hand, if you get into the Bitcoin mining business, you don\u2019t have those kind of regulations on you. So Bitcoin is a chance for energy companies to become technology companies, and it solves so many of their problems. I can generate more revenue\u2014check. I can generate revenue at much higher price per kilowatt-hour \u2014 it\u2019s a very high price customer. The value and use of electricity for Bitcoin miners is higher than any other customer they have, so that\u2019s good \u2014 check. It\u2019s portable. And so that means every place I\u2019ve got stranded energy production facilities I can move the Bitcoin mine to the energy \u2014 check, that\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s an energy shock-absorber. If I have a renewable energy network say with wind and solar, what I want to do is I want to build it to the level of peak demand, but if I build at the level of peak demand I will over-build it by a factor of two or more, and that means I\u2019ll be running at 50% utilization for my consumer and other industrial customers. So how am I going to find a customer that\u2019s willing to actually take up half of my energy production and then turn off for 10, 20 hours a year when there\u2019s a brown-out without complaining? Like, the hospital\u2019s not going to do that. Homes aren\u2019t going to do that. So I need some kind of industrial producer that becomes a shock-absorber \u2014 they\u2019re going to drive up my utilization to 98% and then when I brown out they\u2019re going to turn off and give back energy to the network. So Bitcoin represents a driver for the development of sustainable and renewable energy, it also represents a technology to provide more reliability and fault-tolerance to a power grid. If you think about the role of capacitors or batteries or shock-absorbers in electrical or mechanical machines, that\u2019s what Bitcoin is for a power network."}

So you\u2019ve described money as energy, socio-political energy. So in that framework I guess we could consider banks historically where they were actually providing custody of gold, they were kind of like energy stores in a way \u2014 we\u2019re storing this excess productive economic energy in gold that banks were custodying for us. And now with Bitcoin we have this more direct path to monetizing energy, and so an interesting thing here \u2014 you\u2019ve heard about a power bank, these little devices that will charge your phone that stores energy. So it\u2019s like banks and power banks \u2014 do you see the energy producers and banks somehow converging? Because it seems like on a Bitcoin standard you eliminate the need for a custodial bank, they become kind of synonymous with energy producers. Do you see those industries coming together in the future?"}

It\u2019s encrypting the energy from electrical energy into monetary energy. And so on one hand it\u2019s upgrading the raw physical energy through the encryption process, and then on the other hand it\u2019s digitally transforming analog fiat energy into encrypted money \u2014 digital money. And that makes Bitcoin a bank, an energy bank, a monetary bank. It makes it the world\u2019s greatest battery, right? You could look at it from two angles: banks are bleeding off 1% of your energy a month due to inflation. Batteries are bleeding off 1% of your electrical energy a month just due to battery engineering. You\u2019ve got two inefficient energy systems: batteries and power grids don\u2019t work that well, and fiat banks and monetary grids don\u2019t work that well. And Bitcoin plus Lightning gives you a battery to store all the world\u2019s energy forever without power loss. The other day I sent 1,000 sats on the Lightning Network in 1 second for 1 sat. So literally you\u2019ve got speed of light, nearly \u2014 you know, what is the cost of 1 sat, it\u2019s such an infinitesimally small number, a fraction of a fraction of a penny \u2014 so Bitcoin\u2019s a very efficient energy system. I think that the significance here is that Bitcoin is disruptive technology for the entire energy market, and it\u2019s co-opting the energy producers and energy investors into Bitcoin. What you see right now is you see a lot of traditional power companies that used to be in the energy business, they\u2019re getting into Bitcoin mining. People with natural gas, people in the nuclear industry, people in the wind and solar industry \u2014 they\u2019re getting into Bitcoin mining or they\u2019re partnering with Bitcoin mines. So Bitcoin recruited energy capital, and Bitcoin secures the network with energy capital. Hundreds and hundreds of producers of energy are plugged into the Bitcoin network creating that hash wall. So that\u2019s the first layer of security for Bitcoin. And if you\u2019re going to attack it, it\u2019s no small feat to go and collect that much energy. You almost can\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to collect twice as much energy, or as much energy as is currently in the Bitcoin mining network. Politically, economically, practically, I just don\u2019t know how you\u2019d do it, right? Very, very problematic. And there\u2019s no short-cut. In that regard, there\u2019s an energy wall and you have to jump over it. And it\u2019s a lot, to the point where you\u2019re talking about 100 terawatt-hours of energy or something. It\u2019s a lot of energy. So the second layer though is technology. And this I don\u2019t think people really understand that well and when I talk about technology I\u2019m referring to Bitcoin ASIC miners. Bitcoin is a wall of encrypted energy, so the energy is the first part, but the encrypting, the encryption, the crypto is the second part \u2014 the crypto-wall of energy. It\u2019s not raw energy. If it was raw energy you just need 100 terawatt-hours to start to get parity. But when it\u2019s encrypted energy, I need 100 exahash of SHA-256 mining equipment, and since it\u2019s like 10,000 miners to get to an exahash right now, then that\u2019s a million mining rigs of the latest build \u2014 how do you come up with a million mining rigs? It\u2019s like, no one\u2019s got a million mining rigs sitting around. It\u2019s not clear how long it would take to manufacture a million mining rigs. Bitcoin\u2019s co-opting technology companies. So Bitmain is a big player, but there are other big players too, and as Bitcoin gets larger, I think you\u2019ll see the Intels of the world and you\u2019ll see other semi-conductor companies designing Bitcoin mining rigs and getting into the space. And this is another example where this is open and competitive. Who wants it the most? Whoever wants it \u2014 and what capital do you need? This is semi-conductor fabrication capital. You have to fabricate these ASICs. The S19 family is five times more efficient than the S9s. So if you wanted to generate an exahash on the S9 family, it took 150 megawatts of power \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of power. If you wanted to do it with S19s it\u2019s 30 megawatts of power. A 5x difference in a generation. If you get through two generations every 10 years \u2014 or three, right? \u2014 you\u2019re talking about a 20x improvement. I mean we\u2019re 100x more technically efficient today than we were 8 years ago. Where will we be in 10 more years? We go back and forth \u2014 there\u2019s all sorts of people with opinions. There\u2019s Moore\u2019s Law, some people think that ASIC technology efficiency will slow down, but then again people have been predicting that we would hit a wall in Moore\u2019s Law for a while and they\u2019re still not quite right. So when you understand the Bitcoin network, what you can think is that the Bitcoin mining network 10 years ago was very energy-intensive and technology-poor. There was a time when you were just using off-the-shelf chips, and then you were using GPUs, and then you were using ASIC first generation, and then ASIC next generation. So we\u2019re like five generations into this now. In the early time-frame, you threw probably 1,000x if not a million times as much energy to generate a hash. And now you\u2019re throwing 30 megawatts to generate an exahash. But when we get to the next generation it\u2019ll be 5 megawatts. Well what if we get to 1 megawatt? So as you go out, energy is still important, but it turns out that the network is rotating from energy-intensive security to technology-intensive security. What if you imagine one day there will be 10 million mining rigs but they\u2019ll be seventh-generation ASICs and they will be a hundred times more efficient than anything we have today? What that means is that 99% of the hashpower will come from that generation of mining rigs, which means that all this stuff that we have today becomes 1% of the network, right? Which means it gets squeezed out of the ecosystem. All those miners that are obsolete go out of business. And so that technology intensity has a couple of dynamics: 1) that\u2019s what keeps the network from consuming all the energy in the world. I mean, people say silly things like, Oh well the energy usage is going to increase with the price. Well no it\u2019s not. The energy usage maybe will increase with the log of the price. That is, if the price goes up by a factor of 10, energy usage might go up by a factor of 2. And if price goes up by a factor of 100, energy usage might go up by a factor or 3 or 4. But what you\u2019ve got is a situation where the halvings are cutting the block reward in half every 4 years, so that\u2019s a built-in 5x improvement in efficiency every decade, and then if you crank over that another 10x improvement in hardware, you\u2019re talking about a 50x improvement in tech efficiency in a decade, or a 50x50x in 20 years. So the price has got to go way up, and even so, what you\u2019ve got is a rotation: the network is rotating from, I burn a lot of energy to generate my hashes to, I burn less energy, to I burn less energy to generate more hashes. It\u2019s not hard to see this, right? It\u2019s in your iPhone: your iPhone has more processing power than the space shuttle had 40 years ago. You\u2019ve got a supercomputer in your pocket, so you\u2019ve got to assume that the security chips that generate the hashes just keep getting better. And because Bitcoin is unique in the protocol, all of the other processing power is irrelevant, right? Bitcoin is a Darwinian competition to generate the SHA-256 hashes. And it\u2019s 95% dominant in that game right now. There\u2019s a few other crypto-networks that use that but they\u2019re like 1\u20132%. So that uniqueness with regard to the proof of work protocol protects it from an attack from all of the AWS network or all of the Google network or if everybody turned their iPhones to Bitcoin mining it wouldn\u2019t help them that much, right?"}

People think, Well 60% of the miners\u2019 costs are going to energy. Well actually the miners are spending money on energy, and then they\u2019re spending money on semi-conductor mining rigs, and then they\u2019re spending money on the mining centers themselves. The heat sink, the heat engineer and the generators and the like. So there\u2019s a competition. The question is: are you better off having inefficient miners and cheap power? Or are you better off having efficient miners and expensive power?"}

That was my next question. So the new generation miners go to the more expensive energy sources, and then the older generations roll off to cheaper energy sources and they both operate side-by-side?"}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim056-the-saylor-series-episode-14-bitcoins-seven-layers-of-security-1", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 14 | Bitcoin\u2019s Seven Layers of Security #1", "text": "Michael Saylor 27:59\nYeah well you\u2019ve got three generations of miners. People are running old, inefficient miners in China on free power, and then in the US and North America publicly-traded companies are buying the latest-generation expensive miners because their power is more expensive but they have more capital. If I have $500 million in capital, spend $60 million to buy 10,000 S19s, mine 1 exahash on 30 megawatts and make $120 million a year. Good deal? Probably a good deal, right? So in that case you would rather buy the better equipment. I think you find at any given time there\u2019s like three generations of mining equipment. When the price goes high, if you look at the hashrate of the network back in the first quarter, there was a point when the hashrate got to like 190 or something, and I thought the peak was 170 but there was a surge up by about 10\u201315 exahash and I posit that that surge was because people turned on third-generation mining equipment, like the oldest, least-efficient stuff. And there\u2019s a relationship: an S19 is generating 40 cents a kilowatt-hour right now. Ergo, it is profitable to buy electricity up to 39 cents a kilowatt-hour. An S9 was 5x more inefficient, so S9s were profitable at 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. But if you go back one generation before that, if you\u2019re 5x less efficient than that you\u2019re profitable at 1.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. So the break-even point is a function of the semi-conductor, or the joules per terahash. And that\u2019s a technology driver, it\u2019s not an energy driver. And most of the people that model Bitcoin mining, they don\u2019t really focus upon the technical efficiency of the miners. And by miner I don\u2019t just mean the one mining rig, I just mean the mining operator that has a mixture of first generation, second generation, third generation equipment. And you may turn off \u2014 like if the price of Bitcoin went to $5,000 a coin right now, people would probably turn off the old mining equipment unless the energy was free, right? You can bootleg Bitcoin on free energy if you\u2019re stealing the energy. But if the energy costs 3 cents a kilowatt-hour you\u2019re going to turn off your old equipment, you\u2019re going to keep the new equipment running. And that\u2019s an adaptive correcting system itself. When the price goes up you\u2019re going to turn on the old equipment. And over time though, these are transient phenomena because the more important phenomena to focus on is that over a decade, the technical efficiency of the mining network is going to increase by a factor of 20x\u2013100x depending upon the rate at which people upgrade the semi-conductors. There are a lot of ways that you can enter into the network and you can disrupt the equilibrium. One way as a nation-state is you can start mining off of a volcano. The other way you can design a totally new family of ASICs. Maybe Intel or Apple wants to get in the space \u2014 they could disrupt it. A big energy producer could disrupt it. Right now the limiting factor is the number of mining rigs you can get your hands on \u2014 that\u2019s good. That creates some predictability to it. And that keeps us from going chaotic. So if you look at these two layers of security, the energy layer is co-opting energy providers all around the world, and the technology dimension is co-opting semi-conducting manufacturers. And if one of them like Bitmain gets too much power, you know Jeff Bezos\u2019s famous line, Your margin is my opportunity. So if one company gets too much power then well this is not that terribly complicated engineering. It\u2019s well-understood how to design SHA-256 ASICs."}

And there are a lot of companies like Qualcomm, Intel, when they get squeezed they need a new market \u2014 this is the new market for them as the price goes up. And the interesting thing of course is: if there\u2019s only one provider of SHA-256 miners \u2014 Bitmain \u2014 doesn\u2019t that create an artificial scarcity to hashrate? And if there is a scarcity to hashrate, the profitability of Bitcoin miners goes up, right? And so if the profitability of Bitcoin miners goes up, then don\u2019t more people want to get into the business? And if more people want to get into the business, don\u2019t they need to buy Bitcoin mining rigs? And if they need to buy it and there\u2019s infinite money, don\u2019t they go and find someone else to go break that monopoly? So energy and technology are a key part of the equation. But they\u2019re not the only part of the equation, because if I want to generate hashes I have to set up a Bitcoin mining facility. There\u2019s physical nexus \u2014 I have to do it in Iceland or El Salvador or Canada or Texas. And you could probably run your stake validator on a secret machine in your basement, but you can\u2019t run a 150 megawatt facility \u2014 you\u2019d need the support of the mayor, the county, the governor. You could look at this as a negative \u2014 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s a positive. What it means is that Bitcoin miners are knocking on doors everywhere in the universe and they\u2019re looking for supportive political jurisdictions. If New York City doesn\u2019t want to mine Bitcoin, maybe Texas does. Maybe Florida does. Maybe Wyoming does, right? And so if China doesn\u2019t, well then maybe Kazakhstan does. In fact, the more irrational one country is, the more appealing Bitcoin mining is to the others. When China actually cracked down on Bitcoin mining, the revenues of Bitcoin miners doubled. The profits quadrupled. And the incentive to get in the mining business jumped. So what you have is an interesting dynamic where Bitcoin miners partner with energy companies, and they partner with technology companies, but they also partner with political jurisdictions and politicians. And this is an interesting situation too because this is so Darwinian: what happens if you\u2019re a Bitcoin miner and you set up a billion dollar Bitcoin mining rig in New York York and there\u2019s a new mayor and he outlaws Bitcoin mining? What happens to your capital? You can\u2019t move it, right? So Bitcoin miners have skin in the game. And because they have skin in the game, that means that they have to do their due diligence and they\u2019ve got a long time-horizon. A person that\u2019s mining Bitcoin is looking out 5 years, looking out 10 years. You kind of want to be in a jurisdiction where you think that a decade from now you\u2019ll still be able to mine Bitcoin, and so it forces you to be more thoughtful. And the next step is, Well I just invest hundreds of millions of dollars in this county, I guess I probably better contribute to the county election and get the mayor elected, right? You put down roots, because you have a vested interest. Because you have something to lose. So the Bitcoin mining network actually becomes a politically lobbying network for Bitcoin. And then every politician that has a Bitcoin mine has tax revenue. You know, when New York wanted to ban Bitcoin mining, that was blocked by a politician because the politician got a letter from the union, and the union said, We\u2019re going to lose jobs. So all the money that flows into creating mining centers creates jobs, creates tax revenue, supports politicians, creates massive revenues for engineering companies, for real estate companies, for landlords, etc. It\u2019s good for the local economy. Bitcoin brings prosperity anywhere on Earth. You might be a limousine liberal in the upper-east side and not like the use of electricity. On the other hand, but if you\u2019re living in the middle of central Africa and if you have a volcano or if you have a waterfall and 90% of your population is living below the poverty level and there is no industry and someone shows up and offers to give you billions of dollars if they can attach a turbine to your waterfall \u2014 how do you feel about the situation?"}

Netflix is not going to show up in El Salvador and offer them $300 million a year in order to run a data center plugged into a volcano. Google is not going to show up in Zambia central Africa and offer them $300 million a year to run a Google data center. It\u2019s not going to happen. So what you have is Bitcoin is hope for energy, it is hope for your semi-conductor company, it is hope for your political jurisdiction, it solves a problem, and because it can go anywhere on Earth with a satellite uplink, it\u2019s probably a more compelling solution to someone that has natural resources in a poor country even than in a wealthy country. And what you end up with is a self-distributing dynamically distributing Bitcoin mining network, and it has solved for the problem, Where do I find the cheapest energy in a politically supportive jurisdiction? That\u2019s the problem you\u2019re solving for them. That\u2019s not the same as the cheapest energy. It has to be cheap energy from an energy provider you trust, in a political jurisdiction you trust. Okay well what\u2019s the answer? The answer is that it\u2019s a dynamic equilibrium. It\u2019s changing every single week. It was different 3 years ago. 3 years ago there was free electricity in provinces that had empty excess coal electricity capacity in China, and so you could get effectively free energy. Okay, it was free but it wasn\u2019t politically stable. Now you can go to a politically-stable place like Texas and get it for 3 cents. Or maybe you can get it for 1 penny in Kazakhstan, or maybe you can go some other random place. You could go to Cuba or you can get a bootleg thing in the jungle from some warlord. For how long? Well the Bitcoin mining network is continually distributing itself, and it\u2019s organic. It\u2019s just like asking the question, When we settle around the Earth, where should we settle where we\u2019ll be able to make a living and we won\u2019t suffer from famine or a tornado? And the answer is: you don\u2019t know! Until you\u2019ve lived 100 years you don\u2019t know that place floods. What\u2019s the likelihood of an earthquake in your favorite place? Well you\u2019ll find out. So what happens? Well the network distributes itself, some people make good choices, some people make unwise choices. This goes back to antifragile or the like. You make really awful choices you\u2019ll probably be put out of business within 36 months. If you make okay choices you might last 3\u201310 years. And then maybe there are other choices where you\u2019ll be good for 100 years. But maybe you\u2019re better off to go to the place where you\u2019re good for 6 years where the energy is 1 penny instead of the place where you\u2019re good for 100 years where the energy is 5 pennies. And maybe we could debate it. And maybe you have an opinion and we could argue until the cows come home, but what does it matter? It\u2019s better to just release the entire creature, let the entire world work in a Darwinian, Adam Smith evolutionary fashion, a competitive way, and the lesson of the markets is that the market is smarter than anybody. Every time I think about what I knew, half the time I thought I knew it and I was wrong and sometimes I was right, but the market generally outsmarts the smartest person. So Bitcoin mining is a dynamic market in security and it\u2019s balancing energy versus technology versus political support. And that takes us to the fourth layer of security \u2014"}

It\u2019s a shock-absorber. It is stabilizing. It\u2019s a political shock-absorber and it\u2019s an energy shock absorber. If you have a political regime and you\u2019ve got natural resources but your economy is tanked, Bitcoin comes in \u2014 on one hand the Bitcoin miner can generate $500 million a year in revenue\u2014Okay. On the other hand the Bitcoin miner can say we\u2019re not coming unless we actually feel this is a stable regime to operate in. You know how there\u2019s that phrase, I got married and my wife made me want to be a better man. It\u2019s like, Okay well if you get married you have to give up some of your bachelor ways, right? And if you have a child you have to be even more responsible. So the commitment to a family is stabilizing, because you\u2019re thinking, I can\u2019t do the crazy things I did when I had no other responsibilities. If you don\u2019t actually have any industry you have nothing to lose. And so a country that has a Bitcoin mine has something to gain and something to lose, and if you were to actually seize the Bitcoin mine, no other Bitcoin miners are coming to you, right? It\u2019s the same as seizing the Bitcoin. If you make Bitcoin illegal in your country and you make mining illegal then you lose all that. But if you make Bitcoin legal or welcome and you make mining welcome you gain something. And then if you\u2019re rational you might remember that your prosperity came from the new job you had, and then that way you don\u2019t want to lose the job. If you\u2019re jobless and homeless, well first of all there\u2019s nothing to lose, and then if someone puts a $37 revolver in front of you maybe that\u2019s more appealing to you to use that. If I had nothing I might be more prone to violence. And then why do people resort to violence? Maybe because it\u2019s hopeless? If I feel like things are hopeless I either kill myself or I kill somebody else. Bitcoin is hope, and so yeah it is politically stabilizing, because it\u2019s a way out for someone that can\u2019t find another way out, and once you adopt Bitcoin you see something that worked, and you have something to lose, and you\u2019re part of the multi-national Bitcoin network and that is civilizing in its own special way. Because after the mining it draws you into Bitcoin HODLing and then Bitcoin banking and then Bitcoin commerce and Bitcoin philosophy and the like."}

Where should we start, Michael?"}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim053-the-saylor-series-episode-13-bitcoin-is-cybernetic-life", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 13 | Bitcoin is Cybernetic Life", "text": "Michael Saylor 2:08\nYou know, Bitcoin is its own self-contained monetary system and the Bitcoin system is replacing the fiat system. So I think a good place to start is exploring the way that we did everything in the 20th century with the fiat system and then comparing the implications when you switch to the Bitcoin system. In essence, What\u2019s the difference between an analog monetary system and a digital monetary system? And I find it helpful to try to model the two. So if someone said to me, What is Bitcoin doing? Well Bitcoin is dematerializing the accountants, the auditors, the compliance function, the information technology function, the human resources function, the security function, the facilities function, the police force, the military, the function of war, and the function of politics \u2014 all of those things are dematerializing and they\u2019re collapsing into the Bitcoin network. And so on one side, the 20th century \u2014 if you want to operate a business like I\u2019m a publicly traded business, I need accountants. And every three months we close our books. Every three months. The gold standard of business operations is you close your books quarterly and you have finance people and accountants that do the book close. And I\u2019ve been a public company officer for like 22 years so I\u2019ve done 88 quarterly closes \u2014 actually more than that. Well Bitcoin closes the books every 10 minutes, right? So you\u2019ve got an accounting function but instead of a quarterly close you have a 10-minute close. So then you have this other issue which is that in my world \u2014 the public company world \u2014 after you close the books you have auditors. So the auditors look at the books to verify that they\u2019ve been properly closed and they sign off on your quarterly results and then there\u2019s a 10-K where they sign off on the books at the end of the year. The audit process is manual and expensive in the fiat world. In the Bitcoin world you\u2019ve kind of got triple-entry bookkeeping \u2014 not double-entry but triple-entry \u2014 because the books get burned cryptographically and they\u2019re truly closed. They\u2019re closed with an encryption whereas the books of a public company they\u2019re kind of open and then they sort of closed, with a private company they never quite close \u2014 you can never be quite sure. And you\u2019ve got manual accountants and manual auditors. And so those two functions matter a lot, but then the third function, if you look at the conventional bank or any kind of fiat bank, you\u2019ve got a compliance function. And the compliance function is to make sure that you didn\u2019t enter in any kind of transactions which are illegal or non-compliant or not permissible. You can\u2019t enter into any inappropriate transaction. That compliance sometimes comes after the transactions are entered into. You see with like Archegos where you had UBS write off billions and billions of dollars. Well they entered into some non-compliant transactions where they took risks they shouldn\u2019t take, and they found out after the fact and the cost was billions of dollars to their shareholders. Well Bitcoin solves that compliance issue with the nodes that are verifying transactions are compliant and you\u2019ve got like six verifications before you\u2019re sure it\u2019s compliant. On the first verification it\u2019s sort of compliant. But the assurance of the compliance comes from from the mining plus the nodes themselves, and it\u2019s 100% \u2014 what is it 99.999999% certain after like the sixth confirmation \u2014 so you\u2019ve got an automated process which is distributed which is almost incorruptible. Whereas compliance in the fiat banking world is a manual process\u2014and you\u2019re not even checking compliance of every transaction, right? In Bitcoin you\u2019ve got 100% compliance by the time you\u2019ve got six verifications down, which is 60-minutes. Well you could be 6 months after closing a quarter in a publicly traded company or at a bank \u2014 think about your credit card company. You\u2019re Mastercard or you\u2019re Visa and you\u2019re doing all of these transactions \u2014 what percentage of them are 100% compliant, and when? In fact you could be six months after the quarter closes and you would still have lots and lots of non-compliant transactions they passed through the system. And that\u2019s fraud, and the economy pays the price on that. You go to the next level \u2014 IT \u2014 a bank or a money transfer agent in the fiat world has a big IT department and a bunch of data centers. Whereas in the Bitcoin world the miners and the nodes \u2014 that is the IT infrastructure. So it\u2019s completely decentralized and self-maintaining and self-healing. And it\u2019s continually upgrading itself through the process of mining. Whereas the banks, they have to have an IT department and an IT budget and they have to continually invest in this or they become obsolete. So the fiat bank also has a human resources department. You have to hire people to order the equipment, to configure the equipment, to upgrade the equipment, to do the compliance, to do the accounting, to do the transactions. Well Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a human resources department, because there are no employees. You\u2019ve kind of dematerialized it. Why is that interesting? If there\u2019s no human resources department there\u2019s nobody to quit, right? There\u2019s no one to fire, there\u2019s no one to complain, there\u2019s no one to harass, because there isn\u2019t a human resources department at all. So you can see we have taken all of these human factors and we have dematerialized them into the protocol and the decentralized hardware which is continually being upgraded \u2014 unless it isn\u2019t! And if it isn\u2019t upgraded \u2014 if you\u2019re running a node and you don\u2019t upgrade you fall out of consensus and you just get sloughed off the network. And if you\u2019re a miner and you\u2019re running on four-generation old mining equipment then you become 100x more inefficient and then you can\u2019t mine any more Bitcoin and you get pushed off the network. And if you\u2019re running a miner and you don\u2019t pay your electricity bill you get pushed off the network. So the network is self-healing, self-sealing, self-upgrading in the Bitcoin world. Whereas in the fiat banking world it requires human intervention to do all these things. So \u2014 complicated, we\u2019re doing it \u2014 what\u2019s the next step? Well, security. In a real bank I\u2019ve got to have security professionals. I\u2019ve got all sorts of IT security, physical security, people with guns, people hiring and training the people with guns, etc., and I\u2019ve got to worry about someone hacking into that security system. As long as there\u2019s someone responsible then you have to worry about that person. But in Bitcoin the security is intrinsic to the network, it\u2019s basically built into the protocol. It\u2019s making itself more secure. And then we get to facilities. The fiat bank has to go and have a facility in the middle of New York City and they\u2019ve got a landlord and they\u2019ve got a lease and they\u2019re paying money and they\u2019re paying taxes on the facility. The facility in Bitcoin in essence becomes the mining rigs wherever they might be, or the nodes. And so you\u2019ve got a much simpler facilities model. In order to make fiat banking work you have to have a police force, because the next layer is physical or civil security and that\u2019s provided by a police force. If you have a billion dollars in New York City or a bank with a billion dollars, then you need a police force in New York City to keep you from getting mugged. But if you have a billion dollars in Bitcoin and you\u2019re in New York City, you don\u2019t rely upon the police force, nor does anybody know you have it. But if they did have it, the security for New York City comes from a Bitcoin miner in Iceland. And so security is not co-located with the asset in the Bitcoin system. In fact, security doesn\u2019t scale or it doesn\u2019t increase with the number of nodes of asset or the velocity of the asset in the Bitcoin system. In the fiat system security becomes a big problem, because maybe you have a billion dollars and you feel safe in New York, but when you go to Brazil, you don\u2019t. Or you go to _______, whichever place it is that you don\u2019t feel secure in, at some point you\u2019re required to rely upon the police protection as you cross jurisdictions. And that makes security heterogeneous and manual and expensive. And with Bitcoin you have the same security on a cruise ship in the mid-Atlantic as you have in a vault in the basement of J.P. Morgan in Manhattan as you have on an airplane. And even if you\u2019re sitting on a sailing boat in the Caribbean and three people have guns to your head, you\u2019ve still got the Bitcoin miner in Iceland securing your asset and it\u2019s a negotiation. The Bitcoin is quite secure! It\u2019s more secure than you are. You have a physical security issue, but your financial security is the highest degree that anybody in the human race has ever had before"}

Where especially if you\u2019ve properly custodied it, even if you\u2019ve got the three guns to your head in the middle of the Atlantic, if it\u2019s in a multisig done properly you\u2019re not going to lose custody of that asset. And even if they take you out in theory you have an inheritance or a succession model behind that such that the asset rolls on to your heirs or wherever you determine \u2014 you can\u2019t really do that with anything else, at least in a bearer asset form. You always end up trusting some intermediary to carry out your will, so that\u2019s something that makes Bitcoin very unique."}

It really is the only thing that you can take with you to the grave. And I joked about it. I was online going back and forth with Peter Schiff the other day. He was saying, \u201cWhy would anybody ever want something for 100 years, you\u2019ll all be dead by then?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell you can take it with you to the grave,\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell you can take gold to the grave.\u201d And I posted an article on ancient Egyptian burial tombs, and if you go back and you do even just a few seconds of history and do a few minutes of research, you know that for the last 5,000 years people have been trying to figure out how to bury gold with them \u2014 they\u2019ve all failed. 2,500 years ago the Egyptians created pyramids and hidden tombs. They still had the tomb robbers \u2014 people would break into the pyramids. The only reason that King Tut had a treasure that lasted into the 20th century was because it was buried by a sandstorm and people didn\u2019t know his tomb existed. It was lost. But every other protected tomb with a treasure in it was raided and looted. And if you pause and think about it a bit, and if you\u2019re really serious and thoughtful, what you realize is: there is no form of property that you can have custody of while you\u2019re alive and after you\u2019re dead, and there\u2019s no form of property that respects your wishes after you\u2019re dead, other than Bitcoin. And the significance of that is not you need the money after you\u2019re dead \u2014 that\u2019s not the point. The point is much deeper than that. The point is: should you wish for something to carry on, if you want a park watered for 100 years after your death, you have a method to ensure that takes place. And if I hold a gun to your head and I say, Give me all your property or I will shoot you, with all other forms of property, if you say No I shoot you can I get it anyway. So the game theory says I should just go ahead and kill you and take your property. But with Bitcoin the game theory says if I shoot you I get none of it, because you go to the grave with your keys. So with Bitcoin the game theory says I should ask for half, right? And it turns out that throughout human history, people have always struggled against governments and onerous groups be-it a monopoly or the like, but in nearly all of those cases, if they got half, they would\u2019ve turned out okay! Like, normally if they kept half \u2014 you don\u2019t like taxes, but if you kept half of your stuff, you would still be okay. The problem with taxes is they take all of it over the course of some period of time and you\u2019ve got none. You\u2019ve got no recourse, so you can\u2019t even negotiate. And it turns out that Bitcoin is the first thing where you can negotiate it. And because you can negotiate it, it\u2019s property that encourages peaceful resolution. And all other forms of property encourage violent resolution, because the phrase is, \u201cWinner takes all,\u201d right? All the other properties are winner takes all. I can either negotiate with you and take half \u2014 if the bullet costs a dollar and if the gun costs $387 and if you have a million dollars, I can either spend the dollar and take it all, or I can negotiate peacefully with you and I can take half of it. But, you know, the ROI on that last $1 bullet is $500,000. It\u2019s 500,000:1, and so the problem really is: other forms of physical property incentivize violence, and the game theory dictates a violent resolution. And it\u2019s even worse than that, because the person that lines up ten rich people against the wall and shoots all ten of them ends up getting all their money and they\u2019re able to raise an army and they\u2019re Mussolini or Hitler, and then they get to go line up the next 100, and then you get to line up the next \u2014 and then pretty soon you\u2019re Stalin, right? There\u2019s a benefit to the most violent, and they get powerful. But with Bitcoin, it works the opposite way, because first of all you can\u2019t get all of it with violence. You get none of it with violence. And the second thing is: as soon as I said, Robert, I\u2019m going to seize all your Bitcoin, your answer is, No, then when I say, I\u2019m sending guys to your house with guns to seize all your Bitcoin, the most likely result is you\u2019re going to wire your Bitcoin somewhere else in the universe that I don\u2019t know about, or you\u2019re going to put a multisignature on it and you\u2019re going to say, Look, you can put your guns at me, you can shoot me, you can pull out my fingernails, but I can\u2019t give it to you. It\u2019s like, Okay, well tell us who else has got the signature? Oh, somebody on a satellite has the signature. How about: a computer program on a satellite has it and they\u2019ve locked it up and I can\u2019t get it out until you release me and I\u2019ve lived happily for 5 years and then I can get it out. How do you negotiate with a computer program on a satellite? But if you don\u2019t want that you\u2019re just like, Okay well I just send it to somebody else. And now when that happens, the first person that attacks the Bitcoiner, he realizes, That didn\u2019t work out so well. And all the Bitcoin leaves your jurisdiction. And so the attack causes a response. What I\u2019m trying to say is: if you have 100 people with a billion dollars of gold each in your country you can shoot all 100 and take 100 billion dollars and the game theory says you should. If you have 100 people with a billion dollars of Bitcoin in your country, you could hold a gun, you could incarcerate them all and get half, but you won\u2019t, because as soon as you incarcerate one or two of the people, the other 98 will leave the country \u2014 the Bitcoin. You will end up with a country where you managed to get half of two people\u2019s Bitcoin, and 98% of the Bitcoin will exist your jurisdiction. So the real game theory says: Bitcoin has an immune system and 98%-99% departs from a hostile political jurisdiction when you start trying to seize the asset. And that\u2019s what makes it the apex property. And in the same way, that\u2019s what makes it anti-violence. And that\u2019s what makes it a cleansing technology for the human race, because Bitcoin promotes civility."}

So the physicality of the property itself is what makes it vulnerable to coercion, effectively. The ideal property would be something that\u2019s non-physical like Bitcoin. And this really gets to the crux of the value proposition of government and banking \u2014 frankly, it was the provision of the security for property. The bank was going to custody your gold, government was going to secure the territory so you could have peaceful commerce. And Bitcoin, by being the asset that has the security innate to it, it enables this radical new level of social scalability, so we\u2019re eliminating this duplication of efforts that every bank has their own, like you said, accountant, auditor, compliance, IT, HR \u2014 you\u2019ve now just eliminated the need for that. So it\u2019s such an economizing force as well. It\u2019s like, not only is it creating more civility, but it\u2019s creating more economic efficiency just by virtue of it being non-physical and having in-built security."}

So maybe that\u2019s one lens to view the significance of its value prop."}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim053-the-saylor-series-episode-13-bitcoin-is-cybernetic-life", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 13 | Bitcoin is Cybernetic Life", "text": "Michael Saylor 24:34\nYeah I think so. And we even got to the best part which is: Bitcoin has dematerialized the accountants, the auditors, the compliance function, the operations function, the HR function, the facilities function, the security function, of every single financial business \u2014 money mover or bank \u2014 it\u2019s also dematerialized the civil police and municipal security function everywhere where that function was there to protect property. All property policing. Now the next thing is what happens when two countries disagree? In order to protect your money you need a military, and if you don\u2019t have a military, fill in the blank, right? Ask the Spaniards during the Spanish Civil War or ask the French or the Polish people during World War II. If you don\u2019t have a military then you lose all your property rights. So the fiat system provides the geo-political security via military, via war, and via politics. And this is where I\u2019ll make this interesting point: Bitcoin\u2019s the first multi-national money. All the fiat currencies are national monies. Gold was a physical money. We\u2019ve replaced gold with fiat and with the banking system because we needed to move the money faster, at a higher velocity, and we needed to build new applications on it. So the price we paid was a central bank plus fractional banks. But even so, every single money is a national money, and if you want it to work in the world over time, you got the military, you got the state department in politics, and you got war, and that\u2019s the real expense of the fiat system. The fact that every 20, 30, 40 years you have to fight a war be-it World War I or World War II or ______ in order to defend your property. So how does Bitcoin avoid that? Well Bitcoin is a multi-national network and because it\u2019s challenging to locate the network \u2014 like you might be able to locate some of the miners but some miners you can\u2019t locate, they\u2019re off the grid. And half of the nodes are off the grid coming through the TOR network \u2014 you don\u2019t even know where they are. So the network is running orthogonal to geography or political jurisdiction. It\u2019s in cyberspace. And that means that geo-political disputes are settled in Bitcoin, but they\u2019re settled without war. So when one nation wants to tax a certain property, they can tax it. Maybe they can put a tax on a Bitcoin miner. But they will either put a tax that\u2019s so high that the miners shut down and then all the mining relocates or the network just reconfigures, or they will tax the Bitcoin miners at a level where the miners continue and the network just adjusts. So you\u2019ve got a peaceable resolution via the political process and there really is no incentive \u2014 if I actually raised an army of a million people and I have atomic bombs, I can\u2019t use that to get your Bitcoin, and no one else can use it to get mine, so again the trans-national violence is not really encouraged with Bitcoin. And what we\u2019ve done is we have taken a fiat system that was constructed to make gold money faster, smarter, stronger, and done with the best technology of the 20th century, we have taken that 20th century model and we\u2019ve replaced it with a 21st century model \u2014 Satoshi\u2019s model \u2014 that makes money faster, smarter, stronger again. But in the doing of it, it\u2019s hard to understate how much inefficiency we eliminate. Like if you replaced all the banks, all the money exchanges, and then half the police department and half the militaries, take half of that entire fiat system that\u2019s meant just to protect fiat money flows, take it away, and then what you realize is that Bitcoin is providing that monetary system that does something better a million times cheaper. To say it\u2019s a thousand times cheaper might be an understatement, but it\u2019s at least a thousand times cheaper. It\u2019s a massive crystallization or a collapsing to a lower energy state where you\u2019re able to provide a million times more security and you can move money at the speed of light and you can make it a million times smarter and you can do it a million times cheaper. All of those things at the same time. So that in and of itself is like inventing cold fusion. I could take a sugar cube and I could split the atom or I could take this bottle of water and I could run a fusion reactor on it that could power up the entire civilization for a year off the bottle of water \u2014 that\u2019s what it will do to the human condition. That kind of breakthrough technology."}

And that\u2019s really the pretext for war, is people fighting over scarce resources. And if there\u2019s one universal, I think it\u2019s: human beings could agree that war is a bad thing. It\u2019s the most uneconomic activity we can possibly engage in. You\u2019re mobilizing capital to go and destroy capital and clearly destroy a lot of human life as well. And I think a good way to look at it is that war\u2014in the 20th century, at least \u2014this was the violent mode of reaching consensus on property. To decide who owns what, countries would raise armies and go to war and draw the lines on the map and say this is mine, that\u2019s yours. And Bitcoin is this alternative mode, it\u2019s a peaceful mode for reaching consensus. It\u2019s like a peaceful alternative to war in a lot of ways."}

Why wouldn\u2019t I want to store all my life\u2019s work in something which is a spoil of peace? It\u2019s just better every way. So just a few more thoughts on the Bitcoin model and proof of work before we go deeper down the rabbit hole into the engineering dynamics. The proof of work model is: I do a bunch of work with energy, I generate a bunch of hashes, I try to solve the problem, I solve the problem, and then I claim the reward. I get paid for my work. The work that the Bitcoin miner is doing is somewhat uncertain \u2014 there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll actually win the block. But somebody is guaranteed to win, right? What you\u2019ve got is a bunch of people vying for the energy in the system. Every day, 900 Bitcoin get mined, a bunch of transaction fees get paid. All the Bitcoin miners are competing via honest work to win their share of that energy. The other part to the Bitcoin system is the difficulty adjustment. As more miners enter and as the hashrate increases, the difficulty goes up. So you could think about difficulty as a protocol for competition and the proof of work algorithm is the protocol for work. So another way to say this is: the Bitcoin network rests on competitive work. Now that\u2019s unique to a financial system, right? We never did it before with the fiat system. You could argue we kind of did something similar with gold. I mean gold is: you do a lot of work, the work is mining the gold, and there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll find the gold, but if you do find the gold then you get to sell the gold and you get paid for it. So there\u2019s some benefit. And then as more people get into gold mining, it gets more competitive one way or the other. So gold is a little bit like this, but I think that the more interesting idea here is that work and difficulty and Bitcoin feel a lot like the work and the difficulty in capitalism. So Bitcoin is a microcosm of capitalism. If you look at every single industry, what is the industry? Well I work in this industry, I work really hard to win customers, and I get paid \u2014 there\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019ll get them \u2014 if I launch a restaurant my restaurant may fail but it may succeed. If more people set up a restaurant then it gets harder for me. Maybe the market will grow, maybe it won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s uncertainty, there\u2019s competition. What\u2019s pretty clear is that I\u2019m incompetent if I don\u2019t get up and go to work every day. I can\u2019t guarantee you you\u2019ll mine the next block, but I can guarantee you if you turn off the Bitcoin mine, you won\u2019t mine the next block. I can\u2019t guarantee you that your movie will be a hit, but I can guarantee you that if you don\u2019t make the movie or you don\u2019t finish the movie it won\u2019t be a hit. So in capitalism you\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of industries and markets. You\u2019ve got groups of competitors, everybody is working. Some people come up with better technique. There\u2019s S19 miners \u2014 they\u2019re better than S9 miners. Invent a new Bitcoin miner, right? You can invent a new technique, you can run it harder, you can find a cheaper raw material. The same thing in Bitcoin mining goes on with every other industry. So capitalism is a proof of work with a difficulty adjustment. The difficulty adjustment is taking place \u2014 try launching your own mobile phone company in the year 2021 against Apple Computer. The difficulty has gotten pretty high!"}

If you\u2019re generating 30% profit margin, other entrepreneurs come in to try to feast on that profit margin. That is the difficulty adjustment in capitalism. The industry then becomes more competitive, it becomes more difficult to succeed. And then the opposite is also true: if you start generating losses, you actually expel competition. People go out of business. So it\u2019s so interesting to look at it that way, and I\u2019ve called Bitcoin in the past kind of a fractal of the free market. Like it\u2019s its own little free market that imposes free market principles at large."}

You could say that Satoshi was creating a competitive, honest work system to allocate the responsibility for the network and the rewards of the network. But you could also say it\u2019s modeled on a classic engineering control system. It\u2019s a first-order negative feedback loop. And if you look at the way that any aerospace airfoil \u2014 any airplane, any control system, any ballistic system, any targeting system works \u2014 you have these control systems and then you\u2019ve got several mechanisms and cybernetic mechanisms and it\u2019s like, I try this, I miss, I adjust, I try again, and you\u2019ve got a negative feedback in order to converge. The negative feedback of Bitcoin is the difficulty adjustment, and the control parameter is trying to converge on one block every 10 minutes to stay on schedule. It\u2019s not unlike an autopilot if you\u2019re trying to get from Point A to Point B over the course of a hundred units of time, and you\u2019ve gone 1 minute and you want to get there in 100 minutes. If you\u2019re behind, you check, and you go faster. And if you\u2019re ahead of schedule, you check, and you go slower. Because you want to end up doing 100% of the work in 100 minutes, so there\u2019s your negative feedback loop. You\u2019ll find this is built into thermostats, it\u2019s built into autopilots, it\u2019s built into all sorts of things in the engineering world. And it\u2019s built into every capitalist market. Now, I\u2019ll make one more point: Bitcoin\u2019s based on capitalism. Capitalism is based on nature. Where else do you see an example of work and difficulty? It\u2019s like: hunting. I\u2019m a predator, I get up in the day, I hunt. Is there any guarantee I will get anything? No. What happens if I don\u2019t hunt? There\u2019s a 100% guarantee I will starve. What happens if I do hunt? Maybe I will be the best hunter that will catch the gazelle. Maybe I will get unlucky and someone else less worthy than me will catch the gazelle. There is uncertainty. Maybe I will catch all the gazelle and there\u2019s no more gazelle and I will have to change my parameters. So in nature the prey, the predator are in this constant equilibrium \u2014 all the plants, all life forms \u2014 they\u2019re all working. What are they working to do? To capture energy from the ecosystem. The trees are trying to get the sunlight, right? The prey are trying to eat the leaves of the trees. And the predators are trying to eat the prey. And the difficulty is \u2014 if all the giraffe eat all the leaves of the trees then only the giraffe with the longest neck can reach the leaves that are left, and all the giraffes with a short neck starve to death. That\u2019s the difficulty adjustment. The difficulty adjustment is the slowest or the unluckiest creature gets eaten, and that\u2019s good. But the next week, all the wolves have to catch creatures that are faster than any creature they\u2019ve ever caught before. And vice versa. So you\u2019ve got continual feedback and evolution and survival of the fittest."}

So Bitcoin benefiting from this \u2014 whatever you want to call it, Bayesian Inference, the OODA loop \u2014 it\u2019s constantly adapting to its environment. That\u2019s why it out-competes all other forms of money."}

It\u2019s an adaptive control system for money. And maybe it\u2019s the first adaptive monetary system. And what is it adapting? What is the control function? The control function is \u2014 if we come back to our last set of discussions \u2014 what is the critical definition of ideal money? Shared, immutable, correct ledger. So what is Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin is an adaptive control system and it\u2019s targeting correct. It\u2019s self-correcting. It\u2019s a self-correcting monetary system. For example: how does gold go off the rails? Well I started with 21 million gold coins and then someone sacked the Inca empire and brought back 10 million more. Now I\u2019ve got 31 million gold coins. Well where\u2019s the self-correcting part? I don\u2019t want 31 million, I want 21 million. I just diluted the value of the civilization by 30%. It\u2019s not self-correcting. Someone made 2% gold \u2014 it\u2019s not self-correcting. Okay well if you have 2% error every year in a thermostat, well the thermostat you grew up with as a kid if going to fry you by the time you\u2019re 47. What happens if you add 2 degrees a year to a thermostat? Well it\u2019s going to be 182 degrees by the time you retire. Your books are going to burn at Farenheit 451 \u2014 just give it a few years! You can\u2019t tolerate 2% drift, much less 7% drift. All of these adaptive control systems \u2014 like the steam engine is based on negative feedback, thermostats, even longitude. John Harrison when he invented longitude \u2014 we talked about it \u2014 how do you find longitude in the ocean? You need two clocks. How do I actually get two clocks to keep time when you have heat that\u2019s compressing and expanding the material in the clock? The answer is: I have to sandwich in or wedge three different layers, and one layer has to contract as the other expands so they off-set so that you eliminate the bias. You can\u2019t afford to have any flex. You need perfect \u2014 like how do I get a watch to run true? I can\u2019t have it lose 2 seconds a day or 5 seconds a day. I need perfect timings. Otherwise you\u2019re going to miss by 100 meters, right? And so all of engineering is all about error-correction and adaptive control systems. So Bitcoin is a self-correcting monetary system, and fiat isn\u2019t, and gold isn\u2019t, and commodity money isn\u2019t. Because there\u2019s nobody that can play God. If God could reduce the number of gold coins to 21 million every time someone tried to slide another one in there, it would be self-correcting. When you lost something or you shaded it or counterfeited it or whatever, if you had some deity then maybe you\u2019d have a self-correcting system but we don\u2019t. We know the fiats are \u2014 there\u2019s no truth to them. No one even knows how many dollars there are, right? There are two things we don\u2019t know in this world: how many ounces of gold there are, and how many dollars there are. And there\u2019s one thing we do know: how much Bitcoin has been created and how much will be created. So I think that taken in its entirety, what Satoshi engineered was an adaptive control system for money. A self-correcting system. And ultimately a natural system, a natural, conservative, organic system. If I look at creatures in the wild and they have to compete in their ecology, in their ecosystem all the time, then they\u2019re healthy. And when I make them zoo creatures they stop competing and at the point that you become a zoo creature and you\u2019re fed and you\u2019re sitting in a chair watching Netflix, you become progressively less healthy, and you become more fragile. So all of these fiat currencies are zoo creature money. They\u2019re not natural. When we say, That\u2019s not natural, when you think about it you realize the things that are healthy are natural, because nature is conservative. And by conservative I don\u2019t mean politcally conservative, I mean physically, thermo-dynamically conservative. Nature never takes 22 creatures and turns it into 57 million creatures overnight. If you have 22 and 3 die you have 19. Nature is conservative \u2014 there are consequences. And if a wolf eats all the deer and there are no more deer, then the wolf starves to death and then the deer come back because there are consequences. Bitcoin is wonderfully engineered because A) the protocol is conservative and mathematically correct, B) the proof of work algorithm is an honest work, it is an open egalitarian work, anyone can do that work \u2014 I can do that work with brute force energy, I can do that work with new machinery, I can do that work anywhere in the world, no one can stop me from doing that work, ergo it\u2019s an open natural system, it\u2019s not a closed system. Your zoo creature is living in a closed, air-conditioned system, and the wild animals living in an open system, wild animals are going to evolve and adapt to an open environment which is much more challenging. Zoo creatures are going to adapt to a closed environment. What\u2019s an example of an adaption to a closed environment? You\u2019re 300 lbs overweight because you sit in a chair watching Netflix. There are no fat predators."}

This is then maybe the commonality between life and Bitcoin, is that each is really just a survival strategy at the end of the day. Your DNA is the collective lessons of your survival strategy across history, and it\u2019s kind of like an organic blockchain and Bitcoin is just this survival strategy for money. Life is that strategy propagating through flesh, Bitcoin is propagating through code, and both of them are error-correcting their own behavior. Life is intelligently figuring out what it needs to do to advance itself to extend its DNA into the future, and Bitcoin is adapting to human behavior to extend itself into the future. So its not just an analogy that we say that this thing is an organism, it feels pretty damn close to true."}

Is it going to be a barnyard animal, is it a domesticated pet? Is it a zoo creature? Or did we release it into the wild? And Bitcoin was cybernetic life released into the wild because proof of work is inherently permissionless, which means that it was meant to live in all environments and to go everywhere and you can\u2019t keep it caged. To the extent you try to keep it caged, then you lose control of it. There are other forms of cybernetic life that have been designed not to go in the wild, like a proof of stake system. A proof of stake is more like a barnyard animal or a zoo creature \u2014 you\u2019ve designed a domesticated pet which is kind of toothless and maybe it\u2019s got pretty feathers, but it was never meant to live in the jungle.

We talked about why currency was introduced to augment some of its shortcomings. But also suffers from its own problems and it ultimately fails as we have seen and are seeing. So how does Bitcoin fit into the picture?"}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim050-the-saylor-series-episode-12-why-bitcoin-succeeds", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 12 | Why Bitcoin Succeeds", "text": "Michael Saylor 1:56\nSo Bitcoin as money. Simply put, Bitcoin\u2019s the best money the human race has ever had the ability to embrace. We know gold is defective because of its mechanical nature, and we know fiat\u2019s defective because of its political nature. Why does Bitcoin work? Bitcoin has the things that you need in order to construct a shared, immutable, correct ledger. That\u2019s our target. Shared, immutable, correct ledger. And Bitcoin\u2019s got a base layer protocol. The base layer protocol was genetically embedded in the system from day one \u2014 the 21 million coins is one of the critical parts of it. The 2.1 quadrillion satoshis and no more than that. The second part of the protocol is not just the mathematical coin parameter, it\u2019s also the proof of work security model. So when we created it, [Satoshi] created it with the 21 million coin limit, he created it with the proof of work security model, and that is the part that makes it more likely to be immutable and shared and correct. And the third part is the balance of power between the miners, the nodes, and the wallets\u2014or the HODLers. It wasn\u2019t inevitable that you had to build it this way. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary system, so it\u2019s a feat of engineering. They built a protocol, they chose components \u2014 they chose cryptography, they chose proof of work \u2014 all of these are engineered components. And the balance of power between the miners, the nodes, and the HODLers with the wallets \u2014 that became clear in the block size wars I think. And following the block size wars \u2014 I mean first miners were the nodes and then the miners and the nodes split, and eventually we saw that the nodes themselves had a huge amount of power to check the power of the miners, but now we\u2019re seeing the emergence of the power of the HODLers, and of course \u2014 all three of these dimensions are decentralized. So I would say that we need the protocol, the base layer, that base layer protocol that I just described that replaces the gold that was here at the beginning of the universe, and it replaces the base layer protocol that\u2019s the political artifact of any kind of fiat currency. The second thing that Bitcoin has that makes it a much better money is it has an application layer protocol. The base layer protocol ensures that we\u2019ll never have more than 21 million Bitcoin. I mean that\u2019s the most important thing. And then it ensures \u2014 what do I need? I need durability, integrity, and security. So I need to know that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin even 1,000 years from now, I need to know that people aren\u2019t going to monkey with material things like the frequency or the block size \u2014 that\u2019s the integrity part of it \u2014 and I guess durability and integrity they go arm-in-arm in a way because if you change the frequency and the block size you may inadvertently end up changing the limit [of Bitcoin] at some point because you break it. And then you need security: you need to know that no malefactor can hack it or break into the network. So we\u2019re getting all of those things \u2014 the security, the integrity, the durability, via the base layer protocol. But the application layer protocol is also important, and that\u2019s the ability to do final settlement transactions at the base layer with a Bitcoin wallet address, and we could debate, interestingly Robert, like: do you need Lightning or not? And that\u2019s an interesting debate, because I think that if we just had the ability to do base layer transactions on the Bitcoin network, the system is still perfected enough to serve as a monetary system. You would end up with the layer 2 application being built via counterparties with some counterparty risk instead of what you can do with Lightning. But the combination of base layer transactions via Bitcoin wallet and then layer 2 transactions via Lightning wallet, I think those two things together are clearly superior as an application-level protocol. And if you group them together and say that is the non-custodial decentralized open source protocol for moving money around in the Bitcoin standard, then you\u2019ve got the structure of something really compelling. Another way to describe this is: Bitcoin gives you a base layer protocol to move large sums of money around at small cost in an hour, and it gives you a layer 2 protocol to move mid-level and small sums of money around instantly for almost nothing. On my Lightning wallet I can move 1,000 satoshis at the cost of 1 satoshi in a second. Which is more efficient. I can move 100,000 satoshis, which is like $30 \u2014 I can move $30 for 1 satoshi in a second. That makes that layer 2 protocol faster and more efficient than any other currency transfer protocol that I\u2019m aware of in the history of the world."}

And my understanding of it is: as the network proliferates and the network density grows, that the transactions per second actually increase. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an upper bound on that, so the Lightning Network could actually be at full scale this global system of instant final settlement, effectively, which is mind-blowing."}

As long as someone can take final settlement of $100,000 in an hour for $5 or 50 cents \u2014 I think right now if you set a lower fee and you were willing to wait longer you can take final settlement in a day for a nickel or some very small amount.

And so I think that\u2019s critical. I think Lightning is probably something that\u2019s going to accelerate the spread of Bitcoin, and it\u2019s the logical next step. If we can engineer a decentralized non-custodial crypto-asset network based on private keys and cryptography and the like as Bitcoin, then there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t engineer a layer 2 of Bitcoin that\u2019s also non-custodial and decentralized that makes a different set of trade-offs. In essence, I think the Lightning Network is a decentralized, open, proof of stake network. But the critical issue is: it\u2019s a proof of stake network not staked with its own token \u2014 it\u2019s staked with the underlying token of Bitcoin, which makes it a much higher integrity, much longer-living, more secure open decentralized network, than one that was created with its own token, which would be self-referential."}

Which makes sense. So we\u2019ve got two things: we\u2019ve got a base layer protocol, and we\u2019ve got an application layer protocol. And so why does the Bitcoin standard work? Or why is Bitcoin the best monetary system? How does it succeed in reality? Well, let\u2019s start with inflation. The scourge of inflation which destroys fiat and destroys gold doesn\u2019t exist. In Bitcoin you\u2019ve got a conservative system and a mathematically complete system. So it\u2019s mathematically correct and it is conservative in a thermodynamic sense that we don\u2019t add additional energy in the system nor does it deplete energy in the system. And the basis of that conservation is that base layer protocol. The base layer protocol plus the proof of work together. You couldn\u2019t design the system which wasn\u2019t conservative. Just because you get everything else right \u2014 if Satoshi had gotten everything else right but had left some randomness or some inflation in the token count, it wouldn\u2019t have been ideal. The second thing that is a big attribute for it is the difficulty of confiscation. So the private keys of cryptography are the strongest property rights in the history of the human race. So if we think about cryptography as the basis of property rights, then truthfully the only property you can really own is digital property on a secure crypto-asset network, of which the only one we know of is Bitcoin. So right now, the only property you can truly own is Bitcoin. Look, if we ever went to Alpha Centauri and we went to a new planet and we cut off communication with the Earth, it\u2019s possible that the dictator of Alpha Centauri could spin up another Bitcoin network \u2014 Centauri network. And if it was a closed system and it had the same exact mathematics as this, as it spread as a virus and infected the billions of people in Alpha Centauri it would be its own crypto-asset network. So you can imagine something like that, but right now what you\u2019ve got is one successful life form and that is Bitcoin. And so you\u2019ve got one successful digital property and now we actually have an engineered property and so you have a scientific basis for property rights. We\u2019ve never had it before. It\u2019s illustrated pretty effectively. It\u2019s like, if you have a million dollars and you convert the million into a building, well the building can be seized by the mayor by eminent domain. You can lose your building and you can\u2019t move the building. So the building is impaired property and the building can be taxed. It is immobile, it can be seized, it could be taxed, and it also has physical nexus which means a meteorite can fall on it or an earthquake can wipe it out, so there are risks to the building. The useful life of the building is 100 years, maybe less if it\u2019s poorly constructed. And it\u2019s only appealing to people in that geographic-political nexus. If the building was in North Korea, how valuable is a building in North Korea to an investment company in New York City? So a building as property leaves a lot to be desired. Land as property has the same issue. A block in Manhattan is a lot more valuable than a block in the middle of the desert, because the land is geographically located next to a lot of investors with a lot of money that can actually develop the land for some economic purpose. And the land can be impaired and taxed. Property tax \u2014 there\u2019s a phrase: in the real estate business they always talk about triple net, and triple net is like, After your taxes, after your expenses, etc. So these are high-maintenance properties. They\u2019re very expensive and not very portable. So you can rifle through the properties. Well there\u2019s art, there\u2019s gold, there\u2019s silver, there\u2019s commodities, there\u2019s securities, there are bonds, there are currency baskets. They all have some liability, many of them are currency derivatives and so as currency derivatives they have dilution coming from the inflation of the underlying currency. But the ones that have physicality are subject to search and seizure and impairment because you can\u2019t move them. Others are unique, maybe, but even though you might own art people are going to keep making more art. And so if you\u2019re looking for a property that no one can seize, that is hardest to impair, Bitcoin is the hardest to impair property. Technically I would say it\u2019s probably the hardest to tax, the hardest to destroy, the hardest to seize, and the hardest to impair, of any property available to you to purchase at this point."}

If I shoot you in the head you can\u2019t take your gold with you. The Egyptian pharaohs built the Pyramids to take the gold with them\u2014they were all robbed. If I said to you, Take the million dollars and buy some property and then you\u2019re going to be murdered by somebody in your family next week \u2014 buy some property that they won\u2019t get after you\u2019re dead \u2014 what is that property?"}

Gold \u2014 all these things are seizable. You can\u2019t take them with you. But if you hold Bitcoin and you hold the private keys in your head, when you die, the Bitcoin goes with you and no one else gets their hands on it. And the significance of that is: because it\u2019s impossible to confiscate with force and because it disappears with your death, then any hostile actor always has an incentive to negotiate with you because it\u2019s better for me to hold a gun to your head and take half of it than pull the trigger and get none of it. And that\u2019s not true with any other property. In all other cases I can pull the trigger and get all of it. And so you have an unstable situation with that property. And the interesting thing is: that confiscation element, it works at the individual level, the institutional level, and the nation-state level. So if one nation is going to declare war on another nation and murder everybody, they get their gold. They also get their land. They also get their factories. I mean there\u2019s a joke, neutron bomb \u2014 I\u2019ll just nuke you and we\u2019ll leave the cities. I might get the gold, the silver, the farmland, the buildings, the factories, the ships \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t get the Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin is not spoils of war. Other things may be, but Bitcoin is not spoils of war. With regard to a bank or a financier, if you own the Bitcoin and someone puts a claim against you, the way it normally works is: I\u2019ve got a million dollars with the bank and I borrow against it and then they decide to mark my securities down and they force-liquidate me and they sell all of my securities and take my property. That happened with Archegos. I mean it happens all the time. It happens all the time with crypto exchanges. If you have the crypto on the exchange, or your Bitcoin, and you borrow against it and you can\u2019t meet a margin call, they can force-liquidate your assets and they seize them. But if you pull your assets off the exchange and if you hold your private keys, then your bank can\u2019t seize your assets in a hostile fashion \u2014 they would be more likely to negotiate with you. And because you can take custody of it, you don\u2019t necessarily need to rely upon this all-or-nothing: either I give you all my stocks and I borrow against them or I have none of them. We could split the difference with: I give you proof that I have it \u2014 proof of reserves \u2014 without transfer of the asset, in return for a different type of loan."}

Under the duress of war, the desperation of warfare, we figure out new ways of doing things \u2014 do you think armed conflict in the 21st century could accelerate nation-state adoption of Bitcoin as this advantage dawns on them that they can be plundered of their gold but not necessarily their Bitcoin?"}

For example, when people are fighting wars, like when we were fighting wars we were hauling over C130s or air freighters full of pallets of cash, right? So normally the way you fight wars is with gold or with cash or with something. And if you\u2019re cut off and you need to buy or sell materials of some sort, you need hard currency. So I think that yeah it will accelerate the adoption of technology like Bitcoin. And coming back to this issue: because it\u2019s not confiscatable, it doesn\u2019t invite violence on your person from other family members. Like for example, do you ever worry about being murdered by a family member because of whatever your will says? If you had your Bitcoin in a multisignature relationship or a multisig something-or-other, then maybe it changes that dynamic. So I think all sorts of violence against the individual, against the company, against the institution, or against the municipality or the nation-state \u2014 I think those are all less likely. Less likely to happen and more likely to result in negotiation. So why else is Bitcoin going to succeed? Why does it succeed? Well because hypothecation is so much more difficult. I\u2019m not saying impossible, but the layer 1 and the layer 2 protocols \u2014 Bitcoin and Lightning \u2014 those mitigate the need for hypothecation. It\u2019s less likely you would need to trust all your assets. If I can move 1% of my assets a day for a satoshi, then I wouldn\u2019t put all my assets in a bank. Right now all of your assets, all your stocks, are probably in a bank. You don\u2019t hold any of them. In theory you could actually take possession of your stocks as certificates and put them in a safe deposit box \u2014 take them out of street name, they say."}

So the protocols mitigate hypothecation, and also they punish hypothecators. If someone did go naked short Bitcoin in order to make a quick dollar and you pulled all your Bitcoin off the exchange and they have to then settle, it creates a massive short squeeze. So whenever you pull those securities away from the hypothecator then they get squeezed. So if I knew that it was impossible, like if you had a billion in gold and I knew you\u2019re never going to take delivery of it, I can short it 100:1. And if I knew you\u2019d never take delivery of the Bitcoin I might get a little bit cute, but in a world where people can \u2014 there are exchanges that fail just like there are bad banks that fail, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re failing continually in Bitcoin because that\u2019s the nature of the free market and that\u2019s how the free market squeezes out defective actors and malicious actors. And the ones that have perfected security and the like, they succeed. So the fourth dimension of virtue for Bitcoin is superior authentication. And again the layer 1, the layer 2 protocols and cryptography in general what you can do \u2014 proof of keys and the like, proof of reserves \u2014 they solve the authentication issue. And maybe it solved for the first time, effectively, when you want to settle and you want to buy a piece of real estate sometimes it takes a week or two weeks to do a title search and it\u2019s a manual process so you\u2019re talking about a hyper-expensive manual process to even do a title search on a small amount of property. And Bitcoin gives you a way \u2014 I mean presumably it\u2019s somewhere between 1,000%-1,000,000% cheaper and faster. Like it\u2019s not an order of magnitude, it\u2019s many orders of magnitude better on the authentication. And maybe even more important than that, you can automate the authentication. So that means that a computer program could authenticate 100,000,000 different HODLers every hour for a nickel. And when you get to that level that opens up the possibility to create new types of businesses and new types of applications that otherwise would have been cost-prohibitive because of the friction involved. Bitcoin succeeds over fiat based upon transportation dynamics too \u2014 the fifth element of virtue. It\u2019s fast on layer 1, and it\u2019s instant on layer 2. Moving $100,000,000 of property on layer 1 in an hour is fast, but moving $100,000 on layer 2 in a second for nearly free is instant. And so it\u2019s just much faster. And it comes with no artificial geo-political constraints. Even when you have fast on fiat, you have fast but with the geo-political constraints that are continually shifting. Whereas fast on Bitcoin has no geo-political jurisdiction, it\u2019s cyberspace. It\u2019s orthogonal to geo-political space. And what you want is a situation where a billion people in China could all authenticate themselves and trade on a value network through the great Chinese firewall to a website sitting in Cuba or sitting in the US. You\u2019ll never do that with any kind of fiat system. In fact, the entire Chinese system is constructed to create a capital firewall so that capital can\u2019t flow out of China or in China. The central bank chokes it in order to maintain the RMB peg versus the Dollar. So that idea that I can cross that layer instantly, that means that I can build a value exchange into a billion transactions a minute, and I can build a value exchange that flows in a billion transactions a minute for a billion people across 100,000,000 different applications. And they can all move fluidly, right? So I guess it\u2019s the difference between, if you want a metaphor \u2014 liquid fluid flow into a container \u2014 that\u2019s Bitcoin and Lightning. Or, you take 1 kg gold blocks or even 400 oz London good delivery bars, you can build whatever you want with those. But one of them is like LEGO that are 400 oz each, and the other is water \u2014 liquid, or air. There\u2019s just no comparison between the two."}

We\u2019re back to this \u2014 there\u2019s some core point where again earlier the customer optionality to withdraw their Bitcoin out of the bank at any time keeps the service provider honest, so then the service providers actually have to compete for the business which gives us lower prices, better services, better innovation, more wealth, move freedom. And it\u2019s all rooted in this precision of customer choice. Similar with the LEGO, you don\u2019t have as much option with the big block, but if you\u2019re at the molecular level of the fluid you have a lot of optionality."}

And are you dancing using 2-ton granite blocks? Or are you dancing using water? With air? And what structures can you create? If we take all those things together and you consider the consequences for distribution, Bitcoin is something that can be distributed to everybody on Earth for effectively free, so it\u2019s truly liquid. What I need is if I wanted to distribute something to 8 billion people and I wanted 8 billion transactions an hour forever \u2014 like I want that degree of fluidity \u2014 I need to do it at the price of a satoshi a transaction. I need to do it with very low friction. So this low-transport cost, this low friction, results in massive distribution. And we can see with gold, for example, there isn\u2019t 1 oz of gold for everybody in the world to give to them, and so there\u2019s no way to distribute money with gold. And if we take fiat we know there\u2019s 1.7 billion people that are unbanked \u2014 maybe more \u2014 and we know the ones that are banked are imperfectly banked and the banks don\u2019t cross-connect, so we can\u2019t find a good way to distribute money via fiat or via gold, but via Bitcoin we do have a clear way. The last element is this division, the ability to break it down. I can\u2019t break down a gold bar or gold coin. I can sort of break down fiat, but even 1 penny is like too much sometimes. Being able to go down to 1 satoshi is better than 1 penny, expecially because of this one thing: one of the big problems in cybersecurity is spamming and scamming. So I can\u2019t use the DMs of my Instagram because 99% of the communication is spam or scam. I can\u2019t really use the DMs of non-verified or non-followed individuals on Twitter because of the same thing. I can\u2019t really use e-mail without very expensive e-mail filters that are continually filtering out spam and scam and the like, so there\u2019s massive amounts of cyber in-security. Every single day \u2014 if you have a website \u2014 it gets attacked by a denial-of-service attacks all the time. The reason for DDoS attacks and scams and spam is there\u2019s no cost to attack it. There\u2019s no skin in the game. And so what we need is to introduce skin in the game. The way to do it is to require a value exchange whenever you move through a router. If you had to pay a price to send a message, at some point you would attenuate large amounts of that scamming, spamming activity. I mean that\u2019s why proof of work was created in the first place: Adam Back was trying to come up with a solution to stop spam. But the other thing you can do is you can actually tie the value, say 100,000 satoshis, as a security deposit into your persona online. If you posted 100,000 satoshis to your Twitter account and if they gave you an orange check and that was your security deposit, then the understanding would be, if you misbehave you get fined, and if you\u2019re a malicious actor maybe you forfeit the security deposit. This is the way it works when you\u2019re renting a home. This is the way it works in all the real-world \u2014 you\u2019re a bonded laborer? You can\u2019t drive a car without proof of insurance, right? So we have these kind of insurance policies or security deposits or performance bonds that pop up all through the real-world economy. And in the absence of all of those, because you\u2019re a real-world actor, you have a risk. And the risk is: if you misbehave, you have culpability, you\u2019re responsible. You may get pulled over by a cop. If you say something rude to somebody\u2019s wife you may get punched in the face. You have either economic skin in the game or you have actual skin in the game. If you walk out onto a bridge that rickety and you screw around and you do back flips you fall off the bridge, you may die. There are consequences in the real world and the economic world but there are no consequences in cyberspace for many of these activities. And so the result is: people actually even create programs to create bots, and I might spit out 100 million fake Michael Saylors to do irrational malicious things, and they\u2019re not even me \u2014 they can\u2019t die. By the way when you do that that\u2019s a denial-of-service attack. The result of that is cyber in-security. So the fluidity, the speed, and the efficiency of the Bitcoin and Lightning Network has the potential to give us a solution to the cybersecurity problem if we simply start to tie a small Lightning wallet or an amount into some of these systems that YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, Medium, Reddit \u2014 all these other places where people \u2014 there\u2019s not a day that goes by that someone doesn\u2019t post a Michael Saylor video on YouTube offering to get you free Bitcoin. I\u2019m like, That\u2019s not me! But there\u2019s no verification on YouTube or registration so if you had to actually post some deposit and if you forfeited the deposit \u2014 by the way, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t take down the accounts \u2014 they do. They take them down within a day of when I report them. Every day there\u2019s ten Michael Saylor accounts that get taken down on Twitter. It\u2019s just there\u2019s no economic cost. And I understated that, really. The truth is that on my news feed there\u2019s a thousand Michael Saylors that have stolen my image and my name. If you charged them all a quarter each it would become a massive revenue source for Twitter, the scammers would immediately realize that there\u2019s a cost to attack the system. The amount of malicious behavior would drop by 99%."}

The only way you can post something of monetary value in the fiat standard is with a credit card and then you dox yourself and then you\u2019re not anonymous anymore. And that\u2019s offensive to one group of people that don\u2019t want to be identified \u2014 they want privacy. But it\u2019s also prohibitive to another group of people that don\u2019t have a credit card. And the third group of people that have a credit card but the credit card won\u2019t clear across nation-state boundaries. Bitcoin solves that problem. And it fixes it. So on one hand, one extreme benefit is, Yeah, Bitcoin\u2019s a way to store a billion dollars for 100 years. On the other extreme, Bitcoin\u2019s a way for everybody on Twitter to post 30 cents in order to eliminate 99% of the malicious behavior and improve the quality of the experience. Now back to your dance: if Twitter can ask for 100,000 satoshi deposit and if people give it and if Twitter\u2019s quality of service goes up by an order of magnitude and their cybersecurity enhances, that might put pressure on Instagram. That might put pressure on Google. And ultimately now what you have is every big tech company competing with every other big tech company to improve their service by building Bitcoin into their service, because Bitcoin can eliminate fraud on YouTube. And Bitcoin can eliminate fraud and cyber in-security on Instagram. And so you\u2019ve got something \u2014 it\u2019s like, Why do I adopt this new technology? Because I can, or because I need to? The early adopter does it because they can, and the later adopters do it because they need to. If PayPal doesn\u2019t roll out Bitcoin and Square does, then Square starts to eat PayPal\u2019s lunch. And if PayPal and Square both roll out Bitcoin and Apple and Google don\u2019t, then they\u2019re at a loss, right? So you have competition that\u2019s embracing new technology to progress the civilization to a better space. Bitcoin\u2019s the future for cyberspace. It\u2019s the promise of cybersecurity. In fact, that\u2019s the great irony: people criticize Bitcoin as maybe being a tool of cyber-hackers, but the ultimate destiny of Bitcoin is to make cyberspace safe for 8 billion people by building it into every cyber-offering and creating skin in the game for every malefactor, and consequences that are not based upon counterparty risk and don\u2019t have to be threaded through nation-states or central banks or credit card companies."}

Just simply by introducing that risk of loss for agents in the system, you\u2019re just incentivizing honesty which is again this grand theme of Bitcoin.

I think that experimentation is very important especially as we see more people being deplatformed, cancelled, censored, etc. So it just seems like there\u2019s this potential for Bitcoin to restore honest, unstoppable discourse in the digital age."}

Decentralized, open, non-custodial, and they all have promise based upon the core idea. So if we wrap up this entire Bitcoin standard discussion: why does Bitcoin succeed in theory? Well because the base layer protocol is mathematically sound and secure, and the application-layer protocol is sound and it\u2019s open to upgrade. And therefore the property rights that it delivers are perfected, and they\u2019re open to upgrade. The open network means that you can upgrade\u2014and when I say upgrade, maybe upgrade means keep making the Lightning Network better, maybe upgrade means roll out Square cash app with Square cash tags, maybe the upgrade means building it into Apple Pay \u2014 what does it mean? It means 100,000 different things. There\u2019s a free market a Darwinian competition to build applications and other types of platforms that are upgrading the Bitcoin protocol, and they\u2019re drawing on the promise of digital property in order to meet some other use case. And there will be some that will succeed, there\u2019s going to be some exchanges that fail, some succeed. There\u2019s 100,000 different ways to think about a wallet, right? Some are better than others. The market will sort it out. We\u2019ve got a very competitive Darwinian system, but the result is: every intelligent person that encounters Bitcoin, they\u2019re incentivized to find a way to make Bitcoin more valuable. And they might do it by a creative financial application, they might do it with security, they might do it with a device, they might do it with a software program, they might do it by plugging into a different network a different way, and some ideas will be great ideas and other ideas will be good ideas, and some ideas will be bad ideas. And Bitcoin will benefit from the good ideas, it will accelerate from the great ideas, and it will ignore and slough off the bad ideas. And that\u2019s something that gold and fiat, they don\u2019t have working for them, right? You could imagine some gold applications but you\u2019re crippled \u2014 gold jewelry, gold goblets, gold coins. And then that\u2019s the end of the road with gold. With fiat applications we took that much further \u2014 heck we created sovereign debt, we created all sorts of interesting money markets and all sorts of other securities with fiat, we created traveler\u2019s checks, we created credit cards. You can\u2019t say there aren\u2019t interesting applications \u2014 the entire Visa and Mastercard network is kind of a thing of awesome beauty if you compare it to the system of Roman gold coinage, clearly. It got the civilization to where it is. Bitcoin is really just still early days. We\u2019re just into the second decade, and these applications and these networks that will be built on it are in some ways a blink of an eye. But you see in the conventional world companies like NYDIG and NYDIG has built a CeFi platform and that platform is being used to deploy Bitcoin-type services to banks downstream. They\u2019ve created a platform so that you could create a credit card that integrates with Bitcoin in some way. So that\u2019s layer 2, layer 3. It\u2019s a custodial layer 2, not a non-custodial layer 2. You have counterparty risk in NYDIG, but there\u2019s nothing that says that it couldn\u2019t become a non-custodial Lightning-based platform at some point. Who knows? But that\u2019s one approach, and then Lightning is another approach to a layer 2, a non-custodial decentralized layer 2. But there\u2019s no monopoly on this, you could create a competitor to it if you wanted to, and then you can create applications like Square Cash App which is another custodial application, but it is an open custodial application so to the extent that you want to you can move your Bitcoin out and move it to another layer 2 platform or to another application or just take self-custody. So there\u2019s all these different ways that the network is evolving."}

It\u2019s relatively cheap to secure. So even if you are taking some counterparty risk with some of these layer 2, layer 3 technologies, a lot of them can be set up to either you withdraw manually or even you automate the withdrawal into self-custody."}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim050-the-saylor-series-episode-12-why-bitcoin-succeeds", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 12 | Why Bitcoin Succeeds", "text": "Michael Saylor 53:48\nYeah sometimes the hardcore Bitcoiners are a little bit hard on everybody and it\u2019s like the perfect being the enemy of the good. For example, if I buy the Bitcoin and I trust a counterparty for a week but I have the option to take it off the exchange or out of the mobile app when I want, that\u2019s a totally different situation than if I bought a million dollars worth of land in California. You will never in a million years be able to move the million dollars of land in California out of California. So the custodial risk of a building or land is orders of magnitude greater. You\u2019re trusting the mayor of the city and the governor and the nation-state and every bureaucrat, and you\u2019re never going to change that. Whereas \u2014 look, even if you bought Bitcoin on PayPal when they didn\u2019t have the wire out option, people had a big fit on Twitter. But the truth is, so you had some Bitcoin on PayPal and for 6 months you couldn\u2019t take custody of it and then after 6 months and the big protest about it eventually they upgraded their wallet and now you can. So it is possible if you buy Bitcoin in certain places that you\u2019ll be able to custody it or move it somewhere in the next year or two or three years, but it\u2019s absolutely impossible that you will ever convert a building in New York City into something which moves at the speed of light on the Lightning Network. Not without selling it, liquidating it, paying the capital gain tax on it and converting it. So I think that generally just about all these flavors of Bitcoin are higher-quality property. And sometimes people want to own the Bitcoin outright and I get that because our company owns the Bitcoin outright because we want to be able to transfer and take custody and do whatever we want with it \u2014 we want sovereignty over it. But if you were to own Bitcoin in a fund or in an ETF, it\u2019s still the second-highest quality property you could own. It\u2019s not the best property in the universe because the best property in the universe is own the Bitcoin. But the second-best property in the universe is own a Bitcoin derivative that 1-for-1 backed by Bitcoin from a counterparty that you can reasonably trust. And there are plenty of examples where people have buckets of money and they can buy the security but they can\u2019t buy the Bitcoin. It\u2019s like in some retirement plan and they can buy the security but they can\u2019t buy the Bitcoin. And there are lots of investors \u2014 trillions of trillions of dollars of money managers \u2014 and they\u2019ve raised money, I have 10 billion dollars in my portfolio and because of tax code or because of law or because of contracts that I have with my limited partners or my charter, I can\u2019t buy that Bitcoin buy I can buy a security based on Bitcoin. And so the real world is a nuanced one where there are lots of different types of capital. Not all capital is fungible. If I have a billion dollars it doesn\u2019t mean I can just convert a billion into Bitcoin overnight. I might have 100 million and all I can do is buy land. And I might have another 100 million and all I can do is buy a security. And I might have another 100 million and all I can buy is debt. If that was the case, I would prefer to have debt backed by Bitcoin, land underneath a Bitcoin miner, and a security that is a Bitcoin-backed security, because those three things would be sitting on a stronger foundation of collateral, than to buy three things that have no relationship to Bitcoin. And so that\u2019s the value of Bitcoin. Ultimately you compare gold standard to fiat standard to Bitcoin standard and your conclusion is: Bitcoin is simply digital money and digital money is an engineered system to create a shared, immutable, correct ledger. If you were Satoshi and you were doing it again, your checklist would be: Okay how do I make it shared and open? How do I keep it from changing? How do I make it mathematically correct? And then what kind of things can I put in it that will cause the entire world to want to protect it and secure it and improve it over time? Instead of attack it and destroy it? And I think that\u2019s what Satoshi created, is this engineered digital asset network that happens to make the best monetary system that the human race has come up with. If there\u2019s ever a better one, you\u2019ll start from those principles of digital money and you\u2019ll say, How do I make it better? And you could imagine maybe something better, but what\u2019s most likely to happen is the Bitcoin blockchain just migrates into the better thing and it goes on, right?"}

There\u2019s the speed of light, and that\u2019s a limit Einstein spent a lot of time talking about, and the speed of light is the rate at which the universe can communicate with itself. And the speed of sound is the mechanical rate at which air can communicate. If you\u2019re moving faster than the speed of sound, you\u2019re arriving before the molecules can get out of the way. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s a shock wave, because you\u2019re moving too fast. The speed of light is like, that\u2019s the speed limit. Now there\u2019s a speed of which an idea can move through a social-political economic fluid that we call a culture. How fast can an idea move through a culture? And it would be a function I think of cognitive bandwidth of human beings and distraction and life expectancy of human beings and how fast they speak with each other and how much you sleep. And if you ever look at animals, you ever see some of the animals, the smaller ones seem to move faster than either you or me? They\u2019re at a much different frequency. They can agree, disagree, careen into a brick wall, come back, regroup, careen into another one, agree again and move forward, all in the amount of time that we\u2019re deciding whether we should make a decision. It\u2019s a frequency. So there\u2019s a socio-political frequency, and in the history of science, the structure of scientific revolutions, they just speculate generally new paradigms they take place when the entire old generation dies, so in 30 years an entirely new group of decision-makers take over the government. The person running the army is 50, and the 20-year old will be running the army in 50 years because that\u2019s the life expectancy or the career expectancy. So normally it\u2019s life expectancy to take a paradigm shift, or a generation expectancy, so about 30 years. But sometimes if there\u2019s a way certain things get jammed faster and they get jammed faster because your life expectancy on Normandy Beach wasn\u2019t 30 years, right? If you do something egregiously \u2014 like assuming you cling to horses and you reject machine guns, that was an irrational behavior that could last from 1905 to 1914. But it didn\u2019t last from 1914 to 1915 because there was a war and it was like an instant consequence. So I think that war and disruption accelerates consequence. In the absence of that it\u2019s a generational thing, and then you\u2019d have to crank in the rate at which information moves now. For example I feel like information moves on YouTube much faster now than 5 years ago or 10 years ago. Information moves on Twitter faster."}

So information is moving at a broader scale, there\u2019s a much more competitive battle over ideas. Good ideas travel faster, mediocre ideas don\u2019t travel at all they get stamped out, the race is evolving a bit faster. But having said all that, like Warren Buffett has still got a lot of money, right? Has he listened to 10 hours of content on Bitcoin yet? Probably not, right? So somebody controls $100 billion and they haven\u2019t spent 10 hours thinking about it. So what happens? Well that $100 billion will be locked in the old system until some cataclysmic change takes place. So I think that it\u2019s reasonable to expect it takes a decade. And a decade is fast."}

And then we have fiat introduced\u2014and where does that take us?"}
{"link": "https://the-what-is-money-show.simplecast.com/episodes/wim047-the-saylor-series-episode-11-the-failures-of-fiat", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 11 | The Failures of Fiat", "text": "Michael Saylor 1:45\nIf I can\u2019t use gold, I need money that\u2019s going to be stronger and faster and smarter. So what is an example of stronger money? Well, I\u2019m in London. I have $100 million worth of money. I need to get it to Rome on a telegram, or I need to move it to Rome at the speed of a single horse, and I can\u2019t haul that much gold. So I use a letter of credit. If I can project money via some credit network \u2014 whether it\u2019s the Rothschilds network or it\u2019s an imperial network or something else \u2014 then I\u2019ve got stronger money, and I\u2019ve got faster money. And if I can offer you that money in return for 3% interest, it becomes smarter money \u2014 smarter meaning I created an application that does something complicated. Like when I give you money for 30 days and at the end of 30 days you have to pay it back to me plus 4%, I created a derivative of the base-layer money, or a security of sorts. So the ability to create securities and the ability to project them distances with speed enables a more sophisticated economy and it\u2019s good for economic productivity. Hence the idea of a fiat. And I think the earliest fiats were like [the] trading stations in the French territories of Canada. They had credits: credit systems on ships, merchant credit systems. There have always been private credit systems. And then eventually there became municipal credit systems, like the mayor of the city-state or something, or mayor of a hamlet, and then you get to statewide systems and federal systems and agency systems and who knows whether or not churches didn\u2019t generate their own credit systems. And we know in the military, the military generates credit systems. They\u2019ll have credit vouchers or travel vouchers in the military. I remember the airlines used to give you these tickets where you could fly \u201cspace available\u201d, and they would give them to their employees like flight attendants. So the flight attendants are able to use that and give one to their wife or husband. And they sell those things! There actually became a secondary market in travel vouchers because they had monetary value. And so you have private monies and you have public monies and then you have quasi-public monies from any kind of food stamp or institutional voucher or military voucher that gives you a right to something of value \u2014 [it] becomes money in and of its own, in time. So the real question is, Why does fiat fail? We know why it works. The reason it works better than gold is because you put it on a piece of paper, and ultimately the rise of databases along with the ability to shuffle paper around meant that it\u2019s a lot easier to create an application of fiat base-layer money \u2014 all I\u2019ve got to do is take a check. Every time I write a check, I created an application, right? \u201cHey, pay Robert Breedlove $792.27.\u201d Doing that in a fiat standard takes about 20 seconds. Creating $792.27 of gold is impossible for all but one in 100,000 people and would take a day. So it\u2019s pretty obvious why it works \u2014 because you can create applications faster, you can create more beautiful, complicated applications, types of credit, you can move them around faster. And you can travel with them further distances. And also, they don\u2019t invite violence to the same degree. A very famous example of a private money that was created in my youth was American Express traveler\u2019s checks. And I don\u2019t know if you remember American Express traveler\u2019s checks, they actually became popular before the credit card. If people were going to travel internationally, and you were going to go to some place, they would say, Well, before you go, you should convert your money into American Express traveler\u2019s checks. I mean, literally, this is a big business. And the number one use case was: that way, if you lose them or they\u2019re stolen, you can get them replaced. The idea was you were less likely to be robbed if you were carrying the traveler\u2019s check."}

And American Express made all their money because people would buy $100 million to traveler\u2019s checks and only redeem $95 million. And there was the float. And then there was the unredeemed amount. And that was the difference. People used to be very excited about these sorts of things. I mean a traveler\u2019s check is almost like a derivative of a derivative. The paper money is on top of the gold or itself, although now I guess paper money is the base-layer money, and the traveler\u2019s check was on top of that. People liked that idea, and then I suppose the credit card is just another example of a fiat application. The idea is: you would send your kid on vacation with a credit card feeling comfortable that you could reload the credit card if they ran out of money. But if your kid said, Dad, I need $25,000 in cash just in case I have an emergency and I need I need an emergency appendectomy or something like that \u2014 there\u2019s no way you want them traveling with that. And of course, they couldn\u2019t even get across the border with $10,000 of cash. So 99% of the world has more than $10,000 that they could put on a credit card. But nobody can take $10,000 in cash. So the fiat standard is appealing because of the portability of the purchasing power and because it doesn\u2019t invite violence. If someone steals your credit card, you can cancel the credit card. If they stole your traveler\u2019s checks, you could cancel the traveler\u2019s checks \u2014 things like that. It\u2019s like, Make sure you write down the serial numbers of your traveler\u2019s checks \u2014 all of these things. But why doesn\u2019t it work in the in the modern era? I mean the fundamental problem is: we start with inflation again \u2014 the government can create more of it. But here the inflation problem is not a minor problem like gold. It\u2019s a major problem. Instead of getting a guaranteed 2% inflation with an occasional 20%, you get a guaranteed \u2014 I think Saifedean suggested the number was more like 10-11% guaranteed. 7% guaranteed in the US, more in other countries. So you\u2019re getting a guaranteed inflation of somewhere between 7-11% a year, and you\u2019re getting occasional inflation of 30% or 40% a year. So the base-layer protocol doesn\u2019t work so well. It\u2019s not conservative. So if you have a shared ledger that\u2019s not conservative, it\u2019s collapsing. And there\u2019s just nothing \u2014 I say to people, there\u2019s no engineered machine or structure that works with that degree of error or inflation. If you had a 2% leak in your gas tank \u2014 over what period, right? If you\u2019re leaking 2% a day, your car won\u2019t work. So leakage of your swimming pool or a balloon or any kind of electrical system or any thermodynamic system at all, just doesn\u2019t work with that much leakage. So the inflation \u2014 ironically, right ?\u2014 inflation implies you\u2019re getting more but really, it\u2019s dilution, in a way. It\u2019s guaranteed dilution or depletion. So the first problem with fiat is it\u2019s just depleting energy at too rapid a rate. If we just said 10% a year on average, then a system which is losing 10% of its energy every single year or almost 1% a month \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a crippling first-order problem on the base-layer. It\u2019s almost like if I\u2019m building on sand, and the sand was sinking 10 feet a year. What structure can you build? When you\u2019re building on something, you want to build on granite and you want the minimum deflection. Granite doesn\u2019t deflect, steel doesn\u2019t deflect. Sand and clay deflects, swampland deflects. So the problem that we start with is the base-layer is collapsing. The second problem of the fiat standard is confiscation. The government can seize your currency or they can seize the asset. To a lesser extent other people can seize it. I mean if you carry your cash around there\u2019s that famous image of Pablo Escobar sitting and burning $100 bills to stay warm. If you can carry it around someone with a gun can seize it, so that\u2019s a problem. If you don\u2019t carry it around then the counter-party that you trusted it with \u2014 generally the bank \u2014 can seize it. And in all cases, generally the government can seize it. And so these are three fundamental defects with the fiat standard: (1) your property rights are weak under the confiscation risk, and (2) your property is defective because of the constant inflation. You literally bought swampland in Florida that\u2019s sinking. It\u2019s worse than that! Because swampland doesn\u2019t sink forever \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much as bad as it\u2019s gonna get. This is worse than that, because it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse."}

There\u2019s like a conundrum of money here, where this is the tool or the economic medium that\u2019s intended to be trust-minimized. So you can put your wealth there and you don\u2019t need to trust anyone else. It\u2019s like a safe place to park wealth. But to get that you come with all these limitations of gold, historically. So to pick up these stronger, faster, smarter qualities of money comes with a cost of counter-party risk. The conundrum is: gold, you can trust nobody \u2014 you don\u2019t need to trust anyone \u2014 but you can\u2019t really trade with anyone because of all of its limitations. Or you can use fiat, in which you need to trust a lot of counter-parties, but you can trade with a lot of people. So there\u2019s this conundrum we\u2019ve been stuck between, historically. And Bitcoin is the answer: it\u2019s the collapse of the counter-party risk."}

The counterparty risk is the explanation for inflation, right? The government\u2019s inflating it. And the counterparty risk is the root problem with confiscation. But again, even if you had your cash in your pocket, you don\u2019t have counterparty risk in the near term, but what you do have is an invitation to violence, it\u2019s too difficult to move it, then you\u2019ve got counterparty risk in the form of hypothecation, which is the third problem. Which is: you put your money in the bank \u2014 maybe they won\u2019t steal it \u2014 but they\u2019re making more of it because they\u2019re loaning it out with a reserve ratio of 1:10 or 1:20 and so you put a million in the bank and they create 10 million more which dilutes your million. So the hypothecation is the third failing of a fiat standard. The fourth is the authentication again, because remember we want to actually be able to move it distances, but you can\u2019t authenticate it over a distance in it\u2019s bearer instrument form, because you can\u2019t pay for something with cash. The way to authenticate it is through a counterparty. So I have to put my money in a bank, the bank has to issue a credit card, then I have to input the credit card into the website, then maybe the credit gets approved, then I have to do the transaction, and maybe the transaction gets approved, and maybe it doesn\u2019t get approved, and it doesn\u2019t cross all borders. It would be impossible to do a transaction via credit card with a vendor in Cuba, or Nigeria, or China, all sorts of places where if you cross central banks, the credit cards don\u2019t cross those jurisdictions. So that is another way of saying it\u2019s an authentication and a transportation problem. How do I transfer transport fiat currency? How do I transform transport a million dollars? Do you know any private individual that\u2019s ever moved a million in cash over a commercial airline? There\u2019s almost a presumption that if you had a million dollars of cash in your luggage that you\u2019re a criminal, right? Isn\u2019t that interesting? There\u2019s a presumption that if you try to do it yourself as a bearer instrument, that you\u2019re a criminal. And so what we have is we have a monopoly on transportation through the banks. But the banks only can really move within the central bank network, otherwise they have to cross central banks. So the monopoly is at the bank level, then the central bank level, and then the central banks answer to the government state departments. So the central bank of the US won\u2019t do business with the central bank of Cuba. Period. Won\u2019t happen. So transportation across jurisdiction is difficult and dangerous where it\u2019s possible. It either works \u2014 you\u2019re either in the zone where it\u2019s working, like you\u2019re in the US moving money between Bank of America and Citigroup at 3pm on a Tuesday \u2014 and then maybe it works. Although the truth is like I get denied, I try to do little credit card transactions between my credit card and my phone \u2014 I get denied like a third of the time."}

Anything like that. If it looks like it\u2019s a transfer. You get all sorts of limits on the rate at which you can move money. And if you want to go to higher volumes \u2014 if you wanted to move $50,000 or $100,000 \u2014 invariably you have to have a trusted banker, a human being that\u2019s calling you on the phone to move those wires. So the way that we move large sums of money is between 9pm and 5pm with a trusted banker with a manual authentication. I mean it feels to me like that hasn\u2019t changed in 30 years, right? So you can\u2019t move outside of the 9-to-5, and you can\u2019t do it without that trusted banker, and you can\u2019t cross any kind of technical jurisdiction or any kind of political jurisdiction that\u2019s not in their free-fly zone. And the result of that is that the impedance to move that money is extreme. So on one side it might take you 72 hours and the real cost is hundreds of dollars. On the other side, if we go back to the credit card network though, you have a monopoly in the credit card network and the result is a 2.5% credit card fee. So where the money does move, there\u2019s the 2.5% fee. And that\u2019s under the best of cases. But the remittance network gets up to 10% sometimes. So you\u2019ve got fees that range from 2.5% to 10%. If you\u2019re lucky, you get one of those cashback cards. And so the effective cashback is 1.5% or something. So the effective cost is only 1%.

And there\u2019s massive fraud charge-back issues."}

I think that your property is impaired. It is taxed. And it\u2019s either explicitly taxed by a government, a municipality, a state or federal government, or it\u2019s privately taxed by the money transfer network that\u2019s charging you a fee to move it around. And that\u2019s a challenge. So transportation: either difficult or dangerous or it\u2019s impossible or it\u2019s expensive. Those are the problems with that. And then that leads to two other real deficiencies in the fiat standard. One, you\u2019ve got a lot of credit failures, because lots of complex debt is layered on top of the base layer money. And that\u2019s complex debt and credit instruments with counterparty risk. Check kiting, check fraud, or any anything like that where someone\u2019s stood in to pay \u2014 lots of fraud and lots of credit failure \u2014 and then you\u2019ve got securities fraud. And with security fraud, what I mean by that is there\u2019s too many complex applications that are constructed based upon a counterpartys representation to you, and there\u2019s no way for you to transparently authenticate or assure yourself that the application is properly constructed and properly backed. And you\u2019re destined to have that. Someone says, Oh, we have $2 billion in reserves. But they don\u2019t \u2014 but you don\u2019t know they don\u2019t, and then there\u2019s a collapse of the securities they issued or the credit or the vouchers or whatever they issued. So that those things are inevitable. And the question is, Why? Why do you have credit bubbles? And then, Why do you have securities fraud on top of the fiat standard? And I think the answer \u2014 we come back to our base first principles \u2014 is: the base layer protocol of fiat is defective. The base layer money is defective. Is it a shared, immutable, correct, ledger? And the answer is, No. It\u2019s not shared. It\u2019s not immutable. It\u2019s not correct. It\u2019s an imperfectly, heterogeneously-shared, mutable, incorrect ledger. So I guess what you could say is it\u2019s a ledger, right?"}

You don\u2019t have final settlement so you have massive fraud on the credit card network, you have transfers that didn\u2019t take place that are represented to have taken place, you have balance sheets that don\u2019t exist that are represented to exist. You have an issue there with the base layer. The second problem you have is the application layer protocol \u2014 it\u2019s random and manual. So the protocol by which I would create applications is a base layer money. Like a security is an application, a credit card is an application. There\u2019s no technical protocol, or [it\u2019s not] programmable. There\u2019s no API. It\u2019s a manual protocol. So every single bank creates their own application. Like, a bank loan is an application of fiat. And every bank executes their own set of loans. And they\u2019re all expected to maintain a certain degree of reserves, right? But they\u2019re audited. And the fact that they have to be audited is proof that they\u2019re all just manually executed and heterogeneous. So there\u2019s no transparent, perfected application protocol. And the implication of that is that the applications in the fiat standard have no integrity in a mathematical sense, or a technical sense, or an engineering sense. A physical metaphor is: in the real world, I\u2019m standing on solid ground. And in the fiat world, my eyes are closed and someone told me I could take two steps to the left and I would be standing on solid ground. But I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m standing on solid ground. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m 100 feet from the cliff \u2014 I might be one foot from the cliff. Someone told me, and I don\u2019t have a protocol to ascertain whether it is true or not true. So you could generously say people just make mistakes all the time \u2014 I thought you were 10 feet from the cliff, and you only were nine and so that\u2019s why you\u2019re dead. Maybe it\u2019s just an honest mistake, right? But then again, maybe it was in my vested interest to tell you you\u2019re 10 feet from the cliff and you were really 5 feet from the cliff."}

Don\u2019t trust, verify. And the securities fraud you\u2019re describing culminates in the weapons of financial mass destruction with this huge gigantic derivatives market, which is really premised, I would argue, largely on this gap we have between trade and settlement in the fiat system. There\u2019s no final settlement occurring, which is the verification mechanism. So in that gap, we have an accumulation of hidden risk that ultimately becomes systemic and leads to giant systemic blow ups. And to your point about there being no integrity, it\u2019s like, Of course there\u2019s no integrity. I would say the lack of integrity is synonymous with corruptibility. And so not only does it not have mathematical integrity or financial Integrity but you could ultimately say there\u2019s no moral integrity because these systems just don\u2019t hold up to corruption."}

So therefore, I trust it to the bank. I take their gold derivative and I assume that that is base layer money. And I can\u2019t take delivery of a billion dollars of fiat currency, so therefore I entrust it to the bank and I take their credit instrument as my base layer money. And you could say that what you\u2019ve got is two fundamental shortcomings here that cause these two systems to break. One is (1): the base layer protocol is defective. You need a base layer protocol where you can take final settlement at any scale. Can you take final settlement of $387? Can you take final settlement of $38 million? Can you take final settlement of $38 billion? Can you take final settlement every day? If you can take final settlement at any scale at any frequency, then the underlying gold standard or fiat standard would have some integrity \u2014 at least a modicum. The second problem is (2): there\u2019s no application protocol. So there\u2019s no way to create a security or derivative or some layer 2 application on top of the layer 1 monetary token. We need the applications, right? The world needs more than just base layer money, like you need credit, or you want yield, or you want to build an insurance contract, or maybe you need to be able to post a security deposit and you need to be able to get the security deposit back, or maybe you want to put something in trust with a multisignature arrangement for 37 years. There are lots of applications that make the world work. But there\u2019s no application protocol. So in both cases with gold and fiat, the base layer protocol is defective, and the application protocol is either non-existent or defective. And what makes Bitcoin special, and what makes it digital money is: Bitcoin gives you a base layer protocol to take final settlement, and it gives you an application-level protocol too. We could debate back and forth, right? Is the application protocol on the base chain \u2014 the blockchain? If so, it\u2019s a Bitcoin transfer. Or is the application protocol on Lightning? You know, using a layer 2. Either of those could be viewed as an application protocol."}

So I think the core \u2014 and this is so critical \u2014 if people can understand this, the antifragility of the world economy is dependent on this simple fact: if we can have higher frequency final settlement, we can have more verifiability in the economic structure, which means less corruption and less blow ups. Whereas the fiat system right now is the complete reverse of that: very low frequency final settlement, very low verifiability, tons of corruption, lots of blow ups."}

Every single second, gravity is testing your structure and testing your orientation. There\u2019s that phrase, Can you defy gravity? And the answer is: Maybe if you\u2019re a great athlete \u2014 for a second or two, right? For a very short period of time can you defy gravity. It requires extraordinary strength, extraordinary agility, and it still comes at great peril. You could try to do a backflip and you can land on your head and you can break your back and you\u2019ll be dead or paralyzed for life within a couple of seconds. So there is a final settlement. If you\u2019re considering a crypto-asset network like Bitcoin \u2014 and Bitcoin is the greatest, maybe the only successful example but certainly the greatest example of a crypto-asset network \u2014 the frequency parameter and the block size parameter for a crypto-asset network is the equivalent to the space-time constants in a universe. So the 10-minute frequency, that\u2019s how fast the universe evolves. And the block size is the gravitational content, what is the relationship between mass and energy and how tightly packed is matter? And once you\u2019ve established those two constants, you\u2019ve defined the constants that run the universe. Everything else evolves around those two constants. This is why you would never want to change them, because changing them is playing God. And you only get to play God once. When you start the universe, if you change the frequency and the block size of Bitcoin, you invalidate all work that\u2019s come before, you imperil all structures that have formed in the universe since the beginning of time, you impair every mechanism that\u2019s been created within that set of structures \u2014 you impair them and maybe break them \u2014 and you throw the future into chaos. All of those things. I mean it couldn\u2019t be clearer to me, but if you want the physical metaphor it\u2019s like, What if I triple gravity on the surface of the Earth right now? If I could snap my fingers and triple gravity? How many pieces of furniture do you have that crumple? How many chairs collapse? How many people\u2019s hearts stop? How many ships sink? How many planes fly? How many factories keep working? Stuff breaks \u2014 not just factories start breaking, buildings start collapsing, bridges collapse, tires deflate. The person that worked for 100 years to create that great company or the Rockefeller Center and it just crumbles? So you worked for 100 years and you did something and it was beautiful until everybody\u2019s dead. What happened? Well you changed the gravitational constant, you changed the space-time constant, and therefore the structure which had been carefully constructed since all of eternity forward, the structure is now rendered null and void and it collapses. Ships are designed based on the Reynolds number. There\u2019s something called a hull speed. And the hull speed is a function of the shape of the hull, and that\u2019s a function of the way that fluid flows. These are basic constants. And no matter how fast you push that hull, it won\u2019t go any faster because the water pushes back as hard as you push it. That\u2019s why a 150-foot vessel that\u2019s 30-feet wide will cruise it 12.5 or 13 knots and it doesn\u2019t matter the horsepower of the engine in it. It\u2019s just the way that the world works. Another example of that is shock-waves and the speed of sound. There\u2019s a reason for the speed of sound \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a it\u2019s a fundamental constant. You go faster than the speed of sound, then you\u2019re moving faster than the air can move out of the way? You get a shock-wave. Lot\u2019s of devastation. What happens if you change the speed of sound? What if you changed the speed of light?"}

Satoshi set the rules. And the strategies we build based on those constants, they are dependent on the invariance of those constants. If you go and change them then all the strategies that have been built up around them collapse."}

If you increase the block size, the transaction revenues collapse. If the transaction revenues collapse, the Bitcoin mining profitability collapses. If the Bitcoin mining collapses, the energy usage collapses. If the security collapses, the network collapses. You know what\u2019s going on with some of the proof of stakers is: if you flip from proof of work to proof of stake, you destroy your entire mining industry. If you destroy your entire mining industry, all of the security \u2014 all the social, political, economic, thermo-dynamic security \u2014 collapses. If it collapses, the integrity and the durability of the money collapses. There are all sorts of second-order, third-order, fourth-order consequences to this. The fundamental basis and integrity is: one has to know that God is not going to change the rules on you if you spend your entire life working on something. If you want to drive people insane, change the rules. Like if I just change the speed of light and the speed of sound and I quintuple gravity before you compete in the Olympics? And then when your competitors start competing I dial down gravity to the moon gravity and they jump 180 feet in the air and they beat you. You\u2019re like, Well that guy had moon gravity and I had Saturn gravity and my legs are broken and my hips are broken and I\u2019m lying on a gurney with an IV in my arm and my heart is about to stop. And the other dude is bounding over the stadium. It doesn\u2019t seem quite fair! Okay, at some point when the Gods toy with you like that, you say, \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to play this game anymore.\u201d And people withdraw from the ecosystem. It\u2019s like, what would you do other than run as fast as you could away from a random universe that wanted to kill you?"}

It\u2019s the first unchangeable set of rules we\u2019ve ever had. So it\u2019s causing us all to reorient our strategies. Whereas fiat is a constant changing of the rules.

When there were a hundred HODLers it was something, when there was a million it was more immutable, when there was a hundred-million it was more immutable. When the Bitcoin mining spreads further, when the HODLers spread further, when there are more institutions and organizations and jurisdictions HODLing \u2014 the more it spreads, the more immutable it gets, and therefore the higher degree of confidence you can have in the integrity of the entire thing.

People are reporting that it completely reshaped their worldview. Sent them down the rabbit hole. It\u2019s been very valuable. And so I commend you for that. And I think the right place to jump in here today \u2014 since we\u2019re taking the big picture approach \u2014 is to just answer the question, what is money?"}
{"link": "https://whatismoneypodcast.com/episodes/wim044-the-saylor-series-episode-10-the-death-of-gold-BOYcEbbo", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 10 | The Death of Gold", "text": "Michael Saylor 1:49\nYou know, I never in my life had anybody asked me that question before you asked it to me the first time for our first series? And when you asked me that question, that catalyzed the whole set of thinking. And it got me thinking: money is energy. And of course we did the nine-part series and we spent a lot of time talking about energy systems and engineering as a discipline of manipulating energy and why it was critical to the human race and the human condition. And so we won\u2019t re-cover any of that, because that\u2019s well-trod territory. But coming back to the question of what is money and just focusing on it, I would say, for our round two or part two of this series, I\u2019d say: money is tokenized energy within a socio-political framework. So we know money is energy. But tokenized energy \u2014 that is: a dollar is a measure of energy, a gold coin is a measure of energy, a bale of tobacco that you\u2019re trading is a token of energy. And how much energy? Well, that\u2019s where the socio-political framework comes in. You can you can measure actual physical or engineering energy and its objective, but money ends up being to a certain degree subjective because if I show up on a deserted island and I\u2019ve got a stack of gold coins and everybody has guns, and they\u2019re shooting each other, they might not accept my gold coin. Whereas if I actually offer the bullets for their gun, they might think the bullets are actually better money than the gold coin, just like cigarettes are good money and in a POW camp, but gold coins wouldn\u2019t be. So this question of what is money gets you really going. So if money is tokenized energy within a social-political framework, then we can look over the history of mankind and we realize that we\u2019ve chosen many different ways to tokenize that energy, and we\u2019ll skip through most of them because they came and they went, but there are three that popped to mind that are interesting. One is the gold standard. The second is the fiat standard. And the third is the Bitcoin standard. And when you start asking what is money, you start asking, well, what\u2019s the best monetary system? And we\u2019ve got these three systems to talk about. I think one thing that\u2019s pretty clear is that most people can\u2019t get their heads around Bitcoin because it\u2019s an utter paradigm shift. And why is it a paradigm shift? Well, because I think Bitcoin is the first digital money. It\u2019s the first digital money. Gold wasn\u2019t digital money and fiat is not digital money, either. And so economists and politicians and investors, they all lack the right mental model to understand Bitcoin because science and engineering were so intrinsic to gold that we took it for granted, because gold is a 10-pound lump of something and if you if you get slugged in the head with it, nobody had to explain that science and physics mattered. And then science and engineering kind of became like quasi-irrelevant in the fiat world. Everybody just kind of ignored science and engineering and there were no immediate clear consequences. There were just the hyperinflations and the collapses of those fiat systems. But because they abandoned gold and there was no digital money, the only alternative to one fiat, you know, the Weimar Republic fiat currency, was the [British] Pound. And that alternative was an alternative to the next thing and the next thing. So we\u2019re comparing fiat currencies or fiat monies to each other. And so there was no real need to embrace science and engineering. And Bitcoin is this paradigm shift where we have digital money crashing into, I guess what we\u2019ll call analog money, or maybe a political money is a better way to describe it. And now we start to ask the question again, what is money? And I think tokenized energy isn\u2019t good enough to explain what is money. Another way to describe money is by coming back to the ideal model. What is the ideal model of money? Ideal money is a shared, immutable, correct ledger. You know, you\u2019ve heard the phrase, Bitcoin is a shared immutable ledger and people debate about whether it\u2019s truly immutable or not, but a crypto-asset network, fully decentralized and mature, is the closest thing we can get to an immutable shared ledger in the history of the world. I think a lot of times when people describe it as a shared immutable ledger, they leave off the correct or the mathematically correct, because it\u2019s almost implied. But I think that if you were to focus upon the three critical dimensions of ideal money, you would say: (1) it\u2019s a ledger that\u2019s shared, everybody in the political system has to have the same access to the ledger. (2) It has to be immutable, no one can doctor it. But it has to be (3) correct, mathematically complete or mathematically proper, because if it\u2019s incomplete or incorrect, then it\u2019s not ideal money. So if I take that as a model, money is a shared immutable, correct ledger, then I can imagine the perfect money would be: some godlike being comes down on earth and they create this perfect uncorruptible system and they telepathically drop that shared immutable correct ledger into the heads of every human being. And every time you incur a debt, it updates the ledger and when you incur a credit, it updates the ledger. And no one can corrupt the ledger."}

You kind of need it to keep track of your music rights or your video rights or your movie rights on your iTunes Store. What do you own? Or the right registrations and licenses? Can I enter a building? Can I exit? Can I cross a border? What are my rights? And what are my obligations? And what do I own? And what do I share, and it all comes down to just a shared database, but that database needs to be immutable and correct. And that is property, the essence of property. And I suppose, when you own a piece of property, and you buy it \u2014 a piece of land five acres somewhere, then there\u2019s a deed and you go and you file the deed with the courthouse. And that\u2019s kind of critical, right. And so much of property law revolves around making sure that there are no liens on the property before I buy it, making sure that you have the proper title to it. And that you can transfer that title. And I think that money, to your point, it\u2019s kind of like the apex property, it\u2019s the sum of all property or at least it\u2019s the most important property, I suppose, because it would be the property that I could use to trade for any other property. Any other property or any other product or service. So that is my tokenized energy."}

Is that money because the most important person in the village said it\u2019s money? Or is that money because the best engineer offered it as money? Satoshi engineered money. Whereas, every government has created money. So if we start with that model, right: shared immutable correct [money]. And now we go back to all the monetary systems in history. Start with ancient coins, right? Coin networks, well there have been so many coin networks starting with the Lydians. Each coin network is: well I have a gold coin, I have a silver coin, I have a copper coin, oftentimes, there\u2019s three different coins, you know, one for 1,000, one for 10, one for 1, they have to be at three different scales. And the shortcoming is you create a system of coinage or custom tokens, and then you start shuffling them around in a network, you can only trade to the extent that you have those tokens. And if people lose the tokens the money is gone. But then people try to counterfeit the tokens, they try to cut the coins different ways. Eventually the coins might wear down, the coins have to be carried. And so why do all these coin systems fail? I guess on one hand, there\u2019s never enough of them. There\u2019s always a limit. On the other hand, they\u2019re discrete. So you can go from 1000 to 100 to a 10, or from 1000 to a 10 to a 1 but how do you get to a 0.1 or 0.01 when you want to get to orders of magnitude more or you want to make change in the middle. You end up with all these money changers, and the result of the money changing is a huge amount of friction or impedance. And for thousands of years, people couldn\u2019t figure out how to manufacture coins that couldn\u2019t be cut or counterfeited or that were durable and so ultimately, every single mercantile system has its own internal coin system. And when you swap from one system to the second, there\u2019s this money changer in the middle and they take you for 10%. I remember traveling from London to Rome back before the EU was formed, Robert, and I showed up with dollars, and I converted my dollars into pounds. And then I think I took a plane to the Netherlands and I converted my pounds to whatever the Dutch currency was. And I went to Belgium and I converted the Dutch currency to the Belgian currency. And then we went through France, I converted it again. And then we went to Italy and I converted again, I ended up with like 50% of what I started with after about 72 hours!"}

So there\u2019s this problem we\u2019ve always had, transforming one form of energy into another and back."}

And then there\u2019s loss over time as people counterfeit the coins, and you can\u2019t tell. And then there\u2019s losses as the coins get debased. And so the result is what, like 5,000 different systems of coinage over time. And every one of them struggled. Ultimately, they were the basis of the gold standard. And we have this myth that there was a gold standard, the good old days, but it seems like the gold standard never worked as far as we can find anywhere. I mean, we have the stories of the Romans debasing their coinage and the collapse of the Roman Empire. And we know the Lydians eventually lost theirs. And we know there must have been hundreds of systems of coinage in Greece, and one city would sack another city and melt down their coins and create the next set of coins. So I mean there\u2019s a problem with the whole idea of coinage. And the problem with coinage is it\u2019s based on metal \u2014 metallic money. And of course, the highest form of money is the gold. So let\u2019s say it\u2019s called the gold standard. But what\u2019s the problem with the gold standard? I mean it never worked that well, because it\u2019s got some crippling flaws, and just some nagging flaws. There\u2019s inflation. Inflation is a nagging defect, it doesn\u2019t inflate fast, it inflates slow, but it inflates at 2% or 3% a year. And because it\u2019s inflating, because you\u2019re mining more gold, and you\u2019re striking more coins or whatever it is you\u2019re moving around, it\u2019s not conservative. And by that I mean it\u2019s not mathematically conservative, or it\u2019s not conservative from a scientific point of view. You start with 100 units, and then you\u2019ve got 102 units, and then 105 units, and 108 units. So whatever percentage of the gold supply you have is leaking at 2% to 3% a year. And it could be worse if it\u2019s not a closed system. So if anybody introduces new gold into the system like when the Spaniards found the Inca gold and they brought back the gold from the New World, you get a massive inflation. I think I remember reading a history of Caesar where when he came back after the Gallic Wars, he had seized so much gold that that created a hyperinflation in Rome and the interest rates leaped. And there was just too much money. And so, either there is inflation because you seized gold or another nation flooded your market with gold, or there\u2019s inflation because the gold mining process continues. And so against our ideal model of money, that means that gold\u2019s not mathematically correct. It\u2019s not conservative, nor is it correct. It\u2019s an approximation. Under the best of circumstances, it\u2019s got a 2% error a year and so over the course of a decade, the best of circumstances is like a 20%, 25% error rate. But the worst of circumstances is: I double or triple the amount of gold when I come back from sacking the Aztecs or the Incas, or I sacked Gaul and I just brought back all this gold and so then you\u2019ve just got a massive error. So gold is mathematically erroneous because you\u2019re just shuffling metallic tokens and it\u2019s not a closed system. The second problem with gold is confiscation because it\u2019s physical. The custodial rights of gold aren\u2019t really \u2014 they\u2019re not great. I guess they\u2019re a little bit better than fiat currency. But in some ways they\u2019re not as good. If I have a lot of gold, if I have a million dollars worth of gold or $10 million worth of gold, it\u2019s heavy \u2014 really heavy. I can\u2019t get it through an airport. I don\u2019t even know like \u2014 you know I tried to \u2014 I went online on Amazon once a few years ago and I wanted a little pocket knife. And I ordered this pocket knife \u2014 you know how pretty much you can only carry a blade, which is like, I don\u2019t know, half an inch long or what\u2019s the number? It\u2019s like some infinitesimally small sized blade, like a quarter inch or a half an inch blade. So I went on Amazon and I found someone advertising this really super small, dinky little knife that you could use to cut a string with. And it was advertised as being a TSA friendly, compliant little pocket knife. And I was so proud of myself, because I must have paid like $39 for it. And then I took it to the airport to go through the metal detector. And I swear that the TSA agent stopped \u2014 you know, I put all this stuff through, they stopped the luggage and said like, Show me that. And they pulled out this little half inch blade to slice a string with, like, Sir, you can\u2019t take this with you. And of course the defense of: Amazon said it\u2019s okay didn\u2019t really fly. Right? And the point of the story is, you can\u2019t even slip a needle-like metal blade through an airport. I wonder if you could carry five gold coins and get away with it? Or ten gold coins, if you can\u2019t get my little pen knife thing through? And so the answer is: it\u2019s easy to confiscate [gold coins], custodial rights are really weak. The fundamental problem with the gold standard is, the custody is difficult and the security is hyper-expensive. And by hyper-expensive, it\u2019s \u2014 how much does it cost to secure a billion dollars worth of this stuff? Like you hire 24 armed guards and you have a vault in Fort Knox?"}

And the security cost scales in some ways exponentially with the amount you have. And also with the number of nodes. If I have 100,000 nodes, I have 100,000 points of failure. And so it scales with the number of nodes, the value of the nodes and the velocity of the nodes, or the velocity of the money, right? If I wanted to move a billion dollars of gold every day of the week, for 365 days in a row, 1,000 miles. Figure out the security cost of that, right? The conclusion is, this money is so heavy it has no velocity. It goes into Fort Knox, it sits there for 30 years, and nobody audits it. And under that circumstance you can almost delude yourself into saying it\u2019s secure. But it\u2019s only secure because there\u2019s no money velocity and there\u2019s no distribution. If I wanted to give gold to 8 billion people and wanted to move it every day, then the cost of the security would go up to consume all of the energy that humanity produces, right? Probably the cost of security for 8 billion people moving gold every day is more than the sum of the entire gross national product of the world. So the security cost doesn\u2019t work \u2014 doesn\u2019t scale."}

So gold is functioning as an asset but it\u2019s not useful as a currency, something that circulates. Therefore, we introduce a currency. And the other thing on gold, I guess it\u2019s the best approximation of that immutable ledger that you described as ideal money. But it has still has this error rate for both inflation, which is relatively small, but the bigger error rate has to do with the violence and confiscation risk, that it\u2019s unpredictable when the market is going to be flooded, or if you\u2019re going to be confiscated, or if your custodian is trustworthy, etc."}

It\u2019s tokenized energy. And it was the best idea for tokenizing energy in the Bronze Age, I suppose. But it\u2019s not a [mathematically] correct token. And because it\u2019s so easy to confiscate, it\u2019s not really a shared ledger anymore. It\u2019s not shared tokens, right? I can\u2019t share it because I can\u2019t carry it with me. And then that leads us to the third problem with it, which is the hypothecation. It\u2019s too easy to counterfeit and manipulate. And it\u2019s easy to counterfeit because I can either debase the coins themselves, or I can lie about the asset in the vault while I give you a gold note. I either create the gold note and I lie about it or I just debase the coin, and that creates a problem of authenticity. And that leads us to the fourth problem, which is authentication. It\u2019s too expensive to audit and authenticate. In fact, out of everybody that I know, I don\u2019t know a single person that\u2019s ever authenticated a gold coin. You wouldn\u2019t know! Coinage was an attempt to make authentication self-evident. Right? And Isaac Newton worked on how do you create a good coin, and most coins were crappy, but we still struggle with this issue. And so if you can\u2019t authenticate it, then that really undermines the \u201cshared\u201d part of the shared ledger as well, and maybe the correct part. And so transportation is also a defect. It\u2019s too expensive and slow and difficult and dangerous to move. And distribution\u2019s a defect because it\u2019s difficult to move, difficult to authenticate and easy to confiscate. Then that means: how do you distribute it? It\u2019s too difficult to distribute, and too expensive to distribute. And when I talk about distribute I mean, how do I give it to a billion people? Right? I mean, practically speaking, if you distribute up to $1,000 of gold coins to a billion people today, there would be a 35% markup/markdown every time it trades, right? You pay $90 for $60 worth of gold. If you have $60 worth of gold, you\u2019d be lucky to sell it for $40. And so that transfer cost is obscene. And then finally, you\u2019ve got this division issue. How do you divide a one ounce gold coin? You can\u2019t. And so I can\u2019t divide it. So I have to create silver coin and copper coin. And now I never have the right combination of change. So prices don\u2019t work quite right. So gold has \u2014 fundamentally, it\u2019s the best tokenized energy in the Bronze Age. But because of all of these defects, by the Middle Ages it was clear it was going to be replaced with some some type of fiat or some kind of checking system or other paper ledger system. It\u2019s not clear to me that they didn\u2019t replace it \u2014 I talked about the gold myth \u2014 it\u2019s not clear to me they didn\u2019t replace the 2,000 years ago. Like they talk about the Sumerian tablets, right, and the Sumerian tablets of clay \u2014 they have ledgers on them. So, isn\u2019t it quite possible, if not likely, that we had checking systems or ledger systems that were privately enforced by banks thousands and thousands of years ago. So the gold myth is: there never was a gold standard. There was never a time when all money was gold. What you had was a time when the principal asset for a store of value over the long duration was gold. And it\u2019s quite likely that you always had \u2014 you know, the merchant had their ledger and you would have credit with the merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the ancient Roman merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the town. Or maybe that was a credit \u2014 if you were on a ship, anybody that\u2019s ever been on a ship sailing for months at a time, the quartermaster has all the supplies. And if you wanted some of those cigarettes or some of that alcohol, they might let you sign it out, but then they charge your account. And when the voyage is over, they debit it against your wages. And so this has been going on for as long as people have been sailing ships around. What we have is the myth of the gold standard, but we\u2019ve always had an asset currency system, and the currency was a checking system with a central counter-party \u2014 we can call them banks today. But we had goldsmiths that had gold notes back in the Middle Ages. And I think you\u2019ve always had merchants, and you\u2019ve always had quartermasters. And you\u2019ve always had the guy in the army that said, You lose it, we\u2019re going to dock your wages for that, whatever it is you lost or you spent or you consumed."}

But it can only be used for large transactions, essentially, because the economics don\u2019t make sense to use it for small transactions. So it doesn\u2019t circulate well but you can settle large transactions with it. So due to that technological limitation of gold \u2014 effectively it had such a high value to weight [ratio], I guess you might say \u2014 that we needed these cheaper systems, these credit systems or derivative systems \u2014 systems of deferred settlement built up around it. And that has been kind of the problem throughout history, because we have this system for final settlement, but we build systems of deferred settlement around it, which are economically more efficient.

So I think you can create a trust network that goes about 10 miles or 20 miles \u2014 a trust network out to the suburbs. And then once you get beyond the suburbs, the trust breaks down. And if the trust breaks down, that means you\u2019ve got Renaissance Italy, with 100 different city-states and they\u2019ve all got their own little system of trust and ledgers and coinage. And there is no universal money. And so you can\u2019t have an easy rise of the nation-state under a gold standard or a coinage standard, or at least it\u2019s kind of challenging!"}

And if you have a better money, you have a better economy. And as the money gets \u2014 if we come back to this issue of: Is it shared? Is it immutable? Is it correct? The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more correct. The more effective the economy, the faster the network updates, the faster the economy. So just finishing up on gold \u2014 why does gold fail? In theory \u2014 why does gold fail in theory? It fails because the base layer protocol is okay. It\u2019s kind of God-given by nature. It\u2019s the creation and the smelting of gold. It\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not conservative. The base layer protocol is not conservative. The application level protocol \u2014 that one layer above the base layer, the layer 2 \u2014 the application protocol is difficult and dangerous. But what does that mean? Like so I give you 10 blocks of gold. That\u2019s the base layer. Okay, well, so what are all the applications of gold? What can you do with it? How many people do you know that can actually refine or melt down molten gold and create something with it? That\u2019s the dangerous part and the difficult part. So gold applications, they\u2019re difficult and they\u2019re limited by the laws of physics. And that just means that \u2014 and there is no application protocol. So if I want to do anything with gold above the layer 1 it\u2019s either a very difficult, dangerous application like gold goblets or gold coins or something like that, or I have to create the equivalent of a gold [paper] check, which is a manually implemented protocol. And now we\u2019ve got the same problems we have with a fiat currency. At the point you implement a gold check, you\u2019ve in essence moved on to the Fiat standard with a gold reserve of some sort. So gold fails primarily because there\u2019s no good application protocol. It\u2019s not conservative, it\u2019s too difficult, too slow, too dangerous. And the physicality of it invites violence. I can literally firebomb the city, kill everybody in it, and the gold won\u2019t be damaged. And so when in doubt, shoot first, and then sift through your clothing and take your gold! I don\u2019t have to worry about any collateral damage. The last thing in the world you want to do is be carrying around immutable money on your person. When someone has an incentive just to kill the people and take the money. So that\u2019s the fundamental problem with gold. That\u2019s why the gold standard ultimately has always just been an invitation to war. And never-ending. I think thousands and thousands and thousands of wars \u2014 many wars, right? And an invitation to criminality and an invitation to violence. If the criminals don\u2019t take your gold then the counter-parties take your gold and the counter-parties don\u2019t take your gold then your own government takes your gold and your own government doesn\u2019t take your gold the hostile government takes your gold. But ultimately, gold \u2014 because of its physicality \u2014 is imperfect property. It is imperfect property. And it\u2019s imperfect money, because the token itself is so cumbersome and unwieldy to utilize."}

There\u2019s still massive gold flows taking place geopolitically while those nations are at war. So it\u2019s almost \u2014 I think it\u2019s an ill-understood aspect of human history that a lot of the violence between countries has been over the gold or about the gold. But it\u2019s not often discussed in the history books."}

I could give you 5,000 accounts of: we sacked the city, we burned it and we took their gold. We might have sacked the city and hauled the people off in slavery. We might have taken their livestock, we prefer to take \u2014 normally the livestock is all dead by the time we take the city though. So the people are dead, the cattle are dead, the food is gone, the water is all gone, but the gold is still there! So generally, if you look at the first 5,000 years, it\u2019s: we sacked the city, we took the gold. Then even in the modern era from 1700, 1800, 1900: We sacked the city. Okay, what do we make off with? There\u2019s not that many diamonds \u2014 normally they\u2019re not easy to find. There\u2019s not a lot of that. Sometimes, you know, the Nazis took the art, right? And the Nazi took the gold. And so there\u2019s a lot of that: we took the gold from the Treasury, Stalin seized the gold during the Spanish Civil War, and the Poles had to smuggle their gold away to keep it from the Nazis. And there\u2019s all sorts of examples of somebody sacking some city or rolling over someone\u2019s border to take their gold. That\u2019s because it\u2019s take-able, right? It\u2019s like, why do you want to take it? Because it\u2019s take-able. But not a single example [for paper currencies]. Like the Nazis didn\u2019t want Norwegian paper currency. They didn\u2019t want Swiss paper currency, they didn\u2019t want the Dutch or the French paper currency. And not many people ask the question, Why? We didn\u2019t take their checks. We didn\u2019t take their securities. Because at the end of the day, securities and derivatives and all these things have no value. Maybe the factory has value. If it\u2019s not destroyed. Maybe the people have value if you get them to work for you. The gold has value but the paper doesn\u2019t."}

But it doesn\u2019t get reported a lot in political history or even military history. I mean some nations successfully did it to the US but we don\u2019t want to talk about it, right? So you won\u2019t read that much but it\u2019s an effective thing you could do. Well anyway, that ends my thoughts on gold. It\u2019s basically a metallic token, and it was our best idea, but it seems to have stopped working thousands of years ago. You could say 2,000 years ago almost certainly they had shared ledgers. And they just used gold as a method of final settlement. And we know that it failed at different points. We know that it was debased and resulted in the collapse of the Roman Empire. And so if Rome was the greatest empire on Earth, when their final settlement network failed, then the empire collapsed and what you have is: history is the endless succession of successive empires rising up with the new gold standard that was not debased, and then generation after generation the coinage of that next empire \u2014 the successor empire \u2014 would be debased, and then that empire would fail and collapse. And then another empire would come along and they would start the cycle over and over again. And yet the myth of gold as immutable money or the sovereign store of value \u2014 it stayed with us for thousands of years into the 20th century. I would say that the gold standard has been dying a slow death \u2014 a death by a thousand cuts. 1914 comes along \u2014 you know we\u2019ve got the golden age from 1870\u20131914 but then World War I comes along and then in 1914 every country abandons the gold standard. And maybe that\u2019s the final cut. And after World War I, the Treaty of Genoa, we came back to a gold reserve standard and in essence we had gold backing the pound and the dollar. And that degree of backing successively slid, so there was a debasement of the pound and the dollar, consistently and gradually. And then of course the pound and the dollar became layer 2 applications if you will, and then every other currency became a layer 3 derivative. And then everything else in the economy was built on those derivatives, so you had basically layers of derivatives of gold that got progressively less backed by tangible energy \u2014 or de-nurtured. And that resulted in who knows how many collapses: the Great Depression. Eventually we get World War II which you could say came out of just a bunch of economic collapses like the Weimar Republic. And all the gold ended up getting centralized and seized by the Americans in Fort Knox, and then we wrapped Bretton Woods around it, and Bretton Woods was the second gold reserve standard of the century, except this time just the dollar was the reserve currency, backed some percentage by gold \u2014 say 40% or 30% by gold. And then every year thereafter it slid from 40% to 30% to 20% \u2014 I shudder to say it must have been less than 10% by 1971. And in 1971 we defaulted on the gold standard. In essence, at that point the gold reserve standard was effectively dead. Gold still has a fiction of being a store of value and an asset, and if you\u2019re looking for a non-sovereign store of value between 1971 and the invention of Bitcoin, you could\u2019ve gone to gold, I guess you could\u2019ve used property like land or commodities, timber rights, oil rights, something like that. And you could\u2019ve used art. There\u2019s probably no one king, right? People dabble with, Is silver a store of value? I think the free market went back and forth but it\u2019s pretty clear that gold kind of died \u2014 it started dying if not had died about 10 years ago as far as I can see, when Bitcoin was formed. And if we look at performance in the last 12 months, just for kicks let\u2019s just go and look at 12 months of performance. So it\u2019s quite a day, right? In 12 months Bitcoin is up 240%. Gold is down 9.82%. Over the course of 10 years Bitcoin is up 132% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), gold is 0.94%. The S&P Index is 13.9% over 10 years. 33% over one year. Summary is: gold is not a store of value over the last decade, it\u2019s something opposite of a store of value. If the S&P is up 33% in 12 months, then a reasonable surrogate for the collapse of purchasing power of the currency in 12 months is the inverse of that, right? But you could say you need 33.7% more money to buy the same share of the S&P. So a store of value has to clock at 33% or better, and gold is -40%, and Bitcoin is +200%. So that\u2019s the marketplace screaming at you that no-one really sees gold as a monetary asset anymore except for the gold bugs."}

One of the key points that jumps out at me here \u2014 getting back to your framework of ideal money \u2014 is that: immutable quality necessitates a proof of work, and gold again was just the best approximation of that. That\u2019s really the only thing that ever made gold money was the proof of work necessary to produce it. It was just really difficult to produce, therefore it minimized counter-party risk."}

Sometimes they would like fly to a branch and they couldn\u2019t land on a branch. They were literally so stupid they couldn\u2019t land on a branch, they could barely fly fast, a lot of them would just accidentally fly into the dirt and slam into the dirt. So when you looked at them and you compared them to other insects, you saw that those other insects are so much better at flying. You take it for granted, but you never really think, Oh those birds are good at flying, they\u2019re fast and strong and smart. Until you see something that isn\u2019t fast and isn\u2019t strong and isn\u2019t smart. And you might say, Well this thing is pretty much history! How could it possibly survive? And the answer is: they all have to birth once every 17 years, and there\u2019s a million of them in the air, and they\u2019re all so stupid and slow and inept that they\u2019re definitely going to die, but all the other creatures aren\u2019t going to be able to kill them fast enough to keep some of them from procreating."}

So in a world without computers and without cryptography and without networks, you ask yourself: What are you going to do next? The answer is: I\u2019m going to come up with a shared ledger \u2014 I do have math. We\u2019ve got algebra. We got calculus. I do have writing. I can create a shared ledger. And the immutable part is going to come from the institutional credibility. The credibility of the proprietor and the reputation of the proprietor, whether that\u2019s a king or a mayor or an owner or a religion. But the immutability and the credibility comes from an institutional human source. And the greater the institution, the greater the monetary system. And you have the greatest monetary systems of history associated with the greatest institutions. And then you have the weakest ones: all the way down to somebody on a 80-foot sailing ship in the middle of the Atlantic and there\u2019s a ledger and there\u2019s a quarter-master and there\u2019s 42 people and that\u2019s their money system and they\u2019re trading. It\u2019s a money system which is good for 6 weeks or 8 weeks, but it is life or death for the 8 weeks. And that is the fiat standard and that\u2019s backed by the force of the captain.

You know, to be honest, after kind of catching you on a few other spots over the last few months, you\u2019re my favorite Bitcoiner of 2020! I really like the way you speak about Bitcoin and these words you\u2019re going for \u2014 Truth, Freedom, Curiosity, Possibility \u2014 you know, maybe The Great Unseen. So I heard you speak some other spots, like particularly Nico\u2019s show BITVOLT just kind of about where you were going with your life before Bitcoin, what you were trying to do. And I heard you on the Cosmic Deep-Dive, hosted by Jon Chenot. And I was really blown away by the material that you were covering there. You know, I think we\u2019re probably about a decade apart, and I think in this conversation age is just a number \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 but I touch on that because you did these things maybe chronologically after me but I think you took a lot of the feelings and emotions I had and took them further! Or just had a lot of conviction, and I\u2019d kind of like to explore that, if you will. And what I got from that is: you were exploring, you were looking for Truth and the world didn\u2019t always seem fair to you. Or it didn\u2019t seem to speak to you. The externalities seemed a little bit darker than you wanted. So what I\u2019m getting at is: you graduate college \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you went to school \u2014 but you were like, I\u2019m gonna go into the world, I\u2019m gonna make money, I think you went into investment management, but what was really interesting to me there was that you jumped to China! And you wanted to see the future \u2014 you wanted to live it! And I\u2019m really curious to know how big of a decision that was for you? What other things you were thinking about in terms of careers or locations, really? And just some of the things you might have got from China \u2014 was it the future? I\u2019m more talking about the 10 years that you were there, I\u2019m not talking so much about where we are with China now."}

Yeah in hindsight, reflecting back on it, I\u2019ve always been anti-establishment, anti-authority, not to say that I was a troubled kid. I pretty much was able to maneuver my way by being bad enough that I could have some fun and that kind of thing, but maintaining good enough relationships with older people that I could always smooth it over. But that was always my sense, and I was always a curious kid, and I was fortunate as a youngster to have exposure to a lot of unique individuals, both through travel and through my dad\u2019s occupation and the people he came across. And so I say that only to kind of speculate where or why is it that any of us are more or less curious? That was kind of an open question \u2014 I don\u2019t have an answer to that. But as I grew up, money was something that I recognized as giving you access to the world. Increasing your optionality I guess would be the terminology we\u2019d use today in Bitcoin that you hear a lot! And I also saw the stresses that money placed on my family growing up, and I didn\u2019t want those! I wanted to be free of those! And so I was focused on making \u2014 you know, when I was younger I just wanted to be as rich as possible. But simultaneously \u2014 and totally unintentionally\u2014was just, this is the only definable moment I can really say that it really took flight for me. Because I think we\u2019re all just in the world trying to figure it out, so we all have a certain level of curiosity, of course. But I remember playing with one of the kids on the street when I was 11, 12, and she was my age but she was ahead a year in school. And I was like, What the fuck? I hate school! How are you getting out a year before me? And she was like, Well I just read a lot! And I was like, What the fuck do you mean \u2014 read a lot? That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what we do in school, does it? And she was like, Well, I dunno! School was just easier for me as a result, so they bumped me up! And so I never got bumped up in school, but I took that as \u2014 that kind of set my mind on fire and I was like, This reading thing must have something to it! [05:18] And so I went back to my dad\u2019s bookshelf that day and picked out a book, and I still remember the book it was! It was Hidden Power: Unleashing the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, which was quite an interesting book to start with! Because I\u2019d never considered even the influence of my subconscious mind till then. And so it was kind of revelatory to me, really, and it probably served as a bit more of a foundation than I\u2019ve ever given it credit to subsequent to reading it. Anyways, I started reading a lot and really enjoyed that, and read all the classic Buffett and Graham investing books when I was in high school because I thought, You know, the way to be rich is to work your money! You don\u2019t want to be a wage slave \u2014 you want to basically make money by rent-seeking of other people\u2019s money! So that\u2019s what the plan was in high school. And I did a rotary exchange after high school \u2014 I was in Japan for a year. And it was probably around that time that I realized that China was the future. I think that was 2004\u20135. I\u2019d done a lot of reading about China with all the books available at the time, and it was very clear to me that the 21st Century was gonna be China\u2019s century, as the US was the 20th Century and the UK was for the 19th Century and so on. And Shanghai was the New York, and so I thought \u2014 I actually didn\u2019t want to go to university, I wanted to actually leave high school at grade 11 and just go! \u2014 but I was corralled out of those decisions. In hindsight, unfortunate, but heigh-ho! And so after I finished university, I went down to South America and spent 3\u20134 months there. Part of that was exploring Ayahuasca and learning about that, and another part was partying a little bit too much and traveling around and backpacking and that sort of thing. And then\u2014to answer your question \u2014 there was no trepidation or it wasn\u2019t a very well thought-out thing, I just said, Shanghai is the New York of the 21st Century, that\u2019s where I wanna be! So I booked a one way ticket and I booked a few nights at a hostel and I said, I\u2019ll figure it out, you know! So I flew home from South America, switched out my bags, filled out my backpack with a few different items and booked a one way ticket to Shanghai. I mean I wanted a job in finance, I put my resume around, didn\u2019t get anything, and then I\u2019m a die-hard UFC fan, a guy on a forum said, We\u2019re watching the fights at a bar one night, I end up going to the bar, sitting next to that guy and he ends up being HR for the biggest ex-pat wealth manager at the time, and so I got an interview, got a job, and worked in that capacity for a few years. And all the while during university I had started to change my tune about the principle aim in life being wealth accumulation, and that coincided with exploring the psychedelic realms, or let\u2019s say different aspects of consciousness via certain psychedelic substances. And you know that leaves an indelible mark on you! It\u2019s really difficult to have those experiences and not be changed, and I think a current of change was already happening in me but that certainly accelerated it. And so it took a little bit of the hunger and edge and whoop-ass and take names of my intent of going to Shanghai \u2014 so when I found myself in the wealth management industry, (1) I was a bit disillusioned because I thought it would be a little bit more sincere in terms of what the role of an asset manager is, but you\u2019re a glorified salesperson and you\u2019re told to sell, sell, sell, basically. And that\u2019s the same pretty much everywhere. And so I ended up not liking the industry, not liking the job, but still wanting to be in China because you know this is where the Bitcoin narrative kind of has really impacted my life is: I hate to say this, but my initial years in China I kind of lost myself, which is weird for me to say because I\u2019ve always been someone who took care of my health and took care of my intellect and tried to learn and tried to grow and tried to continue develop myself and not be wrapped up in a lot of the things that people get wrapped up in, whether they be substance abuse or bad lifestyle habits or bad relationships or all that kind of stuff. [10:05] But my assessment of the world at the time from having consumed a ton of resources about anything I could find about every industry and how it all worked \u2014 we all try to piece together the world in our own ways and that\u2019s what I tried to do. And I wasn\u2019t left with a great impression in terms of what was in store for the world. And so once the kick-ass nature of my desire to go to China and work in Finance dissolved away, I was a little bit left with \u2014 a bit aimless is I guess the way to put it! So I probably didn\u2019t treat myself as well as I should have during that time, but I still felt that China was the place to be: I still thought it was the future and I thought there was opportunity there, and I loved the energy there. I mean Shanghai is a modern city and there\u2019s a great ex-pat population and the young local people are awesome. It\u2019s a really great place to live, if you can handle the pollution. I stayed there and I ended up going back to school for 3 years and I studied natural medicine and then I worked in that capacity in Shanghai also. But I guess it was in 2014 I came across Bitcoin, or finally got in. And then in 2015 I interviewed Bobby Lee who at the time was the head of BTCC which was one of the longest-running Bitcoin exchanges in the world and he was kind of a \u201ccentral figure\u201d or \u201cpopular figure\u201d in the mix of Bitcoin. And that really started turning my perspective around, because\u2014as is so often the case these days when you hear anyone talk about Bitcoin, and I think Saylor has done a great job amplifying that message \u2014 is: Bitcoin is hope! Bitcoin represents so much hope for the future, because it remedies so many of the fundamental issues that plague society and culture and markets and economies today. And that started to dawn on me. And like I think is the case for everybody, you go down the rabbit hole and you say, This is interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Wow! This is really interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Holy shit! And then you go a little further and you find yourself obsessed and not able to really think or do anything else beyond the obligations that you have! And that\u2019s kind of what happened with me. And so I left China in mid-2018, I went down to Thailand and ended up meeting someone there and we just basically have stayed there for over a year. And I find myself stuck in Canada at the moment with the COVID nonsense that\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the closed-notes version of the story. But I think the more relevant point, because that may have been boring to some, what Bitcoin has done for me is \u2014 I mean it dramatically reorients many things in your perspective \u2014 but I kind of thought that like it was a fait accompli that China was gonna take over the world, and it probably still is even if everyone\u2019s on a fair playing field. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Bitcoin standard everywhere, I think that\u2019s probably still going to be the case! But because of Bitcoin, it\u2019s kind of reinvigorated everywhere else in the world, and Bitcoin is everywhere, right? And so I can get my rocks off about being at the vanguard of a momentous shift, and one that\u2014far more the case in Bitcoin than in China \u2014 is representative of an extremely positive change, I can be involved in that anywhere. And so part of the reason why I was in Shanghai was I just didn\u2019t want to miss out on it! I thought this was like a massive historical shift and I kind of wanted to be at the center of it! I wanted to be in New York at the turn of the 20th Century, or early 1900s, right? And now I don\u2019t so much feel that pull, because I think the big story\u2014the macro narrative of our time \u2014 is definitely Bitcoin now. And Bitcoin is such that you can be involved in it anywhere! So now it\u2019s sort of re-framed in my mind that the most important thing, and the thing that I most focus on, is maximizing sovereignty and freedom. How can I construct my life so that I have the highest degree of optionality and freedom to live the life I want to with my friends and family and loved ones and all that kind of stuff, and that\u2019s the big story that I think is unfolding for a lot of Bitcoiners right now."}

There\u2019s lots to unpack there that I want to get into. One of the things you said, I think in the Cosmic Deep Dive, is before Bitcoin, the external world caused you to withdraw, and that there were bright and dark spots then. And I really related to that in the sense that I think in my 20s I really wanted to find Truth and Fairness and Freedom, but I think a lot about this fair side of it, where I didn\u2019t think the world was fair, I didn\u2019t like a lot of what I was encountering in the external world, and I did withdraw! And I really waffled between whether I\u2019m an introvert who built up extroverted skills, or I\u2019m an extrovert who just reverted from the world and didn\u2019t want to deal with a lot that was coming my way. I didn\u2019t feel that I could get ahead fairly. Like you were saying, it seemed that the best way to get ahead was rent-seeking! I remember in college I studied Finance, I learned all the tricks, I learned how really big players made a lot of money. None of it seemed fair to me. I think that was one of the reasons I dreamed \u2014 you know growing up I watched things like Family Ties. I wanted to be an investment banker like Alex P. Keaton and by the time I got there I was like, I don\u2019t want to spend my life doing that! Sucking \u2014 you know, being a parasite! Because I don\u2019t think that \u2014 I recognized that, while the intellectual capacity of the globe was going to Finance, that\u2019s not really what was creating value for the world. You were just moving around digits and monetizing transactions. And so in my 20s I think it made me really think about exploring myself, and I think that was one of the reasons I fell into things like \u201cpartying\u201d or making that kind of lifestyle, where you\u2019re looking to be with your friends, you\u2019re living for today. And it wasn\u2019t until \u2014 I think without Bitcoin I had a lot of despair! The world just seemed dark, and it didn\u2019t seem like a place you could get ahead unless you worked more than other people at some hamster wheel someone else created, or was a rent-seeker. And that was just not fun! And you just looked for fun elsewhere, and you lived for today, I think. One of the things you said that really stuck with me is that at 11 years old you discovered reading, and you went to your father\u2019s bookshelf and you picked off \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of that book but it has a fascinating title for an 11 year old or any age. So I\u2019m wondering, Did your parents encourage reading? And what I\u2019m getting at there is: Did they encourage curiosity and truth-seeking?"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-bitcoin-matrix/john-vallis-bullish-on-zFIJm4RElyV/", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [17:43]: Yeah. I can\u2019t remember \u2014 I think it was 11, 12, 13, somewhere around there. But that was definitely the book. No! They didn\u2019t! There was no encouragement of that type whatsoever. You know, my parents \u2014 I think this is a positive thing: they\u2019ve always been very supportive, which, all you can really ask out of parents is love and support. I mean, because who the fuck knows how to bring another human being into the world, right? What are the best ways to treat a fresh mind and mold it and form it into someone who\u2019s fit to go out into this crazy world and succeed and be happy? Who the fuck knows how to do that? So I think you gotta default into just saying, Did they love you and did they support you in the best way that they could? And in my case the answer was definitely, Yes! But there wasn\u2019t much specific direction of that kind. They weren\u2019t like, Hey man, you gotta read in order to be smart and successful in the future. They just wanted me to go to school, behave, do well at school, and come home and not cause too much trouble! And that\u2019s what I did, but I think maybe why that worked for me is because it just gave me the space to explore on my own and to say like, Nobody is pushing me in one direction or another\u2014I get to choose! And I chose to \u2014 like I said before \u2014 I think I benefited from having certain people in my life as a result of both my family and my dad\u2019s occupation, who in hindsight, I can look back now and say that they were very unique people. And I think for the right type of mind, which was mine, who would be curious about unusual people, I think that fed the flames of my curiosity to say like, Why are those people like that? And what makes them tick? You know, just getting different personalities and looks and types of people \u2014 exposure to them when you\u2019re younger I think is beneficial because you kind of see that its not a cookie-cutter approach to \u201chow people are\u201d. People can be a lot of different ways! And there\u2019s a lot of different positive attributes and negative attributes that people have. And to see that spectrum when you\u2019re young and to perhaps naturally gravitate towards one end of it, like the more curious, unconventional, anti-authoritarian \u2014 however you want to characterize it \u2014 I think that that was an initial push in that direction, and then my own curiosity just took over and it led to this life!"}

I remember when I was really young, I was probably at 7 or 8, both my parents were public school teachers. And I turned to my dad and I turned to my pop and I said, I want to be a teacher like you! And he kind of grabbed me by the elbow and was like, I worked too hard! Don\u2019t ever become a teacher! And he wasn\u2019t telling me don\u2019t become an educator.

I mean, they busted their ass and I\u2019m really happy with everything they\u2019ve given me, but it was very striking to me that \u2014 it was a little bit of a lesson of, Take care of yourself, it felt like!

So it\u2019s almost like the nominal amount of money probably wasn\u2019t the issue. It may very well have been their relationship to money and to wealth and to their spending, and so whatever it was, it was definitely something that was very very seared into my mind, like I don\u2019t want to have that kind of stress in my life. Like I can tell that that kind of stress is unhealthy. That type of stress\u2014it just isn\u2019t good and I didn\u2019t want it. So I think that kind of fostered that desire to really go after money, but as a said, you can\u2019t help what you really believe. And this is something that you only learn maybe when you get older, or for most people. But you can\u2019t fool you. You can fool everybody else for a time, but you can\u2019t fool you. And that\u2019s the tricky part, and that\u2019s the part that requires courage when you come to that \u2014 a lot of people have difficult times in their life, and maybe it\u2019s a crisis moment or maybe it\u2019s just an accumulation of experience where you say like, I gotta just step up and do what feels right and true to me. Not to anybody else, not for any other reason than, This is actually who I currently am, and this is the journey that I\u2019m on, and the place in that journey that I\u2019m at. And you know, that\u2019s difficult! And one of the things that gets me so excited about Bitcoin is that a big impediment to people being actually able to do that is the financial concern, right? Like I have to be Lawyer John because every day I go and be Lawyer John \u2014 if I\u2019m anything other than Lawyer John I can\u2019t put food on the table, I can\u2019t pay my bills, I can\u2019t support my family, whatever it is. But Bitcoin is providing a very very very unique opportunity I think for people to put themselves in a situation where the financial concerns are becoming less and less and ultimately, hopefully, no impediment to them expressing who they truly are! I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s super easy. I mean a big part of my development and all the traveling and escapades that I went on was trying to figure out and refine what exactly that was. And trying to explore. We talk about looking out on the world and being a bit concerned with how it looked and not very motivated to pushing to the future \u2014 that despair that you mentioned. And you know, a big part of my searching \u2014 traveling and trying different experiences and stuff \u2014 was kind of me saying, Surely there\u2019s more than this! Like once you put together a piece of the world and you see maybe it doesn\u2019t look so good to you, you come away with like, Surely there\u2019s more! And I kept just following that impulse and I refused to believe that there was no answer to that question. [25:25] I maintained the belief that surely there was! Again I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to do but I think a lot of people who are set free financially by being involved in Bitcoin now and into the future, I think the degree of sovereignty that permits is going to allow them to have the choice to actually become or be or express who they genuinely are, and I think that\u2019s of huge benefit to the world and of course it\u2019s of massive benefit to the individual, because there\u2019s nothing worse than having to act in a manner that is not genuine. Having to be someone who you\u2019re not. And that characterizes probably most people in the world today, and I\u2019m really excited for more and more people being able to step out of that fa\u00e7ade and start to explore and express who they really are!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-bitcoin-matrix/john-vallis-bullish-on-zFIJm4RElyV/", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "Cedric Youngelman [26:20]: Yeah. I can relate to a lot of that! I wonder how much watching our parents \u2014 like my parents were hardworking people. My father even had a second job working at flea markets and kind of just trying to provide more. I don\u2019t know how much what we saw was their relationship to money as to inflation. Because they were doing what they were supposed to do and it was still a struggle to do and accomplish all the things that we wanted or needed. And I use wanted and needed interchangeably there but I know the difference. But it\u2019s interesting you told a particularly interesting anecdote on the Cosmic Deep Dive about \u2014 and I think it relates to what you were talking about with genuineness \u2014 where you came home and you were out drinking with your friends, and instead of telling your parents you were having having snacks with Johnny and Tommy, you were like, This is what I did, I\u2019m a little tired right now, and we can deal with this later. And in that reference point what struck me was you were like, I\u2019m about truth, and if I lie to this important people, all I\u2019m doing is forking reality. And I thought that was a really interesting concept. I also wonder how much \u2014 have you always been a wanderer and are you still a wanderer? Or do you think you were searching for something and you might have found it? I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but do you still feel that wandering spirit?"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-bitcoin-matrix/john-vallis-bullish-on-zFIJm4RElyV/", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [27:46]: Right. So that story is true, and you said it perfectly! I can\u2019t remember how I articulated it at the Cosmic Deep Dive, but I\u2019ve always felt that way. I always had a reverence for truth, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little bit more complex, but the most simplest way that it manifested in my mind was, If I don\u2019t tell the truth, then I\u2019ve created a false reality. Right? Both for myself and the person whom I\u2019m lying to. And I\u2019ve always had such a burning curiosity and desire to understand reality. I mean this is what all this searching is about, and this is what going into the jungle and spending time with psychedelic brews and that kind of stuff is all about. It\u2019s like trying to figure out what is really going on here! And it was repugnant to me to be complicit in the creation of illusion, and to fostering more false reality than I already perceived there was \u2014 even at that young age! So that\u2019s why I always did my best to tell the truth, even if it landed me in the hot water sometimes. Now in that particular case it wasn\u2019t that hard because I was already caught red-handed. [28:58] Like, I might as well own up to it because I wasn\u2019t getting out of it! But that has always been definitely something that \u2014 not necessarily intentionally \u2014 I just always felt really uncomfortable to do anything but [tell the truth]. And to the second part: definitely a lot of wandering, for that very reason! But Bitcoin has grounded me, in a way. It\u2019s also caused a lot of my previous interests and education and knowledge acquisition or whatever you want to call all of that, to converge on something that seems to be able to house all of those interests and all of that knowledge, and really give it a gravity and really make it relevant. So in a way I think the wandering has maybe been exacerbated, but it\u2019s been far more focused, right? Like I don\u2019t have to tell you the Bitcoin rabbit hole is very deep and so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m consuming less information these days and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m contemplating what I know and trying to recognize patterns any less. If anything I think it\u2019s more, because Bitcoin kind of forces you to do that, but it\u2019s grounding in that I\u2019m no longer searching for the thing, you know? My universe of really meaningful things \u2014 I\u2019m happy where that is right now! I think Bitcoin is \u2014 well not that it was ever going to be, because it didn\u2019t exist at the beginning of this journey \u2014 but to me it represents a tool that can dissolve a lot of that despair that I previously felt, away. It can restructure and reorient both individuals and as a result of that, the structures and institutions that we see in society. And then once you begin to explore that relationship a bit more, you start to be not just relieved but excited, because you understand the relationship between the money and the individual and the culture. And that I think makes us all excited, and this term \u201cThe Bitcoin Renaissance\u201d that we all often use I think comes from a recognition that this can be the foundation for something amazing, incredible, extraordinary! And so why not feed into that? Why not give that your energy? Your intellectual energy, your financial energy, whatever. Like, how could you not, basically is where I\u2019m at! And I love that, because in my search for meaning before, the psychedelic realms were probably it, right? Taking care of your body and being healthy and all that kind of stuff, but the apex was just the mystery of the psychedelic state of consciousness. Like, what is that? And even though we can\u2019t answer that question, you could tell that it was extremely personal, extremely beneficial experience, and that\u2019s kind of why I kept going back to that well. But, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s imbalanced if you only derive meaning \u2014 not to say only derive meaning from that realm, but to hold that realm or that experience up as like the apex \u2014 I think it leaves a lot to be desired in meat space, in the physical world. Because you can have this Godlike experience, but you come back down and the world still looks the same, like it doesn\u2019t change anything, and so my greatest hope prior to Bitcoin was that I always believed the world could change in an instant! Because all that needs to happen is that people need to change their minds, and then we\u2019d have a different world. But practically speaking, well that\u2019s not very practical! I mean how do you get 8 Billion people just to change their minds on a dime? And it seemed like the forces at work at society, like yes there were bright spots and maybe even their brightness was growing, but there are also big dark spots and that seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle. And Bitcoin has come around and embodied a lot of those principles actually that are represented in the psychedelic realm as well. Of: individual responsibility and individual sovereignty and control over your own domain, and represented that in the \u201cphysical realm\u201d to actually be a tool to foster a lot of those things. To take individuals who are like-minded \u2014 and I kind of hate this term but let\u2019s say awakened individuals \u2014 people that are kind of waking up from the malaise of the cultural conditioning that so many people are subjected to from the time they\u2019re born, and saying, Something\u2019s off here! How can we make it better? I think Bitcoin represents such a great tool to foster that! And so you put those two things together and I feel like we\u2019re kind of attacking it from both sides, and simultaneously, because of course neither one is restricted to one domain, but of course what I love about Bitcoin and what I love exploring with people that I talk to, is how Bitcoin is changing people! [34:31] And not just their financial circumstances and not just how much optionality they have to move around and that kind of stuff, but like, Why is it affecting what you eat and how you treat your body and who you spend time with? And your aspirations for your family in the future? And the amount of time you spend in nature? And I don\u2019t want to cast too wide a net here and I know everyone has a different experience, but those are very common things that crop up, and I think you could put them all under the category of: People are trying to better themselves in more ways than just their bank account. And so there\u2019s a lot of overlap there with people that were on the psychedelic pursuit and exploring those realms. I just think it\u2019s awesome! So I find that they balance each other well, so to answer your question a little bit more succinctly, I think I have stopped wandering a lot! I\u2019d love to find a place that valued freedom and sovereignty that was settled already \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re there yet \u2014 but I think hopefully in our lifetimes that\u2019ll become clear. And really put down some roots. But otherwise, I can\u2019t imagine being involved in anything more exciting right now, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna be here for a while."}

It\u2019s really interesting that you bring up the psychedelic realm and some of the truths or things that that unlocks. I think before Bitcoin I felt that things were fake, the world was fake, I was struggling with that. Was it a huge leap of faith with you to be honest with people about your psychedelic explorations? And I\u2019m getting at that more maybe with family but also career-wise? Did you feel that you were putting your career off? At that young age you want to create wealth, you want to seize opportunities, and you also want to \u2014 regardless of how you feel about the external world \u2014 you kind of have to put out your resume and talk about things.

And this may go back to the, Tell my mom if I could just go to bed and we can deal with this in the morning. To me the trade-off of not expressing how I truly felt about something was never worth it. And that\u2019s probably held me back at least financially in my career or in different domains. I can\u2019t give you a specific reason why, but I\u2019ve never catered to that end. Right? So I think a lot of people cater to the end of climbing the corporate ladder or getting more money or whatever. I always \u2014 the highest priority was that nobody felt that I wasn\u2019t telling them how I really felt about something, that I wasn\u2019t telling the truth. And not even for the other person \u2014 that\u2019s always been for me! I couldn\u2019t put up with being afraid to say something that I actually felt was valuable or that I believed in! The most common place I\u2019ve bumped up against this was with my parents, because I always felt like I was never crazy. I always felt like I could logically justify and articulate why it is I was pursuing what I was pursuing. And even if those things were unconventional from a mainstream perspective, I still felt like I could justify them. And if you wanted to challenge me on them I\u2019d be more than happy to entertain it. But I think my parents and friends and stuff like that figured out early on that you better have your shit together if you\u2019re gonna challenge me on certain things, the things that I\u2019ve chosen to be vocal about or engaged in. Because I don\u2019t do things willy-nilly! Like, I didn\u2019t just go down to \u2014 to use an obvious example \u2014 like my mom was terrified when I told her at 20 or 21 that I was gonna go down to the rainforest for 3\u20134 months and take the most powerful psychedelic known to man and live in a hut with a shaman. Like, you know, for some moms that\u2019s a bit worrying!"}

I really want to touch on what you said about, Bitcoin is a tool. And when you put it that way it almost demystifies it for me in some regards. When I first heard that, it was sort of mystifying. But now it\u2019s demystifying \u2014 it\u2019s just a tool! You know, you can take a hammer, you could build or you could destroy. And when you put it in that framework, do you think Bitcoin is revelatory, or it\u2019s just something that we found in nature and we wanted it and now it\u2019s here? At some point when Bitcoin is just money, the conversations that we\u2019ve been having around money dwindle a bit. You\u2019ve still gotta educate people about money, saving for their future and stuff, but it\u2019s not so big a deal anymore! It\u2019s just the thing we use! And so in that regard, do you think Bitcoin is a revelation, or just something that we\u2019ve been waiting for and now it\u2019s here?"}

I would say that first on a very basic level, we won\u2019t be talking about Bitcoin in 50\u2013100 years. Because it\u2019ll be so fundamental and foundational to the culture and society at that time that it\u2019s not novel anymore. People don\u2019t really talk about the Internet broadly anymore as they did maybe in the early 90\u2019s. Any tool, I guess we value any tool, maybe even revere tools, dependent upon what they permit! What are the possibilities that the tool represents? And to that degree we revere them. And I think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people that think about this deeply are starting to realize that this tool \u2014 like everything, all technology\u2019s a tool \u2014 everything outside of our physical bodies that we want to use to take action in the world is a tool, right? And I just think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people are starting to understand what this tool represents for possibility now and into the future. What kind of novel possibilities for action does this tool represent? And I think that\u2019s why the rabbit hole is so deep, and that\u2019s why understanding money is so deep, because when you understand what we use money for and how it\u2019s evolved in the history of money and that kind of stuff, and its implications and the relationship that individuals have with it and how it fosters the culture and the society that gets built on top of it. I think what we\u2019re realizing is that this tool represents a dramatically positive shift in how we relate to one another economically and then of course as a collective where things grow on top of that. So on that level maybe it\u2019s just a tool, but everything speaks to us as more than just what it is. There\u2019s an affect to everything. You may just say value is subjective, so this acorn here that\u2019s on my table now, it\u2019s kind of worthless to me, it\u2019s nothing. But to other people they might really like it, so what\u2019s going on there when people really value something, like what it \u201cmeans\u201d to them is a pretty tricky and deep question, but I think what Bitcoin\u2019s gonna end up doing is allowing us to explore further ourselves about what the potential for human action and human coordination and cooperation is, and what can result from new and novel methods of interacting. And that may sound boring or mechanical, but I don\u2019t think it is. I mean I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about, right? We\u2019ve been talking about exploring our own consciousness, exploring the world, trying to tease out who and what we are and what we want to do with this opportunity that we have as being human beings on Earth, and a tool like this dramatically expands those things on many different levels and domains, and that is a deeply deeply meaningful thing and I think that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s being treated with such reverence by the hardcores right now."}

And something else you said earlier on one of those podcasts was that Bitcoin self-selects. And I\u2019m kind of curious how maybe Bitcoin changed your behavior, because I find that you were \u2014 like my parents and maybe myself \u2014 Bitcoiners before Bitcoin! Like, trying to find that fair world. Trying to match your internal with your externalities. Trying to find that stasis or that peaceful dynamic. So I\u2019m kind of curious how that changed your behavior. And you said something very early on in the show that you interviewed Bobby Lee. And I remember Bobby Lee as a heightened character in the earlier Bitcoin days, so that was a get! That was someone important to talk to at that time. He was prominent. But up until that point where you were talking, interviewing wasn\u2019t a part of your job-set per se. You were working, you came across Bitcoin, but now all of a sudden you were interviewing someone! I\u2019m kind of curious a little bit about that moment and how you came to change from just learning about Bitcoin to actually interviewing someone and thinking that that was something that \u2014 I don\u2019t know why you thought that would bring you benefit \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t! I interview people, it brings me tremendous benefit. But how you came to that notion that you should, could, would interview someone, and how it just changed your behavior personally?"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-bitcoin-matrix/john-vallis-bullish-on-zFIJm4RElyV/", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [46:13]: Yeah so to attack the first one, you\u2019re right! The cliche changes that get bandied around as what Bitcoiners do when they fall down the rabbit hole, many of them had already been integrated I guess into my character and into my life, but you cannot discount the impact and the power of hope. And not even just hope, like I was saying before, like not only that the future doesn\u2019t look so dark anymore, but that it looks really really really bright and exciting \u2014 I think part of the reason it inspires change is because like if you don\u2019t have something drawing you forward, then the relevance of novel information that you encounter on a daily basis and even the radar you have up for your sensitivity to acquiring useful knowledge, is dramatically diminished! Because if you don\u2019t see a reason to refine yourself now in order to function better in the future, there\u2019s nothing pulling you forward, then you\u2019re gonna be kind of numb, your sensitivity is gonna be much less to all the things that you could pick up in your environment that could make you more fit for the future. And I think this was part of the reason why so many people today treat their bodies and their minds really poorly! They consume junk television and Netflix and binge-watch all this stuff, several hours a day they stuff their face full of shitty foods, their consciousness is not sensitive to all the different cues and pieces of information and knowledge in their environment that might go toward making them more fit for the future. And so obviously time preference plays into this, but I just think, when you don\u2019t see much on the horizon, there\u2019s no real natural impulse to make yourself more fit to take advantage of it. And if you see really not-good stuff on the horizon, you\u2019re far more incentivized to kind of ignore the noise of information that you might use, and just get your rocks off now! Just go for sensual pleasure! But if you see hope on the horizon, then it shines a spotlight back, and especially the more you learn about the relationship of money to the structure of society, and when you go down that Bitcoin rabbit hole, you see the potential for what it could create in the future, well then the spotlight comes back on you and says, Are you as ready as you could be to take advantage of that? Because that shit\u2019s gonna be awesome! Are you ready? Like, are you taking care of yourself enough? Are you cultivating yourself physically, intellectually, spiritually, all these different ways in order to maximize the benefit of that thing that you now see on the horizon? And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why a lot of Bitcoiners are inspired to change in the ways that they have, and I think we\u2019re just at the beginning of this thing, man! This wasn\u2019t really a big part of the narrative like 3\u20134 years ago. I would say that this whole Bitcoin changes you thing, at least as it\u2019s talked about today, is like 2 years old! Maybe a little bit longer. But it\u2019s really amazing how quickly it can take effect, and that\u2019s why I like to joke what we\u2019re all gonna be like at the next halving \u2014 that\u2019s more than 3 years away! Like, what are we gonna look like then, when people are reporting \u2014 you know I\u2019ve talked to people that got in on March of 2020 and 6 months later they\u2019re telling me all the different dramatic ways they changed their life in 6 months! I mean what happens when it\u2019s a year, 2 years, 4 years? So I think that\u2019s one of the powerful impacts of hope, is that it actually sensitizes you to interact with your environment as though it had greater meaning, because it now held greater purpose and prospects for a better future, whereas before it didn\u2019t. So I feel like that\u2019s one of the ways that it really tunes you to just act differently and treat your environment differently. [50:46] What was the second part of that question?"}

But you know, I want to say my parents were Bitcoiners before Bitcoin: They lived for the future. They always sacrificed today for tomorrow, and they sacrificed themselves for their children. I don\u2019t know what their lives were like before us. But I had despair and I think that\u2019s why in my 20\u2019s I was just seeking pleasure. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not saying I was all about pleasure in the physical world\u2014 but I was living for today. And just trying to enhance myself. Like yourself I spent 5 years actually at one of the Big Four accounting firms, and then I left to go on a 3-month journey through the South-Pacific by myself. Really just to chisel out myself and you know there\u2019s nothing like \u2014 when you\u2019re a tourist and you\u2019re with people you might go see the Grand Canyon but it\u2019s like, What do you think? I don\u2019t know! What do you think?\u2014When you\u2019re by yourself it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have to be here if I don\u2019t want to be here. Why am I here? Why am I doing whatever I\u2019m doing? Before Bitcoin the external world caused you to withdraw and it would bring dark spots. But one of the things is it\u2019s like, Now the future is brighter! And you did touch on this thing: In the Western World we have a crisis of diseases of despair. And a lot of times when you hear news or narratives, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 well it\u2019s always someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 but some opinions you hold a little bit more closely or value. So when you said something to that effect, it really struck a chord because I see the despair, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s greater than before! So in my 20\u2019s I\u2019m wandering but in my 30\u2019s I happened to get married, I fell in love, I found my wife, my soul-mate, and I had children. And I kind of had to give the wandering up for them, and give my own despair up for them, and just get it done and not bring it home, and figure out a way to get ahead. And it was a constant scramble, because you\u2019re doing the job, you\u2019re trying to figure it out, and things are always running away from you. But I had to just buckle down and figure it out! There\u2019s no excuses, right? But when I found Bitcoin, things got a lot brighter, because I had \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna say a way out \u2014 but I had control over my own money in the sense that no one could debase it. Not control like censorability or seizability or any of those things, but like, No one\u2019s gonna eff with my money! And that really changed my whole outlook. So I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on this crisis of despair for people who haven\u2019t found Bitcoin? And when I say that I don\u2019t want to make it sound like Bitcoin is their salvation, as much as it can be for us \u2014 again I think the salvation comes from within, and we were looking for Bitcoin, that\u2019s why we found it. You said it before: Bitcoin self-selects! Ideas have people, we had that idea in our head for some reason that we needed to find a better way. But what do you make of the despair around the globe and how real or actual or heavy that is?"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-bitcoin-matrix/john-vallis-bullish-on-zFIJm4RElyV/", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [54:17]: Yeah as you said, it\u2019s difficult to compare something like that because most people lead lives of quiet desperation and as a result it\u2019s not broadcast, it\u2019s not a statistic, so it\u2019s difficult to compare that across time scales. But I think most people if they\u2019re empathetic enough, if they\u2019re sensitive enough, they\u2019re paying attention enough, they can see that there\u2019s a lot of [despair] in the world today. And it\u2019s covered over in myriad ways and like what I was saying earlier, people don\u2019t act like how they truly feel! They act like how people expect them to, and how they need to act to advance their position whether that be familial, corporate, whatever! Whatever games they\u2019re in, they\u2019re acting in the manner that will advance their position in those games. And on that note you could say that fiat currency is creating a perverse meta-game and it\u2019s creating all these avatars of people that are not acting in accord with who they truly are, but in accord with what the game requires of them. And I think the last year has been really revealing of this. But I try to be empathetic, and I think at a core level we\u2019re all the same, and I think we\u2019re born in different locations to different families in different languages and all that kind of stuff, and as a result we appear different, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything really that separates us on a fundamental level. But people seem to be very confused, I guess is the nicest way to say it! And consumed by fear and not taking it upon themselves to construct their own worldview, but having one imposed on them, and they\u2019re complicit in it, of course. You don\u2019t have to go that way! But most people do, and they end up being a shadow of themselves, and they end up being avatars of this extremely perverse system that we have. And look, I don\u2019t want to be exclusively critical of this. Like, obviously there are bright moments: We could readily admit that people are conditioned by the mainstream media and the nation state and the fiat currency regime, but when you have a nice moment that [it\u2019s] your kids birthday, or when you have a beautiful moment with a loved one, or when a family member \u2014 you know like there are pockets of pure, genuine joy and experience all over at all times \u2014 and to me that\u2019s real. There\u2019s nothing intermediating that experience when it happens for real. But that\u2019s the exception. Most of the time people kind of withdraw into the conditioned, culturally determined behavior that people have come to believe is the most effective way of maneuvering themselves in this world. And I can\u2019t remember who said this quote but I remember as a youngster it always \u2014 I said it to myself often, actually, as a way to console myself for being frustrated and also curious why the world seemed so weird to me\u2014It\u2019s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society. I want to say it was Krishnamurti but I don\u2019t think it was him."}

But I can\u2019t be sure about that. Anyway, that was a bit of a mantra for me for a time, because I was seeing a lot of what I thought was irrational, crazy behavior around me and wondering why I didn\u2019t feel compelled to mimic it or to engage in the same type of behavior. And my assessment was: The society is quite sick! And I didn\u2019t at the time know that the huge reason for that was the money, I just knew that that was the case, and mainstream media and government and all the rest \u2014 I knew those were all influences. And so that quote and that way of thinking helped me maintain my steadfastness perhaps in not acquiescing and going into that. But to circle back to your question, I think there\u2019s a ton of [despair]. I think the system as it\u2019s structured right now and the siphoning off of wealth surreptitiously from people and also the macro structure of society and culture as a result of being predicated on this unfair monetary system that dominates globally, it\u2019s definitely exacerbating the propensity to fall into despair. [59:43] And all the different downstream effects \u2014 the mental health issues and the substance abuse and the anger and the frustration, and all of these things that are toxic to the individual and to relationships and to society. Obviously they\u2019re all latent within us, but I think it exacerbates them tremendously. And so I think if we wound up on a different monetary standard \u2014 one that could not be corrupted, like Bitcoin, one that was fair for everybody \u2014I think we\u2019d see a lot less of that. And in fact, when I was working in natural health, mind-body medicine or psychophysiology was something I was very interested in, and I\u2019ve said this a bunch only half-jokingly and I actually don\u2019t consider it a joke at all anymore, but I think for a therapist, someone in a therapeutic setting where they\u2019re dealing with these issues all the time now, I think it\u2019s critical that you include education about Bitcoin into the therapeutic stack, because understanding \u2014 I mean a huge element of despair is looking out at your environment and feeling like it doesn\u2019t jive with you. It doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s overbearing, or there\u2019s no hope, or there\u2019s no place for you in it, you feel alienated and isolated and all this stuff, I feel like if you understood Bitcoin and what it meant for how the external world might change, that would dramatically change your perception of how well you could integrate with the external world. And I think that\u2019s a huge aspect of mental health issues! So I think it should be integrated into the protocol stack, the therapeutic stack for mental health professionals. We\u2019re a long way off of that, but I think it should! So I see a lot less despair, mental health issues, on a Bitcoin standard. I know for a fact that it\u2019s had dramatic impacts on Bitcoiners. I\u2019ve talked with Bitcoiners, and they\u2019ve said this publicly on shows I\u2019ve done with them, that were basically suicidal. I\u2019m not gonna dig into the reasons for that, but that was where they were at. And as a result of grokking Bitcoin and starting to see it, their life has completely turned around! Ended up coming out of that and starting a family and being more financially secure and having hope for the future. And this is a huge part, man, that we haven\u2019t touched on yet, but we talk about Bitcoin as a tool and what kind of affect it has and why it draws out these behaviors and what it means for the future. But one thing that is becoming a more and more clear element of this phenomenon is the people that are communicating with each other, the \u201ccommunity\u201d that\u2019s emerging, the culture that\u2019s around this thing! [1:02:44] Like I\u2019m starting to think \u2014 Number Go Up is hands down the most, what brings people in \u2014 but in a world that\u2019s increasingly divisive and tumultuous and in conflict and vicious and all of this stuff, I think more and more people are gonna be looking at this community of people that are hopeful for the future, committed to intellectual refinement, and have very strong principles and integrity and are expressing themselves genuinely and also like to have fun, like I think part of the reason why we, you and I and everybody listening to this, feel good about being in Bitcoin is definitely the natural attributes of Bitcoin and what that means for how we can conduct our life, but it\u2019s also the fact that I can jump on a call with you now and I know that we\u2019re exactly on the same wavelength! And I can do that and I have done that with hundreds of other Bitcoiners! You know, I do a lot of calls that are not broadcast, and it just amazes me that every time I jump on one it\u2019s like there\u2019s no lag \u2014 we\u2019re immediately running right out of the gate. And going back to that piece about feeling isolated \u2014 you on your journey, me on mine \u2014 we\u2019re kind of looking for meaning and being like, There\u2019s not many people that I feel like I have a connection with, I\u2019m just really not jiving with a lot of people. And then to come into this thing and be like, Holy shit! Now there\u2019s hundreds if not thousands of people that I\u2019m sure when we meet in real life we\u2019re gonna become friends really quickly, and who are thinking like I do and who are articulating themselves in a manner that I articulate myself and there\u2019s so many similarities! And that\u2019s so powerful, man! The power of community! And I think that\u2019s one of the elements of why there\u2019s so much despair, because people are increasingly cut off, but I think that\u2019s also why this phenomenon is gonna be so therapeutic for people and draw so many in, because they see this positive culture emerging from this thing and they\u2019re gonna want to be a part of it!"}

I agree with everything you said and I really recognize that power of community. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt that at all since maybe college when you\u2019re spending a lot of time with people and you\u2019re really connect very quickly. I also related a lot to what you said about [being] consumed with fear, and like I said I made a commitment: I have a family\u2014I was gonna get through this thing no matter what! Not through this thing, I am gonna get through this thing no matter what, and I\u2019m gonna do everything I can for them. But before Bitcoin I can relate to that lack of control, and you\u2019re doing everything you can but there are certain elements \u2014 there\u2019s this tool, the money\u2019s the tool \u2014 the denominator is out of control. But before we turn to the really fun stuff that I want to get into with you, I\u2019d love to ask you a little bit about China in the 21st Century \u2014 what you\u2019ve gleaned? You haven\u2019t been there \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been \u2014 but you left living there in 2018 so it\u2019s about 2\u20133 years, but you still seem to have a lot of conviction about where they\u2019re pivoting going forward regardless of what Bitcoin does! And so I\u2019m just kind of curious a little bit about what you saw in China and why you had this conviction of them being the leader of the 21st Century? I\u2019m not even getting into whether that\u2019s good or bad! Just what is it about that that steers you in that direction, that foresight?"}

So any conversation of China is tainted with the bad things, the evil stuff the government gets up to, right? Obviously I\u2019m no defender of what they do, but when I first tried to understand the world, one question that comes to anybody who looks at this is like, Why is the US \u2014 like in our lifetimes the US has been the dominant global power \u2014 why? That\u2019s a pretty obvious question lurking out there. I remember \u2014 I think it was in high school, maybe it was a little bit after \u2014 but Jared Diamond wrote two books: Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. And he was basically trying to illustrate or explore why the world ended up looking the way it looked. Why does Europe have all the countries that it has? Why is America there and Canada there? And the sovereign individual is probably an extension of that in the 20th and 21th Century, but it basically looks at what are the factors, the technologies, the demographic factors, the geographic factors that lead to the world looking like the way it looks like. And obviously the way the world looks is in constant flux, even though right now it seems pretty set, but I mean if you look at a map of let\u2019s say the geographic boundaries of Europe over the last 1,000 years I mean it\u2019s nothing but fragmentation and consolidation and fragmentation and consolidation and change! Like, that\u2019s just what we do! So why are we at where we\u2019re at right now? And that in addition to China \u2014 I love ancient history, and of course it\u2019s instrumental if you want to understand how the world and humanity has developed. So Ancient Egypt and Ancient Sumeria and the Indus Valley civilizations and Ancient China have always been super interesting to me, and so China\u2019s always had an extremely rich and extremely ancient culture, and a highly developed one! And they were kind of isolated from the world for a large part of their history, but as far as they were concerned, they were top dog for most of their history. They had the most highly advanced civilization that they knew of, and you could make the case that it was! Ancient Chinese history and Chinese culture pre-20th Century is extremely rich and fascinating. So I just looked at it and said, Look, 1.3 Billion people, the geography and the natural resources to support it. They had a difficult time in the 20th Century, a lot of tumult and changes, but things were coalescing into a more organized and efficient state now. And I remember when I first went there, everyone was like, Ah, they\u2019ll never do anything but copy American or European goods \u2014 they\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019re a different breed! I\u2019m like, What are you talking about? We\u2019re all just people responding to our environment! There\u2019s no difference between a Chinese person, an American person, an African person, in what they\u2019re capable of as a human being! It\u2019s all just them responding to their environment and their incentives and all that kind of stuff. So to me it was very clear that China\u2019s story was gonna continue to unfold, and with a population like that and as they became increasingly rich and with the natural resources they had and with a proud legacy of being an advanced dominant civilization in the world prior to the 20th Century, I just felt like that was gonna be the natural order of things! Ultimately I know in the current geopolitical dynamic you may say like, Yeah but the US military is like way way bigger! It\u2019s like, Yeah, well, so is the Spanish military and the Portuguese and the British and the fill in the blank, fill in the blank, fill in the blank. They have a billion more people than the US! They have a lot of space for them. They have resources in their own borders and of course they\u2019ve been going all over the world buying resources. They\u2019re extremely hungry and driven and motivated people. There are no more entrepreneurial, capitalist-minded people I\u2019ve ever come across in all my travels than Chinese people! And their structure of government is deserving of a lot of criticism especially from a freedom point of view, but one, I think a lot of Bitcoiners would be critical of the state apparatus in many jurisdictions. It\u2019s not like one\u2019s good, one\u2019s bad. It\u2019s like degrees of bad that we\u2019re talking about! [1:11:10] And as far as economic development is concerned, I\u2019m a critic of central planning and I think the best way to foster growth and innovation is as an emergent property of free markets, and perhaps their development would\u2019ve been better if they went that way \u2014 who knows \u2014 but I can\u2019t knock the fact that they\u2019ve just set the parameters of the game, and then pretty much let the natural entrepreneurial energy of the people play it, and then pour on some gasoline in different areas where they want to see more development. And I think based on that maybe there\u2019s bubbles forming, but I think the overarching story is: How could you stop that? And even if we go onto a Bitcoin standard where let\u2019s say the playing field is fair and even for all countries in the world \u2014 and now the kicker here is the US is getting a massive head start on the world presumably, at least as individuals, because Bitcoin is probably adopted more in the US than most other countries in the world! And that\u2019s awesome, because that\u2019s gonna be probably a huge determining factor in the future. I also suspect that the PBoC is actually and has been accumulating Bitcoin, but that\u2019s pure speculation. That\u2019s my own feeling about how they operate. But if the world is operating on an even playing field and people can\u2019t manipulate their currencies and it\u2019s strictly a matter of who produces the most and best things that the global market wants, I think China wins at that game ultimately! Now one of the things that may influence that that I\u2019m really excited about, because I don\u2019t like the prospect of any one massive country having a huge asymmetry of power in the world, I think the shift toward \u2014 umbrella term \u2014 the means of production shifting to a local basis, so with the advent of 3D printing and all the stuff we\u2019re seeing now: An individual can generate their own power, they can grow their own food, they can make their own tables and chairs. Like, we\u2019re not there yet but that seems to be the trend that production is coming down to the individual level! And I\u2019m sure there will be other things that people end up doing, but I\u2019m hoping that that brings the locus of power back to the individual and the efficiency gains of these massive states \u2014 these centrally controlled massive states that try to control economies \u2014 will diminish, and if that\u2019s the case, maybe that influences how the geopolitical winds blow and what changes take place. But if things kind of remain on the current trajectory, I mean I just think people, geography, level of wealth now, organization, I think it\u2019s just kind of natural that China will be dominant player in the future whether we like it or not!"}

And I\u2019m only gonna buttress that up to or contrast that to the fact that \u2014 and I didn\u2019t run the numbers on this, I\u2019m not an historical expert \u2014 but it seems like they moved to the gold standard a little slower than other nations, and that cost their civilization a lot of time, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get everything right! And I\u2019m just coming at this as an agnostic\u2014I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m just curious what you think! But do you think their locus of power comes from the history, or from the fact that they\u2019re more centralized planning? And maybe we could argue that there are other states that are just as centralized. And the notion of centralization. Or is it a combination of both? I\u2019m just curious what you think?"}

Like we just simply can\u2019t appreciate what the 20th Century was like for mainland Chinese people. Like, fill in your number: 50 Million, 100 Million, dead of starvation under Mao, right? And then the Cultural Revolution where all that stuff about the past \u2014 because they felt like the world had become modern and they had lagged behind, and so the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d was basically: Do away with history, all of that tradition, that\u2019s holding us back! We\u2019ve gotta modernize and move forward! And so they destroyed ancient monuments and they tried to basically destroy the culture so that nobody would be focusing on that, and everyone would be aligned on moving forward. And you know, under that form of communism \u2014 and that was horrible, the society at that time\u2014and when I went there in 2009 and probably today in certain pockets but increasingly rare, but when I went there in 2009 you could still see vestiges of like the abject poverty and the kind of toll it took on people\u2019s mentality, to the point that now, still, the cultural mentality of the people is like, it\u2019s a bit weird! If you\u2019re under 40 that\u2019s less and less the case, but there\u2019s still a generation of people alive today, people that are 40+ that experienced a lot of that stuff. So on the one hand they know that they had this glorious past, this rich culture, but they also know that it was basically shaken out of them! And so now the nation identity \u2014 I mean they\u2019re very nationalistic people. Obviously they propagandize and all that kind of stuff, but like, basically they think this is China reascending. And the opportunity is right there in front of \u2019em and they want to get after it both for themselves and for \u201cthe glory of the nation\u201d. And so that\u2019s how people feel! And for younger people \u2014 and to kind of answer the question about how I feel it\u2019ll shake out \u2014 regardless of central planning and government structure and Bitcoin and fiat currency and whatever, the people under 40 that I knew in China, and it was pretty consistent this way, was: I meet them and you could see it in their eyes that they\u2019re curious about the world, right? They want to learn about the world, they want to travel, they want to educate themselves, they want to dress well, they want to kick ass in their chosen field. Like they\u2019re a really well put together people that are focused on \u2014 eyes on the prize, right? They know that a better life awaits, they know the opportunity, they want to get after it! Because it\u2019s been held back from them for so long! Versus, on the Western World, obviously as a result of having had it for so long there\u2019s an element of complacency \u2014 obviously in varying degrees to different people \u2014 and I hate to be too critical of our culture, but a big portion of the culture goes to work so they can come home and watch Netflix and chill out on the sofa until it\u2019s time to go to bed. Like there\u2019s not much drive beyond doing what is necessary to get by! And in China, honestly man, like that\u2019s why cities like Shanghai and Beijing and Shenzhen have such a strong energy, because everyone is after it really hard! And that\u2019s a tough thing to beat! Like people will work their goddamn asses off! It doesn\u2019t matter what the job. Like there is just such a hustle and bustle there! And I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s gonna stop anytime soon. So I think that\u2019ll feed into the economic and geopolitical dynamic that plays out."}

It\u2019s a great insight! Before we turn to your awesome article, After An Unforgettable Year, I\u2019m Most Bullish on Bitcoiners, I really want to bring up another article that you\u2019ve published on Twitter, it was just a great post. This was on December 16th: Just fuck me already, Bitcoin! John, this broke me! I didn\u2019t see it on December 16th, I was researching you, I went down your timeline, this just absolutely floored me. I think this took absolute balls and chutzpah to post!

And I mean you know when you\u2019re a younger man perhaps and you\u2019re doing this traveling around the world, you come across the odd lady and you know there\u2019s an element of playfulness and teasing and stuff. And you know maybe we\u2019ve all been in a situation where like the foreplay is done and you want to get on with it! And I think that Tweet in particular was obviously spoken from the female side of things if we\u2019re gonna frame it up that way. But no it was like, Bitcoin had been flirting with the all-time high like, C\u2019mon let\u2019s go! And what\u2019s funny about that Tweet is I don\u2019t think it was long after, but things really rocketed up after that one, which is why I think it became kind of a funny Tweet because it seemed like it was speaking to the gods of Bitcoiners, speaking to Satoshi or something like that!"}

So I\u2019m gonna ask you: Why are you so bullish on Bitcoiners?"}

And we shape our tools and we are shaped by our tools. So the story here is the changes in behavior, the changes in the methods and ways in which we interact with one another, and in which we interact with our future selves of course. That\u2019s the story here! That\u2019s the phenomenon! The attention gets placed on Bitcoin obviously because it\u2019s the novel tool that\u2019s emerged to let all this happen, but we are the story here, and the changes that happen in people as a result of this tool emerging and obviously importantly using this tool to maximum effect, to its maximum potential, the effects it has on individuals and the community that it creates \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the phenomenon! How could it be any other way? Bitcoin is just a nothingburger if we don\u2019t use it and engage with it to actually interact in novel ways. And so that\u2019s kind of what I was getting at with that article, and the fact that I\u2019ve just been \u2014 I guess as a result of that being true or as proof that that is true \u2014 I\u2019ve had the good fortune to interact with so many Bitcoiners through the podcast and through other means and hearing the stories of genuine transformation! And irregardless of age, sex, creed, nationality, whatever \u2014 I often come back to the example of Michael Saylor: It can\u2019t just be the fact that people are getting wealthier as a result of owning Bitcoin and the price going up, because here\u2019s a guy who was already extremely wealthy, and once he went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole like it\u2019s very apparent all over his face and his \u2014 you know? You can tell that this guy was changed by this thing! I think he was probably \u2014 we were discussing before, like \u2014 a bit of aimlessness, a bit of despair as a result of thinking, Is this it? Is this all there is, world, that you\u2019ve got for me? And then having this thing emerge and having the world expand as a result of this thing emerging, right? Our worlds have expanded dramatically as a result of this new tool! And people seem to be changing in dramatic and consistent ways as a result of the emergence of that tool. And going back to that phenomenon of our tools shaping us. And it was also going back to what I was saying about the psychedelic \u2014 you know, when I was kind of hanging my hat on the capacity for [the] psychedelic, or the change in consciousness or mindset to change the world, you know there was no real tool to foster that en masse. And with Bitcoin now I think we have one! By whatever means you come in, Number Go Up or the community or sovereignty or protecting from inflation or whatever, I think if you stay with it, like if you pay enough attention to it, it starts to change you! I mean this is the very consistent message in the community: Bitcoin changes you! [1:24:57] And I\u2019m so stoked by the type of changes that I see in people! And to a certain degree I\u2019ve seen in myself! That\u2019s how the world gets better, is people! Upgrade people\u2014upgrade the world. We always say, Fix the money, fix the world. But it really is: Upgrade people, upgrade the world, because that\u2019s all the world is. It\u2019s just us here on this rock. And I\u2019ve met so many \u2014 I can\u2019t say it enough man. I\u2019ve had very good fortune to have very good friends and relationships in my life: family and friends and stuff. I\u2019ve got a lot of love in my life. But it\u2019s definitely been the case that I\u2019ve always been a bit of a \u2014 felt somewhat isolated intellectually let\u2019s say. And now to see all these people from all over the world having kind of a simultaneous awakening, and like I was saying earlier \u2014 I mean I could just pick up the phone and talk to them like we\u2019ve known each other for 10 years \u2014 kind of like what we\u2019re doing right now, as a result of the seemingly consistent changes that this thing engenders in people, is nothing short of amazing! So both on a larger macro scale of seeing these positive changes in individuals, but also on a selfish individual scale saying like, Man, the number of people that I feel connected to now has grown exponentially, has exploded as a result of Bitcoin and my involvement in it! And I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of Bitcoiners! The connection, again back to that despair component, that\u2019s one of the things that make human beings happy, is genuine connection with other human beings! And the fact that Bitcoin is fostering that with like, a lot of other people, is amazing! And I think we\u2019re just starting to see the effects."}

And pre-graduating college my world was guaranteed in terms of I just did what I had to do and everything was paid for in terms of either loans or financial assistance from my parents. And then I was out on my own and the world was running away from me and it was a lot harder to connect to people in an unfair world where no one has time to spend on each other!

So you asked him, Peter, what would it take for you to understand and/or admit that other people know something you don\u2019t? Or understand something you don\u2019t? And he gibber-gabbered and didn\u2019t really answer that question and I appreciated the fact that you said that that doesn\u2019t really answer the question.

So I tried to ask a question that maybe got away from speaking past each other on specific terms and stuff like that. I knew he would do his typical thing and route around it. But I just kind of wanted to hear him admit, and I think he did kind of show his hand, because I said, What would it take for you to \u2014 I said something about ego and hubris and if you really want to learn we have to engage in discourse where we genuinely allow for the possibility that the person we\u2019re speaking with might understand something that we don\u2019t? I mean what is the point of the conversation if you\u2019re not gonna grant that to the person you\u2019re speaking with? And his answer was, Yeah but what is it that I don\u2019t know? And I think everyone in the audience \u2014 you know? Exactly! That exactly characterizes his entire perspective and his approach to this. I think maybe in hindsight a better question would have been simply like, Have you ever read cover-to-cover a book about Bitcoin? And I think his answer would be No. And I think it would be great to say to him like, You\u2019re speaking from a position of presumed authority on this subject and there\u2019s a certain cohort of people that actually value your opinion and are listening to you as if you are educated on the subject, and if you haven\u2019t even taken any time to educate yourself on the subject when anyone in this space will tell you that it takes a lot of self-education to really come to understand what this thing is \u2014 I mean every Bitcoin that I talk to is like, Half my day is trying to continue to try to understand and learn about this thing! And certainly when you first got into it you were probably set on fire and just consumed every resource you could get your hands on. And for you not to do that but still presume to speak from a position of authority is a profound moral failing on your part! And so if I had my time back I maybe would\u2019ve went that route, but I think at this point and for a long time, the only reason why I don\u2019t get a ton of enjoyment out of it is because I don\u2019t like that people are being misguided by his opinion, but as far as entertainment value, I kind of love that he\u2019s around! That he\u2019s just this irrational holdout that\u2019s kind of never gonna capitulate that we can kind of just use as a punching bag for fun as we march towards hyperbitcoinization. And it makes the process fun. This isn\u2019t all serious at the end of the day. No good revolution doesn\u2019t have some fun mixed into it, and this is a revolution. And us Bitcoiners gotta get our kick somewhere and I think Peter Schiff is probably one of them!"}

They\u2019re sovereign! Like when they are sovereign, you can say what you want and not be afraid of the consequences. But I\u2019m hoping that what comes from that among other things is that people will both develop better principles and values internally, and will hold people to account more to \u2014 will judge people more on their principles and values rather than just their position or their wealth or whatever. And so I do think we see that in Bitcoin Twitter where sure you can be successful, you can be rich, you can be whatever, but if you\u2019re caught being disingenuous, being dishonest, promoting something that\u2019s totally self-serving or all these things, people get called out! And I love that! I want to see more of that! And I think Bitcoin is a great tool for that as well because it kind of shines a spotlight on bullshit and I think someone like Peter Schiff \u2014 that\u2019s kind of why I asked that question \u2014 because it is a moral issue that you don\u2019t engage in conversation as though the person you\u2019re speaking to had anything from which you could learn! Right? To presume that your knowledge is complete \u2014 that\u2019s a moral failing! And I hope that as we become more sovereign, our lips become looser, but our conviction and our principles and our values become stronger, and we hold people to account more on those variables, not on the typical ones of status and wealth and that kind of stuff. And I see that that\u2019s what happens now in the very small Bitcoin Twitter community, and I\u2019m hoping that that proliferates further."}

And always getting worse! And no one was hearing it. No one was waking up to it. And to be honest I think it\u2019s gonna take a generation and a half for people to recognize and reflect on Bitcoin and change their behavior en masse. You know? I think we\u2019re a select \u2014 not a select few like we\u2019re special, I\u2019m not trying to say we\u2019re special \u2014but we\u2019re early, is what I mean. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permeating as quickly\u2014even if people make gains\u2014what this thing is, that it\u2019s this tool, that it could change their behavior, that it will change their behavior! But I do think that they will be forced to change their behavior, and that it will take a generation and a half. It will take our children and even our children will be subjected to what their parents think of for the last 5 years and the next 5 years. And I don\u2019t think everyone\u2019s coming around very quickly. Most people think of it still as Magic Internet Money, Super Mario coins, it\u2019s not real. They don\u2019t see their dollars shrinking or they get stocks and the stocks go up 20% a year and that\u2019s good enough, even though that\u2019s keeping up with inflation. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith. Again I\u2019m an eternal optimist, I think it\u2019s going to work out! I think we now have the tool to solve this problem for ourselves, but I think it\u2019s gonna take a long time for it to affect people en masse. But that being said, for me it\u2019s been eye-opening because I now feel freedom that I\u2019ve never felt before! A freedom that comes from being able to grasp something that I couldn\u2019t get in my hands before and now I have it. And no one can take it away from me metaphorically \u2014 I could lose it, I could spend it, but no one can take it from me! No one could debase it! And that\u2019s a really big deal! So now I\u2019m an eternal optimist but I\u2019m a little bit more inwardly pessimistic about everyone getting on board. But now I\u2019m very optimistic for myself \u2014 I\u2019ve got the keys in my hand! And before this I was afraid that I would never get the keys in my hand, that it would always be out of my reach and that I would always have to do someone else\u2019s bidding to get there. Now the bidding is my own."}

And I mean I think we all try to manage our expectations on this stuff so that we\u2019re not disappointed how fast we progress, but I will say that freedom is at first scary and then it\u2019s intoxicating! And that\u2019s been my experience, because freedom is the assumption of responsibility, right? So I think that at first is very scary, people are not used to that. But once you do it and you get comfortable with it, then you just want to do it everywhere. You get addicted to that sense of freedom and sovereignty. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I think once this narrative really breaks through like what\u2019s happening in the macro landscape and what Bitcoin represents, I can see scenarios where it happens way quicker than we all might expect. But I do try to remind myself that as is often said in this space, The future is here it\u2019s just not evenly distributed, but another way I look at it is: Everything is always in flux. There is no stasis. So when I try to imagine a future point in time where the Bitcoin Renaissance is well under way, I try not to look at reality in terms of where we are as a static current moment and where we will be at a static future moment. Like, it will always be underway! There will always be more things we\u2019re striving for, more things that are changing. And that\u2019s just the way it is. So when I think about, When will this happen? When will it be adopted? When will people change? Well the answer is some people \u2014 and a growing number of people \u2014 are actually having that transformation now! And that\u2019s awesome! And look at this great community that\u2019s growing up as a result of it. Other people it\u2019ll take them another 5 years and then they\u2019ll come in, another 10 years, another 50 years, you know? So we don\u2019t want everything to be the same everywhere at the same time, right? And that could never be the case anyways! And I think that\u2019s maybe an outlook that allows you to be a little bit more accepting of the ups and downs and the unexpected things that the flow of time throws at you, because you\u2019re kind of like, I\u2019m not gonna hang all of my hopes and dreams on some imagined reality coming to pass in the future. Because there\u2019s getting there anyways! I\u2019ll just be passing through that place if it even happens at all. [1:44:49] That\u2019s why speaking about values and principles and this journey that we\u2019ve both seen when we were younger of just trying to find ourselves and find meaning and understand the world, I think part of the reason we do that is because we know that there\u2019s something inside of us, and perhaps in that realm of things, that can be immutable and unchanging, right? Like, that I know who I\u2019m gonna be and the principles that are gonna guide me and the values I\u2019m gonna hold, irrespective of the circumstances that surround me! And there\u2019s something really liberating about that, because it\u2019s saying that no matter what happens in the world, no matter what happens in my environment, those things are still my anchor, those are me. And I think that\u2019s powerful and in a way that maybe I can\u2019t explain right now, but it gives you a sense of comfort maybe about the chaos of the external world, and having a North Star to guide you through all of that. And maybe that\u2019s part of the function that religion has served in the past, and maybe that\u2019s part of the reason, the motivation behind spiritual seeking and that sort of stuff, but I think that\u2019s one of the main benefits of taking the time or being on a continuous journey of self-understanding and refinement, is finding those things about yourself that you kind of know are immutable and unchanging, and using them to give you some level of comfort about the uncertainty of the future and the world around you."}

I think I have a two-part answer to that: One is, that\u2019s a question that I kind of \u2014 and maybe we all \u2014 obsess over as we go through life, that we want to have some idea of what the future holds and what the best use of our time is and what\u2019s gonna make us feel the best about life in general. And I think this has been largely a result of Bitcoin. I don\u2019t think I answered earlier when you asked me what specific behaviors have changed in me as a result of Bitcoin, but I think part of it is letting go into kind of a faith that if you can just show up as yourself with your genuine curiosity and not be afraid to speak the truth and connect with like-minded people that you think are good people and you wanna connect with \u2014 like if you do that and you have a faith to push into that, then I kind of feel like the result of that is the best you could hope for! So I could say like, Well I want to be the head of a billion-dollar media company in 20 years. But that\u2019s just arbitrary! Like, that\u2019s just giving an answer. And I\u2019m starting to realize that the best thing for me to follow internally is what gives me energy when I do it! What feels right! What aligns with my principles. What do I really enjoy doing? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m just beginning to understand how to interpret that and how to push into it. Because most of my life has been \u2014 I\u2019ve always been a bit spontaneous, but I\u2019ve tried to graft an imagined future onto my life in my past, and I think that\u2019s shifting a bit now to just saying, Look, I have a certain degree of freedom. I\u2019m really interested in certain things. I just wanna be myself and see what happens, basically! But a bit more of a detailed answer is: I love spending time with people \u2014 well I\u2019ll paint you my ideal scenario, and that\u2019ll probably \u2014 a picture says a thousand words. But at some point in the future, I\u2019d love to be in a natural environment, whether it\u2019s rural Canada, rural Mexico, rural Thailand, wherever, just a beautiful environment \u2014 mountains, beaches, lakes, rivers, that kind of thing \u2014 and have a place that\u2019s set up first of all for the things that I love to do. So I love to train Muay Thai and MMA and work out and go for swims and go for hikes and just be active and in nature and that kind of thing, and be with others who are just doing the same, because I love the vibe when you\u2019re doing something difficult together and then afterwards you hang out and you talk about how hard it was and the camaraderie there. And have it be an environment where people can come and have these peak experiences that I\u2019ve explored in the psychedelic realm. So basically combining health and fitness and wellness with these peak experiences that I think are incredibly beneficial and therapeutic to people. And then mic\u2019ing up and having whatever conversation we like to have! I mean you also asked me earlier why I interviewed Bobby the first time. And the answer is two-fold: One, his office was \u2014 I could see his office from my apartment window, it was right across the street. But the other answer is, even at that time it wasn\u2019t only Bitcoin-focused, but I was working in Shanghai and I was like, This is not enough! My job is not satisfying me, and the tech industry was really booming there at the time and really getting underway. And I liked that industry because I felt that it was solutions-oriented and it was building solutions to our problems instead of just complaining about things! And I was like, I\u2019m gonna reach out to these people and say, How about we record a chat? And that\u2019s a weird thing to do, and I got a lot of No\u2019s, but once I got the ball rolling and people realized I wasn\u2019t crazy, then I would get referrals from people and say, Do you know anybody else doing interesting stuff? And Bobby I think I hit him up individually and he referred me to some other people. But yeah man like what\u2019s better than hanging out with someone and feeling good and then mic\u2019ing up with no time horizon and saying like, What do you want to explore? Let\u2019s hit it! Let\u2019s go deep in any direction and see what we come up with! And maybe we don\u2019t come up with anything novel and just connect, and maybe we do come up with something unique and we both learn something! You know that\u2019s kind of the ideal day for me. And of course family and all that kind of stuff, but yeah that\u2019s what the vision looks like right now. We\u2019ll see how it turns out. So I think that\u2019s a vague kind of goal, but the guiding force is just, We are all starting to have this opportunity where we really can experience what freedom and sovereignty is, and I think we should take advantage of that by allowing ourselves to be who we are and continue to try to understand what and who that is, and shove it out there in the world and see what happens!"}

I\u2019ve got a question for ya! So I started that [podcast] because like you said I wanted to do an open kind of conversation and then do some rapid-fire questions at the end just to kind of delve into people\u2019s minds, a bit of human interest. And it actually is kind of fun to hear how different people answer rapid-fire questions, although I\u2019ve given it up recently because I just more enjoy the open conversations. But lately if I\u2019m just having long-form discussions with people, like 2-hour discussions, then a podcast titled Rapid-Fire may be somewhat misleading or confusing! What\u2019s in a name for you?"}

I\u2019m looking to leave all this out of the chat, but like I think that it\u2019s confusing to me in the sense that \u2014 the title\u2019s not confusing to me \u2014 but the dilemma. Because it\u2019s like, do I get 30 minutes of this dude and sum it up? Or do I go the full 2-hours? You know? And I would probably put it into two separate channels, just because I don\u2019t think that one takes away from the other, but as someone who \u2014 I always want to go full-bore. Me personally. And that like Rapid-Fire I\u2019m like, Well maybe I could just cheat-code it! So it\u2019s a dilemma for me. But at the end of the day man I love what you\u2019re doing. I love both of \u2018em! And I don\u2019t care, I mean what do we care? If they want to they will listen to it. And you see the numbers, but like, I like the long form, for me. Because that\u2019s just more meaningful for me! And the short form has a purpose, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t, but if I see both maybe I\u2019ll jump on the short form and skip the long form, I don\u2019t know! But dude seriously, I really just want to hear you everywhere! I don\u2019t even want to hear you interview people, and I love your interviews. But I love hearing you and what your thoughts are! And I think that\u2019s really hard to get that across in an interview because you could share, but I just want to hear you speak. I think that you have a really interesting perspective on this outside of money, you know? You\u2019re on that philosophical bent! What is this doing for us? Because at the end of the day it\u2019s a tool, and it\u2019s just a tool! It\u2019s maybe the greatest tool we\u2019ve ever invented, but I don\u2019t know, maybe fire is! Maybe the printing press is. Maybe the Internet is. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna play out over the next 5,000 years, what made one thing more important than the other. I mean you can\u2019t have Bitcoin probably without the Internet. But the Internet without Bitcoin is not much the way it\u2019s gone! So I don\u2019t know! But I love hearing you talk about things, I love the way you ask questions, I thought the way you cut into Schiff was gold! I\u2019m done with him now! I was done with him for a while, but I was like, Yep after John asked that question, there\u2019s no more! It\u2019s pointless until he\u2019s willing to acknowledge the question you\u2019re actually asking! And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing all day long! So I\u2019m just enamored with you. We didn\u2019t get into a lot of things, but you live in Thailand, you\u2019re in Newfoundland now, you\u2019re from there, you can\u2019t get home. You\u2019re a wanderer but you\u2019re settling down. I think it\u2019s wild man, and I\u2019m so glad we connected. I really enjoyed our conversation and I just want to hear more from you! Clubhouse is a different animal, because it\u2019s more talk radio and it\u2019s more new to experts, and once in a while these experts get into expert conversations about different topics and I love the combination of people there. But at the end of the day it\u2019s not as fulfilling to me. It\u2019s kind of like Reality TV. I could jump in and just waste some time there. I go there to veg out actually. To listen to other people to be entertained. I don\u2019t go there to share my thoughts because I\u2019m just happy to hear everyone else\u2019s! And I was happy to hear you get the opportunity to ask Peter a real question in a live format that he couldn\u2019t sidestep without his own words and edit out. So that was dope. So I just want to hear you everywhere, I loved your article in Bitcoin Magazine, I liked your take on things, I\u2019m just so happy we got to connect."}

You get to dial in with a person or a group of people and you really get to take the conversation somewhere! Like I\u2019m doing one with Breedlove and Richard James next week and it\u2019s looking at Jordan Peterson\u2019s book Maps of Meaning and we\u2019re just going to explore that book and relate it to Bitcoin in various degrees, and that\u2019s the stuff that I really enjoy! Because like I said about my future, I\u2019d love it if that could be part of my day, these intellectual conversations where we kind of ask the big questions and try to foil around and fumble around with them! And try to use each other to help refine them for ourselves. I mean that\u2019s what gets me off. So the social media domain is fun and we like to have fun there and banter and other stuff, but I love this and man I couldn\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate, one, the work that you\u2019re doing \u2014 I love your work as well, and also for having me on for this chat, it\u2019s been awesome!"}

Today is another deep episode. We\u2019re actually getting towards the end of the line here and covering some of the last ground in the macroeconomic domain and tying it back actually to some philosophy towards the end. Today we\u2019re going to talk a bit about how Bitcoin is an elemental innovation, tying us back to Episode 1 where we discussed Stone Age technologies including Fire, Water, and Missiles. We\u2019re making the case that Bitcoin is an elemental invention akin to one of these Stone Age technologies. Which as a reminder if you haven\u2019t seen those prior episodes I highly recommend you go check those out because they build a long and strong intellectual edifice to get us to this point. Secondly we\u2019re gonna talk about fiat currency and how it\u2019s a contaminated form of money that leads to socioeconomic decay. And we\u2019re gonna go into interest rates, an area that\u2019s commonly misunderstood by even people that are typically considered financially sophisticated. Then we\u2019re gonna talk a bit about central bank price manipulation, how that influences markets. We\u2019re also gonna talk about market competition and the law of decimation and how that plays out in nature and throughout history. Then we\u2019re gonna get into the philosophical domain, and we\u2019re gonna touch on a bit of Stoicism and how Saylor has used this in his own life and how he sees its importance in markets in general. Finally we\u2019ll leave off with a bit of discussion on antifragility and the vitality of life. So I\u2019m excited for this one, another crazy episode with the incredibly brilliant Michael Saylor. So with that let\u2019s dive in!"}

It\u2019s how we\u2019ve developed everything, essentially! And I\u2019m reminded of a quote by Alfred North Whitehead that I\u2019ll paraphrase. He said that it\u2019s common wisdom for people to say you should think before you act, but that in fact civilization advances by us being able to execute more important operations without having to think about them! So we\u2019re actually \u2014 when we can embed these certain important actions in a protocol that we don\u2019t need to think about as much, it frees us up to do other things \u2014 that\u2019s kind of the layers upon which we\u2019ve built civilization. It just seems like this Digital Age we\u2019re going into is something radically new! It seems to be as profound as the Renaissance, or as profound as the Enlightenment! Do you see it that way? Are we co-evolving with the tools that we\u2019re creating and that the next 500 years are gonna be something so fundamentally different than what history has been that it will be difficult to recognize it in a few hundred years?"}

Maybe one interesting thing is just the science of sterilization. Germs \u2014 modern medicine and the awareness and the importance of sterilizing instruments and the way that the disease spreads! Immunology. Once we figured that out, we were able to go from living 50 years to living 70 years because we realized that every time we entered into a medical procedure including the birth of a child, we were entering into a non-sterile environment that was life-threatening, soul-sucking, life-stealing. The death rate from childbirth was huge, right? The average life expectancy was short, and we needed that breakthrough to realize that we were swimming in germs, and the very simple solution is: Wash your hands! Sterilize your instruments! And you put that together with antibiotics and human life expectancy jumps by 50%! What if we\u2019re actually doing economics with dirty money? And so we\u2019ve been using monetary energy which is bleeding, right? It\u2019s the same way as operating with non-sterile instruments, and the patient keeps dying and we don\u2019t know why. The significance of Bitcoin is: We\u2019re going from defective money, which is somewhere between toxic \u2014 it may just been ineffective, bleeding 2, 3, 4% a year\u2014or it\u2019s toxic when it gets to -10% or -15% real yield. So using toxic money, how is that different than using toxic instruments when I commit surgery on you? How is it different than feeding you toxic food? I think we\u2019re breaking through this new world, we sterilize our instruments, we encrypt our money, we\u2019re moving to a science of non-toxic economic energy. Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning. She died of cancer from the radiation. They didn\u2019t realize that radiation killed you, that it caused cancer. There\u2019s a lot of basics in life that we don\u2019t understand. A big breakthrough in health was when we realized that sugar was toxic. My mother didn\u2019t know that sugar was toxic! Conventional wisdom and governmental advice was you need your four favorite food groups and pursue a low-fat diet but starch and sugar was fine. And of course now we know that too much starch and too much sugar makes you insulin-resistant, makes you Type-2 diabetic, gives you cancer. My mother became diabetic, became overweight, got cancer. We thought it was just unfortunate. The doctors said, We don\u2019t know why these things are happening, it\u2019s just unfortunate. If I could go back in time I\u2019d be like, I know exactly why it happens! I know exactly how to solve it now! Like, don\u2019t eat sugar, don\u2019t eat starch \u2014 stop eating! Fast! I never eat before 1 in the afternoon, I only eat in an 8-hour window and I\u2019ll go 2\u20133 days and I won\u2019t eat. I adopt fasting and I won\u2019t drink anything with sugar in it. You want to live a long time, don\u2019t dose yourself with sugar, it\u2019s toxic! The instruments are toxic. The germs are toxic. We killed George Washington \u2014 we bled him to death! Toxic. The money is toxic. That\u2019s fundamentally the issue. The money is toxic. I mean, that\u2019s the fundamental issue with inflation, and if we segue into the discussion of inflation, everybody keeps thinking there is no inflation because everybody focuses upon a market basket of consumer goods. And if you look in the US and you look in Europe, they leave food and energy out of the basket of consumer goods and they say, We left out the highly volatile food and energy from the index. Well highly volatile means it went up! [And if you put them in, 12:06] the number would change! Volatility in other words is the signal! We\u2019ve left out everything that actually changes in price from our price index. It literally is like a Jedi Mind Trick, and it\u2019s like a triple mind trick. It\u2019s like: We have a consumer price index and we\u2019ve left the prices that vary out of the index. We have a consumer price index \u2014 well first of all it\u2019s not a scalar, it\u2019s a vector. It\u2019s an indimensional vector dynamically changing in time \u2014 you\u2019ve just created a scalar. We\u2019ve created a market basket of things that we think you want. Yes, your basket is what I want! The market basket of things that you want does not include assets. No! I would never want to buy assets, only rich people buy assets! Poor people do not buy assets! How did poor people get rich? You have to buy assets to go from being poor to being rich. I didn\u2019t go from being poor to being wealthy by not buying assets or not creating assets \u2014 you create them or you buy them. So the entire field of inflation is defective, and the irony is that 99% of the economists that talk about it, they\u2019ve already accepted the notion that a market basket of consumer products and services is acceptable, and it\u2019s acceptable to throw out energy and good. And I\u2019ve never seen an economist say, Why don\u2019t we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is gonna want to buy by the time they\u2019re 32? And here\u2019s one thing: Early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time I\u2019m 32. How do I do that? I need to buy a bond that pays me $75,000 a year in interest risk-free, and I need for the $75,000 a year to pay my living expenses. And if the interest rate was 7% then I\u2019d need $1 Million for that. But if the interest rate goes to 0.7% I\u2019d need $10 Million for that. So from 2010 to 2020 the interest rate went down to 60 basis points on a 10-year government bond which meant that the bond went from $1 Million to $10 Million, which meant that the 22-year old was suffering from 22% inflation on early retirement! But because that\u2019s not in the basket \u2014because that\u2019s not something that you would ever want to give them \u2014 there\u2019s no inflation! You can actually track it and you can see that the inflation rate changes across a thousand different \u2014 if you just started with a simple principle: Inflation is a basket of products, services, or assets. If you just did that, that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of saying, Oh it\u2019s possible the Sun revolves around the Earth, it\u2019s possible the Earth revolves around the Sun \u2014 let\u2019s find out which! Has anybody ever asked the question whether or not the basket should include assets? Or products or services? No one\u2019s even questioning the most basic premise! It\u2019s pernicious rule of propaganda, and it\u2019s attributed to Joseph Goebbels in the Nazi regime who said \u2014 and it\u2019s also attributed to [Ogilvy 15:31], so maybe it\u2019s apocryphal \u2014 but he said, All of our focus groups show us and tell us we can\u2019t tell people what to think. But we can tell them what to think about! I cannot change your mind once you\u2019ve made it up\u2014and if you have an opinion \u2014 but I can get you to focus upon something. So if I just keep saying inflation, CPI, and it didn\u2019t go up and this is what it is\u2014When\u2019s the last time 100 Million people said, What we really wanted to buy was early retirement? I didn\u2019t even know that was a product I could buy! Because I couldn\u2019t conceive of it! Well it is a product you can buy: It\u2019s a government 30-year bond that yields 6% interest in a non-inflationary environment \u2014 that\u2019s a risk-free retirement. You can buy that! Right now, the problem is at 140 basis points that would cost you $30 Million for $60,000 a year. How do I make that at $75,000 a year salary saving $15,000? If I\u2019m making $500,000 a year and I save $100,000\u2014you know, I pay $200,000 in tax, I make $300,000, I save $100,000 \u2014 if I save $100,000 for 20 years I\u2019ve got $2 Million, and investing that in a government bond at 60 basis points or 100 basis points, you get nothing! [17:07] So the problem starts with the fact that inflation is misdefined. The right way to think about it is: Every single product, service, or asset has an inflation co-efficient. And the inflationary co-efficient, that\u2019s the rate at which the price will change as I pump fiat into the money system. And so the co-efficients vary, and they\u2019re a function of the scarcity of the asset, the demand of the asset, the information content of the asset, the material cost or the variable cost of the asset, and then the modularity of the asset. If I can stamp out the asset a million times out of a factory, it\u2019s gonna be less inflationary because the fixed cost is higher and the variable cost is lower. Mobile phones will not be inflationary because everything\u2019s in the fab. Software will not be inflationary because there\u2019s no variable cost. Streaming music on Amazon Music or Apple Music will not be inflationary because I can stream it a billion times. A Picasso will be inflationary because there\u2019s only 20, 50, 100. The best 5 acres of beachfront property in the middle of Miami Beach will be inflationary to the extent people want Miami Beach. 5 acres in Ohio will not be inflationary because there\u2019s a lot of land in the world. The only land people want is in the middle of New York, the middle of London, the Hamptons, Miami Beach, the middle of LA, the middle of San Francisco, the middle of Tokyo. You fly across this country and look down, there\u2019s enough land to park 10 Billion people on 5 acres each! It\u2019s just gotta be in demand and scarce."}

So the co-efficient itself in my mind would be a product of the scarcity of the good or service relative to the scarcity of the money it\u2019s denominated in, such that if the money supply is outpacing the production of the good or service, that good or service would inflate in price, right? So to your point it\u2019s not a single variable \u2014 it\u2019s not CPI is inflation \u2014 everything has its own inflation rate. The second part of that question would be: Why is the narrative surrounding inflation so distorted? Do you think it\u2019s intentional by governments that are clearly heavily indebted? I don\u2019t see any equitable benefit to inflation whatsoever, it\u2019s purely a mechanism for reallocating wealth, and I don\u2019t understand why the narrative\u2019s so distorted!"}

The whole point of paradigm shifts is: Everybody agreed that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Everybody agreed the world was flat. Everybody agreed that humans would never fly. Everybody agrees on stuff until they realize that they\u2019re just utterly and totally and horrifically wrong! So in this particular case, I blow a bunch of liquidity into the system. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s $50 Trillion worth of energy and I blow $10 Trillion worth of money in the system. So there\u2019s still $50 Trillion worth of energy, but now the money is diluted by 20%, right? So if I have a product and I can measure the pure energy content of the product, then if it\u2019s 100% pure energy, the price has gotta go up by 20% if I expand the money supply by 20% assuming it\u2019s completely liquid and in demand. What\u2019s an example of that? Maybe a bond! A pure financial instrument, something that \u2014"}

This is why proof of work in Bitcoin is [inaudible 21:36]. If it takes me a tangible amount of energy to produce that thing then it\u2019s inflation co-efficient is going to be like 100%. And on the other hand, the cost to produce a streaming YouTube video, the energy content is 1% of the value added or the value of use. And 99% of the value-in-use is information and non-scarce information. So it\u2019s got a variable cost of 1%. An iPhone\u2019s got a variable cost of 30, 35, 40%. Everything\u2019s got a different variable cost. Gold\u2019s got a much higher variable cost, right? Because it\u2019s holding its energy. So when you look at all these things you\u2019ll be able to calculate different inflation co-efficients and therefore different inflation rates across an array of thousands of things. It\u2019d be different inflation rates in New York City, Manhattan versus farmland in Kansas. It\u2019d be different! So you can\u2019t really say, Oh this asset class. There will be different inflation rates on different stocks. You notice that if the cash flows are likely to continue from the stock, or less affected by inflation, then it\u2019s gonna go up. So I think the pernicious mistake everybody makes is: They don\u2019t really think about energy density and information density of their products, services, and assets. They\u2019re not applying conservation of energy. If the law of conservation of energy applies, when I increase the money supply by 20% and if the energy is constant, then all of the numbers have to change. And if they didn\u2019t change on the deflationary products, they must have changed more on something else! So you can\u2019t very well be printing 10% more money and not have the inflation. It\u2019s just: We\u2019re choosing to pick just 1% of the things that are inflated \u2014 the deflationary assets we put them in a bucket. And it\u2019s almost too easy. If I get to throw out all assets, all real estate, all stocks, all bonds, and then I get to throw out energy, and then I get to throw away food, well how could you possibly generate inflation? Because you could print a hundred-kazillion-trillion-billion dollars and the cost of free, streaming Twitter and YouTube is not going up!"}

The great majority of people, not only do they not think there\u2019s inflation, you literally have politicians lamenting that they can\u2019t create inflation and how important it is to create inflation, even as they\u2019re inflating every scarce asset on Earth to the point where no one can afford \u2014 look, Robert, like, I\u2019m a rich man! I\u2019m a very wealthy man! I can\u2019t afford to buy a house in the Hamptons! Like I\u2019ll go look at these things and I\u2019m like, Who\u2019s paying $47 Million? They\u2019re selling houses for $25 Million on 2 acres! I\u2019m like, Are you guys out of your minds? Or you go to New York City and someone\u2019s paying $25 Million for a 5,000 square foot apartment. $5,000 a square foot! At the end of the day, it\u2019s obscene. And what you can see is: We\u2019re running 10\u201320% inflation for the past decade, we\u2019re just running it on all of the scarce luxury assets that have high energy value. I mean, what\u2019s the definition of scarce, right? Maybe the definition of scarce is that it has high energy value, because if I could stamp out a billion-trillion of \u2019em for the same unit of energy I must be diluting the energy down, right?"}

It\u2019s like I\u2019m burning myself to death and I\u2019m calculating the temperature on the counter 6 feet away and I\u2019m burning but I need to keep turning the thermostat down. And I guess it\u2019s like they\u2019re just not feeling the pain. And because of that it takes us to the issue of interest, right? If you think inflation is not coming so you keep printing money and you keep driving the interest rate down, the problem we have is really just a war on currency, a war on time, we render the money toxic if you hold the money. Once you understand that the real inflation rate is 10\u201315% because that\u2019s how the assets were [clocking 28:10], then you realize that any currency you\u2019re holding is draining energy from your life at 10% a year. It\u2019s almost like I put in a battery that drains 1\u20132% a month. I can\u2019t store energy! You know another metaphor for what happens in the human body when you can\u2019t store energy? It\u2019s like, Robert if I took you and I dropped you in the middle of the Arctic Circle and it was 20 below, your body would start losing energy at a rapid rate, you\u2019d freeze to death. It\u2019s literally like I come into your office and I crank the temperature down 20 degrees and I\u2019m freezing you to death because I\u2019m pulling the energy off your skin. And so what do you do? Insulate, cover up, right? But what if you can\u2019t? If you\u2019re a wealthy person you put on a fur coat, right? Or maybe you\u2019re smart enough to realize: What do wealthy people do? You drop them in the Arctic and they get on their jet and they fly to the Caribbean where it\u2019s warm because they can! And what do you do if you\u2019re poor? I drop you in the Arctic, or even worse I go to your hometown and I just turn the temperature down to 20 below and you can\u2019t leave! But you know it\u2019s like I slowly freeze you to death. I don\u2019t do it fast. You don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s happening if it happened at a gradual enough rate. It\u2019s like, I know I\u2019m working hard I\u2019m just not getting ahead. I\u2019m working hard but I\u2019m not getting ahead, because every time I put money in the bank the price of everything keeps going up. The price of a house in Miami Beach it was $1 Million on the street where I live, and then it\u2019s 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, $10 Million. I\u2019m not talking about every decade, I\u2019m talking about every year! I\u2019m talking 2000\u20132010 during that administration we were printing money so fast that we had this housing boom and everybody that owned houses were happy \u2014 they\u2019re refinancing their houses \u2014 but you look at it and you\u2019re like, How is it possible that people bought this house in 1998 for $1 Million and I\u2019m being asked to pay $10 Million for the same house? If you happen to be working for cash \u2014 it\u2019s what Pomp would say \u2014 if you\u2019re working for cash and paying taxes and then you\u2019re putting the cash in the bank, then you\u2019re suffering from inflation \u2014"}

And so that actually takes us to this issue of real yield, right?

But let\u2019s just say it\u2019s only 10% just to be nice. Well then you\u2019re looking at a real yield of -10%! You\u2019ve never seen that number printed in any kind of public media. No one would dare say we have a negative real yield of -10%, it would create a panic! But if you did think negative real yield of -10%, what happens next? You cycle through and you say, Well, if my cash flows of the stock aren\u2019t going up by more than 10%, that\u2019s diluted. The only equity you can buy where you\u2019re gonna make out on is where the company\u2019s able to grow its cash flows more than 10% a year, right? And then you gotta buy it at a decent price. So if your cash flows are growing 20\u201330% a year maybe it\u2019s good deal. That\u2019s why people like tech like Facebook or Google or Amazon because they did for a while! I don\u2019t know if they will going forward. It\u2019s a lot harder, over the next 36 months it seems much less likely that you\u2019ll see 20% cash flows. Will you see 10%? I don\u2019t \u2014 what percentage of the S&P 500 will grow cash flows more than 10% this year? Any? 5%? 10%? Probably not more than 10%, right? We could figure it out but if you\u2019re not doing that then you\u2019re diluted. Of course that means that any fixed bonds that aren\u2019t generating 10%, they\u2019re long-term diluted. So where does that leave Bitcoin? Well Bitcoin\u2019s got a positive real yield because you\u2019re not getting hit with that -10% currency debasement."}

Do you think that we don\u2019t have a competitive market for everything in this country? It\u2019s obscenely competitive! And so what you\u2019ve got if you look at the NASDAQ is you have like 5 companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft \u2014 those 5. And aren\u2019t they responsible for like 80% of the game? Everybody else is competing and it\u2019s a competitive market! And what does that mean? It means it\u2019s hard to grow 20% a year because whenever you do anything someone else is copying you and they\u2019re pushing on you. So unless you get a dominant digital network with a near-monopoly with these massive, exploding economies of scale on a zero variable cost, low variable cost, it\u2019s very very difficult to perform. And most of the S&P isn\u2019t! To the extent that the S&P isn\u2019t Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, they\u2019re just a bunch of companies competing with each other, so you would think that they would grow at the productivity growth rate of the overall company which is 2\u20133%. If you had hard money \u2014 by the way, coming back to that theory of Bitcoin network value \u2014 Bitcoin network value goes through the roof, skyrockets in the early days when there\u2019s massive adoption and massive technology explosion, but in the later stages of the S-curve when it\u2019s fully diffused and when it\u2019s mature, it just grows with the GDP. It grows with the productivity of the people in the network. If they grow 2% a year, it grows 2% a year! So in a mature equity market you would expect equity indexes, equity prices to grow with the GDP. If they\u2019re growing faster, it\u2019s the monetary expansion, right? Expand the monetary supply 7%, expand the GDP 1%, S&P should go up 8%! It\u2019s gonna be disproportionate. The big tech, the leading-edge, innovative tech, is gonna be double, triple, quadruple that, and then the trailing-edge laggards are gonna be tanking, and then everyone that\u2019s working their asses off as hard as they can is gonna be barely keeping up! Because you have to do 100,000 things right just to stay in business in a real Darwinian capitalist economy. It\u2019s like: Being flat means defeating 99% of the rest of the market \u2014 being flat. To be up, you have to, you know \u2014 Amazon\u2019s up because they beat 15,000 companies! The next two are just slightly okay, and there\u2019s some that are flat, and everybody else is destroyed because of the natural effect there."}

If I take my own business \u2014 I became public in 1998 \u2014 there\u2019s a 99% mortality rate. 99 out of the 100 companies I competed with are gone. Out of my peers, I\u2019m the only person \u2014 I\u2019m talking about 100 publicly traded companies \u2014 there\u2019s probably 500 CEOs that launched a company with 20, 30, 50, $100 Million of capital, and they\u2019re all gone! That\u2019s what the open market, the free market, will do. And it is what it is. I mean that\u2019s why the human race is what they are. There\u2019s always someone. And when they attack, if you\u2019re distracted, if you\u2019re arrogant, if you\u2019re fat, dumb, happy, comfortable, they\u2019re going to eat you! And if you\u2019re half-focused or de-focused, they\u2019re gonna take your arm off! And if you\u2019re completely focused, you can react. If there\u2019s something they\u2019re doing that\u2019s good, you channel it, you inherit it, you evolve, you live and you grow stronger. And otherwise you shrink and they squeeze you out of the entire market. There\u2019s something I observed and again it\u2019s very Stoic, it\u2019s: Everybody thinks when you\u2019re young you wanna acquire as much as you can acquire. So young men are acquisitive. Young business people are acquisitive. Can you acquire the thing? That\u2019s generally the easiest hurdle to jump. The next question is: Can you maintain the thing? Can you stay competitive? That\u2019s 10 times harder! And the biggest hurdle is: Are you going to be able to commercialize the thing or profit from it? Can you buy something or build something and continuously improve it forever so that you\u2019re competitive and then do it in a manner that is cheaper such that you can charge more for it than it costs you to do that thing. That\u2019s obscenely hard! So typically everybody think that they can acquire something, then when they realize the maintenance requirements they fail, and then very people ever get to the point where they could commercialize something. By the way you can apply it to a boat: Everybody wants to buy a boat, and then they\u2019re like, Oh my God! This is really expensive to maintain a boat and I can\u2019t afford to maintain the boat. But if they buy the boat, they gotta spend 10% a year to maintain it. And then at some point the question is, Can you enjoy the boat? They\u2019re like, Oh! I\u2019m spending all this money on the boat but I never have time to go and use the boat \u2014 this is just crazy! This is weighing around my neck! I gotta get rid of this! It\u2019s an example of being too ambitious in your acquisitiveness, and it illustrates the law of decimation. And the law of decimation is: In the ancient Roman republic if the legion screwed up, they killed 1 out of every 10 men in the legion. Actually the made the 9 kill the 10th in order to remind them that they should stay disciplined."}

They didn\u2019t kill them all because then there would be no legion left! But 1 out of 10 is gonna die if you break ranks and retreat so it was their ultimate punishment, the law of decimation. But you can apply it to anything in life, Robert, but it goes like this: The universe tends towards entropy and disorder. If something will go wrong it does go wrong. That\u2019s Murphy\u2019s law. The law of decimation is: 1/10th of all the moving parts in anything will break in any given year. If you have 10 employees, 1 will quit or become unhappy. If you have 10 moving parts, 1 will break. If you have 10 plans, 1 will blow up in your face. If you have 10 features, 1 of them will stop working. If you have 100? 10 of them will stop working. If you spend $100 Million on something, you have to spend $10 Million to maintain it. You\u2019re gonna have to divert 10% of the cost of anything to maintain something. I talked about, Steel will last forever \u2014 if you maintain it! Most people don\u2019t maintain it! It costs a lot of money to paint a steel ship. Most people, they budget for the acquisition, and then they underestimate the maintenance because they don\u2019t have the humility or the life experience. This is the problem with building Rube Goldberg devices in the crypto network. That\u2019s the problem with all the complexity with Etherium and all the complexity with some of these things: It sounds good on paper, but when you put 187 moving parts into something and when 1 of them breaks and the entire thing crashes and burns and you die, it wasn\u2019t worth it! When you\u2019re young, you overestimate the value of functionality and acquisition, and you underestimate how expensive it\u2019s going to be to maintain things, and then you really underestimate this last issue: Can you enjoy it? This is a basic rule of life: Can I buy the thing? Can I maintain the thing? Can I enjoy the thing? Men are always reaching beyond their fingertips. Sometimes women too. They want too much. They\u2019re empire-builders. This is why Napoleon should not have gone to Moscow. This is why Hitler should have not have gone to Moscow. This is why you don\u2019t fight a war on two fronts. And this is the essence of Stoicism, but Stoicism is really a philosophy that is very consistent with thermodynamics and entropy and complexity theory. And if you\u2019ve ever run anything complicated or built anything complicated or have been responsible for anything complicated, you know stuff breaks!"}

It just pops up over and over again! And my only real explanation is just: friction, randomness, chaos, life, corrosion, weather, termites, bugs, bacteria. The same would be true with your body, right? If you\u2019re talking about maintaining yourself. You\u2019ve got to actually allocate time and energy to maintain yourself and a lot of times people under-invest in their own health. And then when they under-invest in those things they blame it on genetics or they blame it on some unfortunate occurrence. We don\u2019t know why these this happened it\u2019s very unfortunately \u2014 these things just happen sometimes. I\u2019ll end with one thought on Stoicism. And Nicholas Taleb would appreciate this one too. It\u2019s like, The words don\u2019t matter \u2014 the action matters. Okay? Words are just words. And that applies to Stoics: you and me and Marcus Aurelius. I think one of the great paradoxes of history is Marcus Aurelius was the last emperor in the line of the Antonines during the golden age of Rome and there was Trajan, and there was Hadrian, Marcus Antoninus, etc., and for about 100 years that was the Pax Romana, and each of those emperors was elected based on virtue as an adult and he adopted his heir, and they typically adopted a 40-year old emperor who had had a career in the military of virtue and he was tough and responsible and grounded in reality. And if you\u2019re a general in the army campaigning and you get drunk and screw around your soldiers put a knife in you! You\u2019re not gonna make it! In order to keep the respect and stay alive in war-time around a bunch of guys with weapons, you better be a good leader and they better respect you because you\u2019re leading them to their death, if they don\u2019t respect you! So if you actually rose through that meritocracy, maybe you had a chance. So Marcus Aurelius writes the Meditations and it\u2019s the quintessential text on Stoicism. And he says, Just because you can do a thing doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing. He said, Soon you will have forgotten all and all will have forgotten you, and you should know your place in the universe, and you should submit yourself and do the right thing for everyone else, and that\u2019s all good! But at the end of the day, the single most important decision Marcus Aurelius made in his entire career, in his life, was the decision on an heir, and when it came time to make that decision he failed miserably and he appointed his son Commodus to be the emperor. And Commodus was a minor and of weak moral and intellectual constitution and in no way shape or form qualified to be emperor of all the known world. And by so doing that Marcus Aurelius plunged the Roman Empire into chaos and turmoil for hundreds of years, resulting in the deaths of millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of people \u2014 awful! Awful! And there\u2019s your philosopher-king! He\u2019s remembered today as somebody that\u2019s written a good book and had been a great Stoic. But if you look at his actions, the actual action he took was the least Stoic, most foolish, most painful action of any of his forbears and it just makes the blood curdle!"}

It\u2019s just not in the near-term. Yeah, there\u2019s a certain terrifying beauty in nature. There are no ugly animals. You look at a bird that is beautiful. You look at a lion in the wild, it\u2019s beautiful. No one\u2019s got a mangy coat, there\u2019s no unhealthy anything, and that\u2019s our ideal of beauty, right? We think nature is beautiful, all the trees are beautiful, the plants are beautiful, the birds are beautiful, they chirp their beautiful sounds, the flowers are beautiful. What they don\u2019t really think about is what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, because they\u2019ve got this simple zoo backyard view of nature. The truth is, everything\u2019s at its finest when tomorrow is uncertain. When the life of the creature is uncertain. I\u2019ve actually got this beautiful banyan vine trees in the back of my house in Florida. One day on a beautiful sunny day I walked by and I stood and stared at the tree and I saw a bunch of ants running up and down. And when I traced the ants I saw that there were thousands of ants and I saw that there was a centipede. Some kind of millipede about a hundred times bigger than a normal ant. And those ants had decided that they\u2019re going to eat that. They were actually gonna haul that millipede back to their queen as dinner. And they attacked it relentlessly, relentlessly. And I watched hundreds and hundreds and then thousands and then thousands of ants going into this one millipede. And it\u2019s fighting for its life and I swear I watched for 45 minutes like a war non-stop on a beautiful sunny day. If you looked around you would\u2019ve saw grass and blue sky and pretty water and birds chirping, but there was knock-down, drag-out war to devour this millipede and it\u2019s fighting for its life. And I watched it crawl up the tree and the ants dragged it down and it did everything it could and they kept coming and it just had this horrific, terrifying, sad conclusion. It\u2019s gonna die. Unless a massive rainstorm spins up to blow water down and create some disruption it\u2019s got no chance. It\u2019s going to get eaten alive. And it\u2019s horrific and it\u2019s terrifying, and that\u2019s life! That\u2019s nature! And then you start to realize, on all those pretty National Geographic TV shows, you see the lions attack the antelope or the gazelle and they try and this miss like, Well, no dinner for you tonight! No, the antelope trot off happy with their babies and the lions trot off happy with a little smirk. And everybody\u2019s like, That\u2019s about as much nature as they want! Nobody wants any more nature! When you think about it a bit more you realize, Well they\u2019re gonna miss 3\u20134 days, they\u2019re gonna hit 1 of those a week, and the 99% of them are gonna live but 1 of them is gonna die, and over 3 years they\u2019re all gonna die. And over 3 years they were all gonna be eaten by the lions. And that\u2019s nature! Every week that goes by, it\u2019s like they\u2019re clicking on a carousel. And the oldest one is getting slower, and a little bit more tired, and a little bit less flexible, and if they don\u2019t get the old one, they\u2019re gonna get the unlucky one. And that\u2019s why every one of them is beautiful! Because they\u2019re all in the prime of their life! And the same is true with all the predators: they\u2019re all in the prime of their life. When they get a little bit old, a little bit hurt, they get driven out of the tribe or out of the pride and that\u2019s the end of it. So in nature the life expectancy of those wolves or those predators or those lions is 5 years, and in the zoo it\u2019s 15 years. Now if you want to see a fat, mangy, lame one, you\u2019ll find one in the zoo. You won\u2019t find one in the wild. And the same is true with the rest. And when those two herds, when they go at each other like that viciously, they\u2019re both strengthening. You take away the wolves from the deer, the deer overpopulate, they eat all of the trees, the trees all die, the trees die, they destabilize the embankment of the river, the river erodes, the riverbank gets screwed up, all the greenery dies, all the deer are gone, all the wolves are gone. You wanna fix the river? You put the wolves back in. The wolves scare away the deer, the trees grow, the roots stabilize the bank, the river flows, all the wildlife returns. This beautiful thing we call nature is in continual dynamic equilibrium, and everything about it is getting stronger and harder and faster and getting culled all the time. And mother nature is supreme, and men with delusions that they will defeat her are gonna be disappointed, right? I guess the great challenge is this paradox: the paradox is the paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper. We see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards. We can try to shake our fist at mother nature, we can defeat all of those natural forces, and if we try to do that, the energy consumption goes up exponentially. And eventually it goes up to such a level that we deplete ourselves of energy, and we end up like those natives on Easter Island where you chop down every tree to build your monuments to your gods and pretty soon there\u2019s no canoes and pretty soon there\u2019s no fish and pretty soon there\u2019s no food and pretty soon there\u2019s no you! All you\u2019ve got is your monuments to your god and you\u2019re all dead because you depleted the energy in the ecosystem in pursuit of over-engineering your reality."}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-9-FnAbOJZV4mM/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 9 | Economics, Inflation, Interest Rates, and Natural Competition", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:03:38]: Okay! So that was Episode 9 of Saylor here at the Saylor Series and wow! What an episode! We started off this series actually with a discussion of Stone Age technologies, which Michael laid out his thesis of how mankind is the dominant animal in the world because we channel energy across time and space more intelligently than any other animal. And he really built the foundation by drilling into our use of fire, one of the primordial energy networks, our use of water as a hydraulic energy network for overcoming gravity, and our use of missiles for actually competing at a distance. And in that lens, if we consider that that is the overarching goal of humanity is to more intelligently or more precisely channel energy across time and space, Bitcoin is an elemental innovation. It\u2019s the only system we\u2019ve ever had throughout history that allows us to channel energy effectively at the speed of light, and store it in a way that is virtually totally loss-minimized. There\u2019s no unexpected inflation for instance, and there\u2019s very minimal transaction fees, just enough to sustain the network. [1:05:06] And you could contrast this with something like gold, which we touched on earlier, that just depreciates at 2% per year at least, or something like fiat currency which tends to depreciate much faster. So it takes a lot maybe to get to here. It\u2019s a whole re-framing of your worldview, but I think Saylor just does an excellent job of that. And I love the example he gave describing immunology \u2014 another one of these elemental innovations \u2014 where we figured out antiseptics, we figured out how to use clean medical instruments and disinfectants and whatnot, and the discovery of penicillin for instance \u2014 all of these things that helped us insulate ourselves from the entropy of microbes to conduct medical and biological experiments and operations with less exposure to the entropy of nature just catapulted our life expectancy! Almost overnight it went from say 50-year average life expectancy to 70 years. So I wonder \u2014 and I love the way he described it as, Doing business, we\u2019re conducting economics thus far in history with dirty money, with contaminated money. And you could analogize this to doing surgery with contaminated medical instruments! If you don\u2019t decontaminate your medical instruments and you try to perform surgery on someone, you\u2019re going to cause an infection and you\u2019re going to cause death. And this was actually a major cause of death throughout most of history. So through a similar lens, if we\u2019re trying to build socioeconomic systems using a money that\u2019s contaminated with the uncertainty of inflation or confiscation or de-authorization, it tends to make me believe that the system that we would build would be more vulnerable to death as well! And I think that a quick study of history will show you that typically the debasement of money tends to presage the collapse of the civilization. So when the money becomes extra contaminated, this tends to be a specter or a harbinger of its ultimate demise. So I love this analogy! And it really gets into the entropy aspect again. We just consider that entropy is uncertainty. [1:07:35] We want medical instruments that are free from the uncertainty of microbial infection. We want economic instruments that are free from the uncertainty of inflation and de-authorization and confiscation. Like, it just makes sense. The more certainty we can add to our tool set whether in the medical or the economic domain, the more longevity we can give the organism or the organization, right? It just makes sense. And as Saylor said earlier, Monetary energy being the highest form of energy that humans can channel, and channeling energy across space and time being the highest aim of man, that effectively monetary energy is life energy! It gives us a claim on all other forms of energy. So we can think of encryption actually \u2014 I think Saylor Tweeted this at some point \u2014 that the destiny of all money is to be encrypted. We can think of encryption itself as a sterilization function or process for money. We\u2019ve actually disinfected the money by encrypting its rules and its supply. That hearkens back to consumer packaged goods, when we\u2019re able to vacuum seal foods and store food energy in a stable fashion at room temperature \u2014 that was a game changer! All of a sudden we had this abundance of economic surplus in food energy that we could distribute around the world, and this led to a surge in population growth. So all these analogies pointing back to this breakthrough that is Bitcoin that again we\u2019ve been building on in earlier episodes I just found to be super-exciting! And then in that lens, Saylor also talked about the story of his mother being diabetic. And the connection I made there was that she was essentially following a governmental food advisory, just eating the typical food pyramid that governments \u2014 at least the US government \u2014 used to advise, which had carbs as the staple, the big thing at the bottom: bread, pasta, etc., and worked its way up. Whereas in fact, anyone that studied ketogenics and the paleodiets and whatnot, it tends to actually be the opposite: you want low-carb, high-fat or high protein diets. And it\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s not one size fits all, but a lot of diseases we suffer from today like diabetes is from excessive carb consumption. So the connection I made there was that this government food pyramid scheme or mistake \u2014 whatever you want to call it, whether the intention was good or bad \u2014 it\u2019s actually rooted in the government fiat currency pyramid scheme, where we have contaminated the money. So we\u2019ve contaminated even the ideologies we put out in terms of nutrition, and it just has these cascading effects. Inflation is not just contaminating our economic efforts, but it actually bleeds over into the biological domain. So as Saylor said, Fiat currency is toxic money. It\u2019s just not sound. It is not entropy-free. It\u2019s infected with entropy, and this has all these second-order effects with everything that it touches. [1:11:10] And the main problem is this misunderstanding about inflation. We have this whole economic sphere today focused on CPI as inflation. But it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. There\u2019s deeper reasons why if you read a book like Human Action by Mises that you can can never have an index for inflation, because, sort of like value itself or beauty, it\u2019s subjective, right? It\u2019s based on the things that you individually desire, based on the course of your own goal-directed action, so there\u2019s not a universal index that can fit everyone. Your own inflation number is a basket of these goods that you\u2019re seeking. And the government metric is just taking what they assume to be things that are desirable, but exclude assets. So it\u2019s like they\u2019re excluding the fact that anyone wants to get wealthy, which is absurd. Also excluding food and energy and other volatile assets. Volatile meaning they changed in price! We\u2019re talking about a metric that is intended to reflect price changes excluding things that changed in price. It is a non-starter, it\u2019s absolutely crazy! And this is still the benchmark number that so many people are focused on and it\u2019s just amazing to me that it still goes on. And the discussion flowed into understanding inflation, which for me I think this makes more sense which is: If you think about it in rate of change terms, as in how many Dollars are being produced? The growth in Dollar production relative to the growth in good or service production. If you pace a fiat currency production that\u2019s outpacing the productivity gains or the output on a particular good or service, it\u2019s going to inflate in price because you\u2019re going to have more dollars chasing the same or only slightly growing goods or services. So another way to say that is: How energy-intensive is the good? The example that I like to think about is ribeye steak. We\u2019re not gonna invent a technological breakthrough that makes cows grow faster. It still requires the same amount of sunlight and energy and time and processing to deliver a ribeye steak, and it turns out historically that actually the purchasing power of gold maps pretty nicely to ribeye steak, or cows more generally. [1:13:48] So in that way inflation is not a single universal phenomenon that we can peg to one index number. It\u2019s occurring differently for every asset and every person in every place at every time. It\u2019s just this undulating sphere of changing economic values. You can\u2019t possibly just put a number to it and say that is inflation. Another way to say that is it\u2019s just uneven across space and time. So you\u2019re dumping new money supply into the system, that money itself is distributed unevenly, and then the aims of economic actors are shifting unevenly as well, supply and demand. So it\u2019s just hubris to think that we could peg it all to one index number! To that point, Saylor makes a more sound argument that a more appropriate measure of inflation \u2014 knowing that we can\u2019t peg it to a number \u2014 but what we can do is say, What are things that people generally desire, and how much are their prices changing year over year? He gave the example earlier of retirement, premier real estate, things like this \u2014 things that people actually want in life! You don\u2019t go to work to think, I just want to put food on the table for the rest of my life. At some point you\u2019d like to work towards an aim or a goal whether that\u2019s a nice home, living in a nice neighborhood, possibly I love the example of early retirement where you can just buy a government bond that pays you a \u201crisk-free\u201d rate for the next 30 years, and looking at the price of government bonds and how much that\u2019s jumped based on monetary policy. So I thought that was just a great example. It\u2019s interesting because when you really get to first principles on it, fiat currency inflation as we define it is just an arbitrary increase in the money supply that adds no economic value to an economy whatsoever. It\u2019s very important to understand that by \u201cprinting money\u201d, you\u2019re not infusing an economy with any new factors of production, whether this is human time, ingenuity, tools to put in factories, there\u2019s nothing being added to the economy. You\u2019ve just reshuffled the paper claims on those productive factors. You\u2019ve taken away from those relying on fiat currency or the Dollar as a store of value. You\u2019ve reallocated those claims to whoever can get their hands on the new printed money first and spend it first. So it is a mechanism for theft. I don\u2019t know what else to call it, frankly. It only has one purpose. You can argue about the intentionality \u2014 whatever. I\u2019m not going to debate that. I can just tell you that the tool, fiat currency \u2014 the inflation of fiat currency \u2014 has only one purpose: To reallocate wealth from some and allocate to others against their will. So I don\u2019t know what else you could call it really besides theft. And it seems to me like this Keynesian ideology feels like a coverup! I don\u2019t if they just believe what they\u2019re saying about inflation. Saylor was arguing that they bled George Washington to death and they thought that was the best course of action \u2014 maybe that is the case! Maybe Keynesian economics are so deeply steeped in this ideology that they just can\u2019t see their own hand in front of their face so to speak. Or perhaps it\u2019s something more nefarious, more of a propaganda stick thing. But regardless, I love the point that \u2014 he tied this into an old German propaganda machine. He said: The studies show them that they can\u2019t tell people what to think, but they can tell people what to think about. And it is amazing to me how many sophisticated investors I\u2019ve talked to about Bitcoin and macroeconomics over the years, and people are just anchored to CPI as inflation. It\u2019s as if this wool has just been pulled over their eyes, that they are satisfied with the answer presented to them versus thinking more deeply about it. And I can\u2019t help think it\u2019s related to this, right? It\u2019s pushed as the representation of inflation and people just accept it at face value, which is just a really bad deal all the way around. [1:18:37] So we got into a bit of discussion about interest rates, and his analogy of actually suppressing interest rates is freezing out market participants or sucking the air out of the room. If you consider that the interest rate is the price of money, money is this tool for trading time and energy, we could consider that the interest rate is the price of time or energy, effectively. And when you try and suppress it, you\u2019re fighting against the natural flow of time, if you will. It\u2019s this misguided attempt to try and mute entropy that causes \u2014 Taleb would call this an iatrogenic effect. So it\u2019s harm caused by the healer. When someone overmedicates \u2014 again back to George Washington \u2014 they thought they were helping George Washington by bleeding him, but they were actually hurting him. They actually killed him by doing that. You know, many doctors today will prescribe you a pill for your cholesterol or your anxiety or whatever it may be. Whereas in fact the right treatment of the core problem \u2014 not just a drug to cover up the symptoms \u2014 could be something more like removal. Elimination of certain foods from your diet or fasting or whatever it may be. And this to me, it points towards what central banks ostensibly at least have been trying to do, is that their explicit aim is price stability and low unemployment. So price stability, you\u2019re saying that you want supply and demand worldwide to be like consistently close enough to keep prices stable. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense. You\u2019re arguing against the entropy of nature again. And when you try and artificially inflate the money supply to create this veneer of stability, you\u2019re actually just delaying \u2014 first of all you\u2019re manipulating market prices \u2014 supply and demand, buyers and sellers, are having trouble getting matched up correctly, which is what the market does because of this distortion in the marketplace. But you\u2019re also delaying and exacerbating the ultimate correction, because you can\u2019t fool economic reality. In that way I see \u2014 the vision I have in mind \u2014 is central banking is kind of like an air conditioner. An air conditioner is a heat pump, so it\u2019s pulling entropy out of the room. It\u2019s not actually putting cold air into the room, it\u2019s pulling hot air out of the room, or heat energy out of the room. And if you\u2019ve ever stood behind an air conditioner, you\u2019ll feel it! You\u2019ll feel the heat coming off of it that it\u2019s pumping out of that room that it\u2019s air conditioning. And it seems like a central bank is trying to accomplish that in a way, it\u2019s trying to paper over the entropy, the natural entropy of price stability and unemployment. But in doing so it\u2019s pumping out \u2014 it\u2019s creating certainty for its shareholders, let\u2019s say , so it\u2019s decreasing entropy for its shareholders\u2014but it\u2019s pumping out entropy onto broader society in the form of price distortions, an exacerbated boom and bust business cycle, and you could even throw warfare in there! Central banks were originally set up to fund warfare, to give governments a virtual limitless mechanism for funding the war. Where instead of just needing to rely on their own savings they could just print money and siphon savings off the entire productive economy. So that\u2019s my central banking air conditioning analogy, that it\u2019s trying to cool the room for its shareholders but it\u2019s pumping heat onto broader society and it\u2019s just disastrous. [1:22:52] So we got into the relationship between inflation rates and the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate would be yield on government bonds. So in finance we say that \u2014 and this is a \u201crisk-free\u201d rate \u2014 that the US government for instance cannot default on its debt because it can always just print more money to pay its principle. What that actually means is that it can never default on its debt because it can externalize the cost of that debt onto society via inflation. So that\u2019s your risk-free rate, whatever the US 10 or 30-year treasury is yielding. And then there\u2019s the inflation rate \u2014 again not CPI \u2014 our proxy is how quickly is the US M2 increasing on a percentage basis. And the delta between these two is a negative real yield! If I can only get 2% on US treasuries \u2014 it\u2019s lower than that today \u2014 but US M2 is growing at 15% year over year, it\u2019s expected to do that over the next few years, then I\u2019ve got a negative real yield of of -13%! So unless I\u2019m growing my business or my own personal cash flows by more than 13% year over year, then I\u2019m being diluted! I\u2019m losing money! So this is the hurdle rate, basically, to use another investment term. You need to at least exceed the delta between inflation and the risk-free rate to even be accretive to your business or your household, whatever it may be. So the only way to do this is you need to buy an equity \u2014 and a lot of people are doing this \u2014 they\u2019re buying equities as a store of value that is expected to appreciate faster than that negative real yield. A lot of this is in tech because tech has just a ton of productivity gains associated with it, and it had a great decade so there start to be market actor expectations built into the price, where if you look at the P/E ratio of something like Zoom or even Tesla or Facebook, they\u2019re astronomically high relative to historic averages! Another way to think about that is: There\u2019s nowhere to store your value that\u2019s safe except these equities that are expected to grow and outpace the hurdle rate and remain relatively scarce. So that leaves with these bonds that are yielding less than the inflation rate, they\u2019re long-term dilutive, and then those negative real yields, that\u2019s driving and incentivizing people to buy scarce assets. Again: equities, real estate, gold, and then this is also the bucket you put Bitcoin\u2019s value prop in, is that it\u2019s the scarcest liquid asset in human history, so of course it\u2019s gonna benefit from this centrally planned market manipulation in both the bond and the fiat currency markets. And we talked a bit about this, just one way to strip out central banking market manipulation and get an honest assessment of what\u2019s going on, is to just price the index in gold or Bitcoin \u2014 again Bitcoin\u2019s a bit more noisy because it\u2019s emergent \u2014 gold has a much longer history. Or to Saylor\u2019s point you could also price it in the change in money supply. And this will strip out a lot of the manipulation. So if you look at the past decade in the S&P, it\u2019s been one long bull market \u2014 you price that same chart in gold, it\u2019s flat. There hasn\u2019t been a lot. So that\u2019s I think really important as far as changing your economic frame of reference, which is what\u2019s so tricky about talking about these things, about like What is Money? [1:26:51] Because it\u2019s an a priori perception. An a priori means \u201cno priors.\u201d You\u2019re looking at what is looking, so to speak. And people just \u2014 the a priori economic way in which we\u2019re in today is Dollars for most people: this is what they think in, that\u2019s what they trade in and negotiate in. But you have to look at the dilution occurring in that frame of reference, which is the Dollar. So it\u2019s a bit of a meta-thinking, but it\u2019s really important for coming to sound economic conclusions and calculations. Then we got into the competition and the law of decimation. Saylor made the point that, Even if you\u2019re smarter than 99% \u2014 say you are one of the top 0.1% most intelligent people in the world, you were smarter than 99.99% of humanity, there are still on this planet 750,000 people smarter than you! That was just crazy to me to think of it that way. And in the digital age, I think what we\u2019re entering into is this Age of Excellency almost where because the bounds of location have been lifted through digital tools and technologies, it\u2019s no longer good enough to just be the best local guy at whatever it is \u2014 singing, for instance. Maybe you\u2019re a Billy Joel impersonator or something. It\u2019s no longer a good career strategy to just be the best Billy Joel impersonator in your neighborhood. Because people have YouTube now! They can go and look at the best Billy Joel impersonator of all time, or maybe even Billy Joel himself, and they can seek their entertainment there. So you start competing for audience with the best of the best in any domain that can be conducted remotely, which increasingly is every domain. So this means that excellency is gonna have more of a tendency to rise to the surface, and that markets more typically are gonna converge on winner-take-all dynamics. It changes things a lot! This non-locality or not being bound by geography really changes the game a lot in a lot of ways. So Saylor\u2019s point was: You\u2019ve got to focus your energies to compete well on your speciality \u2014 whatever that is, whatever skillset or unique ability you have, whatever gift you might have \u2014 and you\u2019ve got to stay humble, and you really have to focus on that, developing it to the best of your ability, but also maintain the humility I think necessary to succeed and learn and grow. [1:29:44] Any time \u2014 as he was describing his experiences at Microstrategy, it\u2019s ferociously competitive! \u2014 any time you become arrogant or comfortable or resting on your laurels, 1 of those 750,000 are just gonna eat you up! They could go out, raise a bunch of money, they want what you have by definition if you\u2019re successful. If anything, digital tech has made the world more fiercely competitive, which I thought was really interesting. As far as the law of decimation, we brought up the point that in Ancient Rome, the law of decimation was: Any time the soldiers broke ranks or retreated, 10% of them would randomly be put to death, and they would make the other 9 put the 10th to death. And what this was was a massive disincentive to malperformance. Everyone had a big incentive to hold the line so to speak, and to act in a concerted effort, because if they didn\u2019t, if they got fearful or started operating in their own individual best interest in a battle, when you need the collective effort of the battalion to win, then they\u2019re engaging in this lottery where either they\u2019re gonna be put to death or at least 1 in 10 of their friends is gonna be put to death. A really good system for inducing skin in the game. And it turns out that this is\u2014again getting back to the natural law \u2014 it\u2019s sort of a reflection of what we observe in nature, in that 1 in 10 of any system with 10 moving parts, 1 is gonna break down over a year, roughly. A 10% breakdown in parts or features per year! I observe that as just being \u2014again we\u2019re creating these systems that are intended to confront the entropy of nature and deal with it in certain ways \u2014 well that has a cost, right? And every year, by some universal magic that number tends to be about 10%. And this pointed back to steel: as Saylor referred to, Steel will last forever if you maintain it! So you need to expend the 10% per year painting it to maintain it. Maybe this is also related to the religious tithing which we see as a 10% contribution annually to the institution \u2014 and that\u2019s across a number of religions. And I think this too points to a strength of Bitcoin, is that it actually has minimized moving parts. And it\u2019s open source so anything that does break down, there\u2019s as many eyes on it as possible to repair it. But it minimizes its \u2014 say in comparison to Ethereum that just has countless moving parts \u2014 it\u2019s gonna suffer more from this law of decimation over time than something like Bitcoin will, which optimizes for survivability. Finally we got into the philosophy of Stoicism. And this is a philosophy which ties back into everything that we\u2019ve been talking about: It\u2019s consistent with thermodynamics. So again if we\u2019re just saying it in a purely physics sense, Truth is an accurate portrayal of reality. We know that everything in the universe is energy. So therefore conservation of energy \u2014 which is the first law of thermodynamics \u2014 that is truthfulness! So the systems, the strategies, the techniques, the businesses, the individuals that optimize for energy conservation \u2014 this doesn\u2019t just mean defending all of the energy you have, you can actually increase energy efficiency through innovation. So being exploratory, figuring out a new way of doing things can actually add to your energy efficiency as well. So there\u2019s this ratcheting effect between defending what you\u2019ve gained and gaining new innovation. So Stoicism is this thermodynamic philosophy if you will, which I think is so cool, that it\u2019s a way that many of the ancients accorded their behavior, and it directly maps onto innovation and general biological success. So the Stoic \u2014 again we had this law of decimation, we had these systems encountering the chaos of nature, there\u2019s a little bit of breakdown over time \u2014 the Stoic embraces that! The Stoic knows and willingly embraces death, the potential death of your child, the potential loss of your business or your fortune. There are all these practices when you get into Stoicism like negative visualization, where you may imagine for instance the next time you hug your mother, you just imagine that that may be the last time that you ever hug her. And through that mental practice you\u2019re actually training yourself to be more grateful for something in the moment, and you\u2019re preparing yourself for the inevitable loss that will come, right? Your mother will be gone one day. So Stoicism is a deep rabbit hole in an unto itself. And I\u2019ll just leave it at one example. I just thought it was really cool that Stoics embrace entropy and choose to accept it and strive on valiantly nonetheless. And I think that\u2019s the only proper approach to life if you\u2019re gonna be successful. Saylor went into a paradox of Marcus Aurelius which I had ever heard before \u2014 I\u2019m a big fan of Marcus. Marcus was this great philosopher king, great writer, but in the end, sort of blew it on one decision. And Saylor\u2019s point here was, Words don\u2019t matter, actions do, ultimately. And even one action can undo a lifetime of good action. This reminded me of Taleb\u2019s, Don\u2019t tell me what you think, just show me what\u2019s in your portfolio. It\u2019s more about what actions you take with skin in the game versus your cognitive beliefs. And for me personally I tied this back to religion actually is that, people always want to argue, Do you believe in God? Do you not believe in God? I love Jordan Peterson\u2019s answer to this: I act as if God exists! God doesn\u2019t care about my cognitive beliefs, it\u2019s more about my embodied action and my moral behavior that really matters in the world. So it\u2019s a bit of an Occam\u2019s Razor thing there. But anyways, the story of Marcus is, he had the keys to the kingdom. One of the most successful emperors of all time, he was the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king, and on his final decision essentially as emperor of Rome, decided to break duty, break with tradition, break with the Stoic protocol if you will of appointing the most competent man for the job for succession, and instead appointed Commodus, which was his son. And there\u2019s something really deep here. There\u2019s this age-old struggle between duty and love. I don\u2019t know\u2014this one left me thinking! So I\u2019d be excited to hear some of your guys\u2019 feedback on this. But it\u2019s really fascinating to me that we had this guy we\u2019d held in such high regard and then at the last yard-line so to speak he just fumbled the ball! But I don\u2019t know if this was based on love for his son or something else, but it\u2019d be really interesting, right? If he made this decision out of love so to speak, yet it still proved to be wrong decision for civilization. Just a mind-bending thing, but I thought it was super interesting. And the warning there is: You can live a good life, you can be a good leader, a good writer, whatever, but you have to always remain humble and never become arrogant no matter how much success you\u2019ve had because there\u2019s always that opportunity to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as Saylor put it, which I thought was brilliant. Then finally we completed the episode with a discussion of antifragility and vitality. And I love this point that animals in the wild are all beautiful because they\u2019re constantly being conditioned against the chaos of nature! Once they went past the tipping point of misfitness they\u2019re no longer serving their highest and best function in the world, something else eats them. They\u2019re gone. So it\u2019s nature rolling forward and becoming better through this process, this dynamic equilibrium between predator and prey, and it\u2019s this Darwinian natural selection that\u2019s constantly promulgating excellence and beauty in the world. And it\u2019s great to behold! If you\u2019ve ever watched a nature documentary it\u2019s one of the most awe-inspiring things I think that we can watch! So another way to think about this is just nature constantly sharpening her own strategies against herself. So the strategies of animals \u2014 the survival strategies \u2014 are constantly being tested against the environment. And those that succeed roll forward and those that do not are weeded out and so you\u2019re left with by definition the most fit creature for its environment. When we try and disturb that dynamic equilibrium we\u2019re just exacerbating that correction. Instead of having these little corrections along the way, we\u2019re giving time for the strategy and the environment to diverge significantly to where an ultimate cataclysmic return is necessary. That\u2019s what nature does! It always selects and it always restores balance. So all of that tying back into \u2014 again when I think that central banking is just a failure of an institution because it\u2019s tried to over-engineer this dynamic equilibrium of nature where we have price instability and unemployment as a natural product of the business cycle, it\u2019s trying to paper over that, it\u2019s trying to eliminate this dynamic equilibrium and create something that\u2019s predictable. It\u2019s trying to subdue the entropy of nature if you will, which could be a good intention but clearly has a poor result, which leads to suppressed interest rates which is like trying to reverse the flow of time. So it\u2019s all of this effort going countervailing to nature that always fails! That\u2019s the core point here. It turns nature into a zoo! Right? We said that every animal is beautiful, but if you really want to see some not-beautiful animals you can actually go to a zoo. They\u2019re sad, they\u2019re in a cage, they\u2019re not fulfilling the function for which they were evolved, and I think central banking sort of turns society into a zoo. It softens us \u2014 in this process of trying to \u201cprotect us\u201d from price instability and unemployment, it\u2019s actually reducing our skin in the game, softening us, externalizing entropy onto society. So yeah! Just another awesome episode. Hope you guys enjoyed this. Saylor and I are gonna do at least 1 more episode, maybe more after that, we\u2019re gonna see how it goes. But I hope you enjoyed this one as much as I did, and I\u2019ll see you here again soon! Thanks!"}

Welcome back to Episode 8 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! Today we\u2019re gonna talk about a number of interesting concepts getting even deeper into Bitcoin theory and how it has effects on the future of humanity. So if you haven\u2019t seen Episodes 1\u20137, I highly recommend you check those out. A lot of the material we built upon there, it\u2019s compounding as we get deeper into Bitcoin theory. So today we\u2019re gonna talk about a number of things. Firstly is the divinity of engineering, actually, and how this creative impulse is sort of what defines Man and fulfills Man. We\u2019re also gonna look at Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and talk about why Saylor thinks it\u2019s actually a low frequency medium of exchange and a high frequency store of value. We\u2019ll also learn why it\u2019s a pretty bad idea to compensate people with Bitcoin. It turns out the tax codes are pretty hostile to that at the current time. We\u2019ll also look at another monetary function of Bitcoin, and that\u2019s as a unit of account. We\u2019re gonna look at Bitcoin too in a macro context: How it sits as an asset class adjacent to other asset classes. We\u2019re also gonna do a deep dive into crypto versus digital networks. This is a delineation that Saylor makes to distinguish decentralized crypto networks versus centralized digital networks. And we\u2019ll talk about the trade-offs between the two. Then we\u2019re gonna get into the really interesting topic of immortal sovereignty, which is something that crypto networks enable and actually allow us to project our preferences beyond our own life. I think that\u2019s a really interesting part of the conversation. We\u2019re gonna revisit money as power, we\u2019re gonna talk about advanced technology as magic, and we\u2019re gonna see what the two of those look like when they come together. And then finally we\u2019ll discuss Bitcoin as a pure and principled ideology, which is something somewhat unique in the modern age. So this is another big episode! I hope you guys have seen 1\u20137. If not, again, go check those out now. And with that, let\u2019s jump in!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-8-oZhkfOHyBj-/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 8 | Bitcoin and Immortal Sovereignty", "text": "Robert Breedlove [05:49]: I\u2019m gonna bring up one more point on the religious aspect of Bitcoin that I\u2019ve thought about. My religious tradition too was Southern Baptist \u2014 I was raised Southern Baptist \u2014 so I have Judeo-Christian underpinning in my thought. But the ancient idea in Genesis was that God was the force that confronts chaos with courage, truth, love, and converts that chaos into good, inhabitable order. So when we look at that through a thermodynamic lens, we know that the whole universe is everywhere and always trending towards increasing chaos and entropy, and that the only thing that works against that thermodynamic arrow of time is life, actually! Life converts entropy into order. So in a way we could say that life or even the God-aspect of life is the anti-entropic principle that propagates through all of life. And I can\u2019t help but relate that and see Bitcoin in that lens, too, where we do have this system that\u2019s actually reaching deeper into chaos than anything else. The SHA-256 mining algorithm is quite literally finding a single atom in an entire universe \u2014 that is the mining race, if you will, is identifying the single atom in the universe \u2014 and with that reach into chaos it is forging the most profound order we\u2019ve ever had! You can\u2019t argue with the Bitcoin blockchain. Whoever has those UTXOs has them! So it seems to me like there is a profound connection between truth and this principle of converting chaos into order, and the quote that took that home for me with G. K. Chesterton was, A dead thing can go with the stream, only a living thing can swim against it. So Bitcoin in that sense is quite literally alive!"}

The beaver is engineering the stream to create a dam, human beings are engineering systems. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary energy system. It\u2019s the first well-engineered monetary system that we\u2019ve built. Human beings through their intellect channel that energy, and within the [Bitcoin] system we extract order and we have a very efficient structure, and the price we pay is some disorder outside of our system. Some energy dissipation. But I\u2019m not terribly concerned with that. The universe has got more energy than it needs and we\u2019re just dipping our fingers into 0.000 \u2014 with a million kazillion 0\u2019s after it \u2014 0001%, right? So it can spare a little bit of energy! And when we create something beautiful \u2014 be it a railroad or Bitcoin network or social network or the like \u2014 we find a way to do something millions of times faster, smarter, stronger than before, and that drives forward the human race. So this is not the only great achievement of the human race, it just happens to be the most interesting achievement of the human race!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-8-oZhkfOHyBj-/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 8 | Bitcoin and Immortal Sovereignty", "text": "Michael Saylor [11:08]: You know, a lot of people, they focus upon the whitepaper and we debate it ad infinitum and I think that everybody that we agree with notes that peer-to-peer cash means a settlement network for a bearer instrument. And it\u2019s important that, in that regard, you be able to exchange assets. It\u2019s, in my opinion, utterly unimportant that you be able to engage in high frequency small transactions on the Bitcoin network. And I think that it\u2019s dysfunctional to pursue that vision. I think that Roger Ver is just wrong! I mean it was a nice idea. Roger Ver thinks the magic in Bitcoin is to be able to pay for coffee with your phone. And it\u2019s a tragic error of insight \u2014 that was not the magic of Bitcoin then and it isn\u2019t now! The magic of Bitcoin is being able to catapult energy 100 years into the future and not lose the energy. And then the other magics are the magics that come from wrapping the Bitcoin with software to make it smarter, faster, and the stronger \u2014 that\u2019s the magic! The ability to do a minor transaction, it\u2019s trivially inconsequential. Number one, only 1\u20132% of your wealth needs to be in these high frequency transactions. So a logical thing for anybody is just to keep 1, 2, 3% of their wealth in fiat. And then operate it on the Paypal network or the Visa network or the Apple Pay network or some centralized network. I think Saifedean\u2019s already made the point: A proof of work network is a billion times or a trillion times less efficient than the centralized version. So you\u2019re gonna get a billion times more speed and a billion times more economy by running the 1% of your life on a centralized network. And if you didn\u2019t need to move it to off-chain \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a crypto, I just think off-chain\u2019s just a centralized network! You might as well just put it on Square or Apple, because nobody cares whether they go out of business in a year, 2 years or 5 years. And if you\u2019re in a country, the fact that those transactions are being monitored just means that, well, 1% of the value of your transactions are being monitored! If you want to do something illicit, you would do it 0.01% of the time on the Bitcoin network! So the one time in your life when you need to flee Iraq or Syria as a refugee, and that\u2019s when you need to do your on-chain transaction, well then you use Bitcoin and you can wait 30 minutes \u2014 you\u2019ll probably be okay. By definition: If you move $1 Billion once, it\u2019s a billion times more valuable than moving $1 once. And so the use case of moving $1 Billion back and forth is valuable, and you can pay high transaction fees. And the use case of moving $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, or $50 or $100 is not valuable, because it falls exponentially or at least linearly with the amount of money being moved. Now there\u2019s some other reasons why Bitcoin doesn\u2019t make sense as a medium of exchange right now. And maybe never! I tend to think never. I think what\u2019s gonna happen is \u2014 well we can debate semantics about what medium of exchange means \u2014 but I think Bitcoin is a high frequency store of value, low frequency settlement network. Or low frequency medium of exchange. Once a month is more than enough! Once a year? Maybe enough! Once in a lifetime? Might be enough! If the rest of the ecosystem develops, there will be a point at which there\u2019s a crypto bank and Robert Breedlove has 200 Bitcoin in the account and he points the bank toward the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin\u2019s worth $1 Million a Bitcoin and the bank will forward you fiat on credit at good rates to do whatever you want your entire life \u2014 the Bitcoin will never move. And the bank will do whatever, and if the bank fails, what do you care? The bank failed, not you. It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ve got 1%, you\u2019ve got nothing at risk, they actually took all the risk! So you don\u2019t need to do things with a high frequency to create value other than protect the money. Now there are some accounting and systems and tax reasons why it doesn\u2019t make sense as a medium of exchange. The obvious thing is: Every time you actually take revenue in Bitcoin, it would be a taxable event. You would mark the Bitcoin. So if you paid me in Bitcoin while Bitcoin is trading at $10,500, I have to mark it. You pay me $27 in Bitcoin, I have a ledger entry: $27 of Bitcoin with $10,400 basis. If your friend bought another $32 book, I have another ledger entry! If I sold a million things in Bitcoin, I\u2019d have a million ledger entries with a million different basis prices. And then if I paid you a salary in Bitcoin, I would then have to figure out capital gain on it, and then I\u2019d have to pay the tax. So if I have $100 Million in Bitcoin and then next year I pay $100 Million in expenses in Bitcoin and Bitcoin went up by a factor of 2, I would actually generate $100 Million in capital gains and I would owe $20-$30 Million to the federal government within 12 months for the privilege of running Bitcoin, which runs a billion times slower than Apple Pay! So how many ways is this awful? Well first of all, it takes a decade to get your accounting systems to work. It\u2019s worthwhile to note: How does a global multinational work? I have 27 subsidiaries in 27 countries. I do business in about 10\u201315 different currencies: US, Euro, Yuan, Yen, Pesos, Real, Mexican Peso, Argentine Peso \u2014 you name it! We\u2019ve got lots of currencies! By law we do that. By law we pay all the medical bills in those currencies, all the insurance, all the vendor relationships \u2014 took 10 years. It takes 10 years to set up a global multinational from start to finish! [18:17] It probably takes 5 years to get all your accounting systems to work right, $20, $30, $40 Million to get it all working right. If I buy $500 Million in Bitcoin, I put it in the treasury, I stare at it, I never do another transaction hopefully for the next decade. Until we\u2019re in an insolvency event, we\u2019re not moving it, right? Why would we? The truth is, we want to put it in the vault and throw away the key! Like, I would say to anybody, I don\u2019t want to be able to move it! I just want it to sit there! I\u2019m gonna wait for it to appreciate. Then we sell stuff in Yuan and Yen and Euro and Dollar, and we put that into our accounts. We sweep all the fiat into maybe one currency, into one thing: Dollar. We balance, and if we need to shuffle some stuff around in working capital accounts we put it back. If we don\u2019t need it for working capital we sweep it into the treasury. If it\u2019s in the treasury, we convert it to the treasury reserve asset \u2014 Bitcoin! It goes in, never comes out! You know, a vendor wants \u2014 they send me a bill, I pay them in a local currency. No vendor\u2019s gonna bill me in Bitcoin. People say \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this \u2014 Well, don\u2019t your employees want to get paid in Bitcoin? Well the answer is, No, they don\u2019t! But let\u2019s say the answer was, Yes. Let\u2019s say all of them were Bitcoin maximalists. Exactly how much Bitcoin do they want to get paid in? They have mortgages. They have bills. So the answer is, We pay them in the local currency, and if they want to buy Bitcoin, or if they want Bitcoin, they buy it! Why would it be an awful mistake to pay them in Bitcoin? Because we would accelerate the tax bill by 100 years. And as Bitcoin is volatile, we will generate all sorts of tax obligations. The second thing is, we would increase our accounting complexity by an order of magnitude. And the third is, our employees will then have to sell the Bitcoin and generate their own taxable accounting complexity in order to get cash to pay their mortgage and pay for their kids\u2019 school or whatever they\u2019re doing, right? So you\u2019re creating lots of complexity here. If I\u2019ve got 2,000 employees and 200 of \u2018em want to own Bitcoin then I pay all 2,000 in Euros and Dollars and Pesos and Yen and Yuan and they go on their local exchange and they buy the Bitcoin and they HODL it! Because like, Do I want to HODL it? So the point is, when you\u2019re running a company with Bitcoin as an operating system, the logical thing to do is you just sweep your fiat into your treasury, convert your treasury into Bitcoin, let it sit there, and then let every \u2014 if a vendor wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! If an employee wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! The whole ethos of Bitcoin is: Take responsibility for yourself! Don\u2019t treat adults like children. So it\u2019s patronizing in a way for me to say, Well Robert you work for me, but I\u2019m gonna help you by paying you in Bitcoin! It\u2019s like, You\u2019re a smart enough person \u2014 if you want to buy Bitcoin with it, here\u2019s the money. Buy Bitcoin with it \u2014 have at it! It\u2019s what you do. The money has a constant value at the time I\u2019ve transferred it from me to you, and the thing that really cripples a cryptocurrency and a thing like Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the tax treatment that the local regulatory domain makes. At the point that the United States IRS decided that this was going to be taxed as a capital gain on the moment of sale, it was utterly impossible for it to be a currency. It\u2019s just that simple. It\u2019s done. For anybody to even maintain it \u2014 the only way you could think that you could use it as currency is if you\u2019re gonna run a black market, grey market operation with no accounting, no accountants, no lawyers on staff. And it\u2019s like, Good luck with that! I mean, how many discos and bars got shut down for sales tax or income tax evasion, right? What was it, like \u2014 most of them! Small businesses, they\u2019re eventually going to all run afoul of the regulators and get shut down. So it\u2019s just not practical from a systems point of view. It would take me a decade to rewire the systems. It\u2019s not practical from a complexity point of view. You\u2019ve just made your accounting a hundred times as complex. And it\u2019s not practical from a tax point of view. [23:38] You\u2019ve just tripled the tax rate. And it\u2019s not practical from a whatever employee point of view because it\u2019s making everybody else\u2019s life more complicated too. So that\u2019s why I think that Bitcoin really isn\u2019t a medium of exchange as much as it is just a low frequency settlement network. I\u2019ll make one more point, this is back to via negativa: The fact that you could settle peer-to-peer means that you might not have to for 100 years! The fact that I say to you, Robert you do as I say, or else! \u2014 if you have the ability to leave the country and depart with all of your wealth and I know you have the ability \u2014 right? Robert Heinlein has a phrase, An armed society is a polite society. I live in Miami Beach. Sometimes I run around, and people have guns in Miami. You can carry concealed carry permit, right? A young debutante that looks harmless could be walking around with a gun in her purse, and you think twice when it\u2019s 2 in the morning and you\u2019re in a bar and everybody\u2019s drunk, before you\u2019re pushy or rude. And then you think, Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be in a bar at 2 in the morning when people are drunk! And then you think, Maybe I shouldn\u2019t mouth off to someone that just cut me off on the highway. Somebody pulls over and they shoot you dead! And you think, I just oughta be very polite to everybody walking down the street, because every single person could have a gun concealed on their person. And maybe I\u2019ll be nice to people today! It\u2019s a deterrent, right? So the ability to cash settle, or the ability to settle and exchange, that\u2019s the deterrent. Because the fact that I know you could means that I\u2019m gonna treat you with respect! If I knew you couldn\u2019t, if I thought that you were trapped \u2014 if you were stuck in my monopoly and I had total power over you\u2014then I start to take you for granted. And then I start to abuse that power. Because as Lord Acton said, Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So the power to do a thing is more important than the doing of the thing. And that\u2019s what the Bitcoin Cash guys, they miss. They miss the fact that: If I can move all the money when I need to, then I won\u2019t need to! And so yeah I need to be able to move it so it will hold $100 Trillion in value, but no I don\u2019t need to move it now! And maybe I don\u2019t need to move it more than once, ever, just to make an example. It\u2019s like nuclear deterrence. I use it once, maybe I used it twice \u2014 I haven\u2019t used it since. But do you think that doesn\u2019t \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not effective? You think it doesn\u2019t matter to have it?"}

And this gets back to the difference between a free market and a monopoly. In a free market, you know that your customers have options. They can go to other providers, they could settle elsewhere, they could move their capital out. And because they have that optionality, you as the producer or provider are accountable to their preferences. You have to listen to the customer. You have to listen to their wishes and desires and make sure you\u2019re satisfying their wants. Whereas on the other end of that spectrum is the monopolist that, to your point, he just doesn\u2019t care about the preferences of his customer because his customers have no choice! They\u2019re stuck in his little fiefdom. I mean it\u2019s the difference between an economic democracy and an economic dictatorship. So the fact that Bitcoin is just totally movable anywhere, anytime and you can\u2019t put the gate around it and monopolize it is what makes it such a game-changer!"}

It\u2019s just not worth doing. And given the fact that it\u2019s a million times more expensive from a tax point of view, and given the fact that it\u2019s a billion times more expensive from a computing power point of view, the only reason to want to do it is regulatory arbitrage, i.e. grey market, black market operation. Not a very profitable pursuit of human ingenuity! You know, you ask Meyer Lansky, What\u2019d you learn in all your years as a gangster? He said, It was so hard I realized if I\u2019d have to do it again I just would\u2019ve gone straight! It\u2019s a lot easier to make money just being legitimate, so inventing some kind of technology to evade the regulators explicitly? It\u2019s like, they might let you invent something that will carry energy 100 years forward, because it seems like something that legitimate law-abiding citizens might want to do. They\u2019re not gonna let you invent something that allows you to evade taxes, and so: Why try so hard? It\u2019s just not worth the trouble! I\u2019m reminded of the stories of Pablo Escobar, and he made the billions of dollars selling all the drugs and cocaine and they said at the end of his life he\u2019s sitting on the run and they\u2019re burning $100 bills in order to stay warm!

It\u2019s an example of just trying too hard\u2014not worth the trouble! So let\u2019s talk about unit of measure. Bitcoin as a unit of measure: I think Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. It makes sense in that way. Before Bitcoin, if you go back 50 years, people talked about ounces of gold. So I think a Bitcoin will be like an ounce of gold \u2014 an immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy \u2014 it makes sense to think of it like that! On the other hand, it will generally always be converted into local fiat in the political domicile in question for buying and selling things. And that\u2019s okay. There will be countries that allow stronger, better currencies. There will be countries that\u2019ll have weaker currencies and they\u2019ll crash their currencies and they\u2019ll replace their currencies. And as long as you HODL Bitcoin in your account you\u2019ll be able to go into a new country. You know, I\u2019ve been to a country after they crashed their currency. We\u2019ve all been to Germany, they crashed their currency, we bought the new currency. Then they got rid of the Mark and it was the Euro, we bought the Euro! So the right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy and not overthink it, anything more than that. It can be interesting to say divide stock price by gold ounces \u2014 you can divide the cost of living by ounces of gold or by Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s interesting! It\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll give you a pretty good read on inflation. If 1 Bitcoin buys you a car in the US but 1 Bitcoin buys you a skyscraper somewhere else then you\u2019ll have relative cost of living. People did that with the Dollar, right? They used to say you could live in Mexico on the beach for $187 a month and live like a king. There are relative strengths. I think Bitcoin will be like that! But I don\u2019t think we need to stretch it any further than that. I think that\u2019s enough! I think ultimately, people focus too hard on medium of exchange, unit of measure, and they underestimate the value of Bitcoin as a store of value and as an asset. I think they undersell it and they don\u2019t do it justice! Because it\u2019s so much better than every other asset! And then I think the entire community of crypto, it\u2019s too much engaged in debates between the various crypto networks, with each other. Because I\u2019ll post something \u2014 Bitcoin is a great way to transmit energy into the future \u2014 and then the Ripple people will start fighting, and the Bitcoin Cash people, someone gets triggered and takes offense. The way I see it is: Crypto is a $300 Billion pond sitting on the beach next to a $300 Trillion ocean of capital, of energy. That\u2019s 99.9% of all energy of humanity, is sitting in alt-assets, not altcoins! Not cryptocurrency! So I see all the crypto enthusiasts working on all the altcoins and they\u2019re just trying to drag down Bitcoin. It reminds me of a bunch of crabs in a bucket and the bucket\u2019s kind of hot or overheating and the one crab wants to crawl out and the other crabs just want to drag it back in instead of crawling on its back and getting out! It\u2019s like, all the crabs just keep pulling each other back into the bucket. It\u2019s totally self-sabotaging and it doesn\u2019t matter, because what they ought to be thinking is, How do we get $30 Trillion of the $300 Trillion to flow into our pond? In fact, they ought to be thinking, We want to go from $300 Billion to $3 Trillion, and from $3 Trillion to $30 Trillion, and from $30 Trillion to $300 Trillion. And the way you\u2019re gonna get there is not by attacking each other. The way you\u2019re gonna get there is by dividing the market and focusing! So if you want to be a cryptocurrency, well currency means you have to have a stable asset value because the IRS is gonna tax you to death if it changes. So Tether can be a currency, and it cannot change! Do we need one? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a centralized stablecoin, and maybe we need a decentralized stablecoin. The market will decide that. But that\u2019s a thing in its own. And if you want to build a crypto application, there are applications of things that people might want that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t do like: total privacy, or maybe you want to issue title or provenance, or maybe you want to do a decentralized exchange or wrap something or implement insurance or lending. That\u2019s fine \u2014 DeFi. There are applications \u2014 have at it! You\u2019d be better off to, say, Ethereum is 60% of the application market, Tether is 52% of the currency market \u2014 cryptocurrency and crypto app \u2014 and then Bitcoin is 95% of the crypto asset market. And if you believe in another type of asset, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s impossible to ever come up with one, I just think that right now the only clearly successful crypto asset is Bitcoin."}

How do I view it? And you tell me if I\u2019m right or wrong. I\u2019m a newcomer \u2014 you\u2019ve been around for a while. My view of crypto network is: A crypto network is a software application running on a decentralized network with a consensus mechanism, ideally proof of work, arguably maybe proof of stake or some other consensus mechanism that theorists would agree promotes decentralization and antifragility. And a digital network is a centralized network. It\u2019s a Facebook or Twitter or Google or Apple or whatever\u2014a more conventional client-server network. So as we look in the future of cyberspace we\u2019re gonna see crypto networks and digital networks. Why would you want a crypto network? You want a crypto network for immortal sovereignty and antifragility. We know Bitcoin is doing that right now. If you want to convey humanity across time and space \u2014 especially across time \u2014 maybe across time and domain, domain might be even better than space. You know, crypto networks aren\u2019t necessarily faster than digital networks for moving shit through space, but they\u2019re better at moving it across domains, and the reason for that is that sometimes you have lowest common denominator regulatory or compliance constraints that cripple the innovation in a digital network. Apple Computer will never do certain things because they\u2019re subject to the US law, even though they could do them in 98 countries! And so a crypto network may in fact develop faster across regulatory domains if digital networks are crippled. There\u2019s obviously trade-offs between digital and crypto, and I think about it as like: Trust, Security, and Duration are attributes of crypto. Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance are attributes of digital. If I want to do it cheap, it\u2019s a billion times cheaper on a digital network. [42:37] If I want performance, it\u2019s a million times faster on a digital network. If I want functionality, it\u2019s likely much more functional. There\u2019s nobody that would dispute that Apple Pay or Apple or Google, they\u2019re beautiful, functional products. Apple or Google Maps. Trying to do Google Maps on a decentralized crypto network would probably be a disaster! And then compliance \u2014 digital networks are better at compliance. Sometimes we regret their compliance. They shut down stuff and they censor things. But they\u2019re better at compliance. So the very things that make crypto attractive \u2014 Trust, Security, Duration \u2014 are purchased at the price of giving up Economy, Performance, Functionality and Compliance. The conclusion is: Some stuff makes better sense to be doing digitally, and other stuff maybe with crypto. It\u2019s early days, and the only obvious conclusion we both agree on is Bitcoin is a successful crypto network as a store of value. We know that. Everything else is an experiment and when it hits $100 Billion it\u2019s not an experiment anymore. And we can debate whether it\u2019s an experiment at $50 Billion, but I would say at $100 Billion it\u2019s a thing, and it\u2019s pretty clear. And it might be a thing we all know and recognize below that, but you\u2019d need a lot more education to determine that."}

And this reminds me of an old quote, If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. So the centralized solution is kind of like going alone, because it\u2019s just according to one single plan, it can innovate very quickly and move in a certain direction very quickly. Decision-making is concentrated. Whereas the decentralized solution has more of a dynamic equilibrium that lets it persist further across time. So the centralized solution is going to be really compliant, really fast, really innovative, but the decentralized solution is really only useful when you need censorship resistance. You need to know that it will persist across the maximum duration of time, and that no individual group or individual for that matter can shut it down or manipulate it. So Bitcoin is at the extreme end of that decentralized end of the spectrum, whereas something like Apple would be at the other end."}

A vertebrate versus invertebrates. Different life \u2014 plants versus animals. They\u2019re different creatures. And they have different life spans! You want to live for 2,000 years? Or do you want to live for 80 years? One of them moves faster than the other, but one of them is more vulnerable than the other. I think from a human point of view, the real question for humans is: Do you want to put your trust in Man, trust in the organization, trust in a company, trust in a government? And/or: Do you want to put your trust in a crypto network? And we\u2019re gonna solve our problems with a segmentation, mixture of these trusts. We\u2019re probably not gonna put the functionality into Bitcoin\u2014in a total decentralized proof of work network \u2014 that will do what Amazon does or Uber does or Pandora or YouTube does. Probably not! But do we really need to? We probably don\u2019t need to. So when we think about the crypto industry segmentation, I think you really want to divide and conquer. A crypto network is a life form. And I think that\u2019s different. I mean there\u2019s a genetic encoding in a crypto network, and it\u2019s very different than solving the problem with a human being or solving the problem even with a digital network. When you design the protocol, Bitcoin, and you let it go, it becomes a life form and it multiplies and all these nodes spread and all these miners spread. And you can\u2019t easily pull the genie back in the bottle and re-engineer the genetics of it when you\u2019ve released it into the wild. In fact, you would almost say that once plankton is spread out to dominate all the ecosystem \u2014 if God had a better idea \u2014 he created that and made those minnows! Or he created bacteria \u2014 he created a new species. You have a better idea? Create something different, and if that something different is in the same energy ecosystem as the plankton it\u2019s not gonna make it! [48:01] If you take a bird, the bird can coexist with a deer, but it\u2019s hard to create two apex predator birds and put them in the same space at the same time\u2014one of them eats the other one! One apex predator creature. And that\u2019s the same thing with crypto, I think. You gotta think of it as an evolution of a new life force in cyberspace, and the genetic code is of paramount importance! So if you really hope to be successful \u2014 and this is my opinion \u2014 when you release the privacy coin, you need to say, This is for this thing, and this is what it is, and we\u2019re going to get it just right and we\u2019re gonna let it breathe and let it live and we\u2019re not gonna mess with it or monkey with it. And we\u2019re not gonna decide that we wanted the monkey to have wings and also have gills and swim. And if I\u2019m watching TV and I see these cool antler things and I want to put the antlers on it! You can\u2019t be a technology-tinkering enthusiast with a crypto. You have to have more of the mindset of, It\u2019s the crazy guy in the lab coat in the laboratory creating a new kind of life, virus, creature. It\u2019s like you get one shot, and it\u2019s at a lab \u2014 and you\u2019re done! You can\u2019t get it back! And so you should be aware of just how important it is. It\u2019s a protocol. Life is a strand of DNA and that DNA is going to go and it\u2019s going to do whatever it\u2019s going to do. You\u2019re creating life. And so how devastating is it for God to say, I created human beings. I made a mistake. I\u2019m gonna recall them and then tinker and then do a human being 2.0. It\u2019s a problem, right? [50:04] In the Bible, the biblical analogy is the flood where everybody just gets killed. Or some crazy stuff in the Garden of Eden. But with things like Ethereum, right? You\u2019ve got Ethereum 1.0 and now you try to do Ethereum 2.0 \u2014 you\u2019d almost be better off just to do something different as opposed to like retrofit something, because it\u2019s going back and trying to force-fit the DNA. You could do it with a digital network. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re running on a single server and you can throw a switch and everybody switches with it. But the whole point of a decentralized life form is that they\u2019re all different and they all get to make their own decisions! And if you can order them to do something, it doesn\u2019t feel that decentralized anymore, does it?"}

It is the purpose of the crypto network to be an asset, and Bitcoin clearly is. And then Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision and the rest are trying to be. It seems pretty clear that Bitcoin is 93\u201394% of all the assets and the other ones are probably going to zero! And the only way you don\u2019t go to zero is: You have to be differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates you. It\u2019s a species, right? I can\u2019t be almost like a bunny rabbit, I need to be a wolf! I need to be different than a bunny rabbit! And it\u2019s an important caveat: Differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates. In other words: Differentiated in a way such that Nature gives you an advantage in natural selection. So taking Bitcoin, forking it, and making it do transactions 10 times faster isn\u2019t good enough because you\u2019re a million times slower than the other way to do transactions. So that\u2019s just not a genetic mutation that works. It\u2019s an example of a faulty genetic mutation that kills the carrier \u2014 it\u2019s an extinction-level mutation. Genetic mutations happen all the time in Nature. Most of them are mistakes. But some of them might work! If I can stand up on two feet and if my eyes start to work 10 times better than your eyes and I can fashion missiles then maybe that\u2019s gonna work for me. And maybe I will procreate. So it\u2019s not impossible to have a genetic mutation on Bitcoin that would be naturally advantageous. It\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s just, the ones you look at right now, like, what do you have? I mean, transaction speed? That\u2019s really no good. Privacy? It\u2019s a regulatory threat and so therefore it\u2019s probably a nice thing but it\u2019s a bullseye in its forehead which means that when the regulators go to shut down crypto exchanges the first thing they\u2019ll do is pass a law against that, right? And so, give me an example of a mutation on Bitcoin that would make it a distinct asset as a store of value that would deserve to have its own life?"}

Like Bitcoin sort of perfects the main properties of money that you need, and then the added caveat to that is that even if a mutation or innovation occurred such that the market identified it as useful and you saw this reflected in its market cap, Bitcoin also has this capacity to absorb feature set from competitors. So if something becomes market proven, Bitcoin can assimilate that into its existing UTXO set!"}

It\u2019s not impossible to conceptualize that maybe there would be one, but right now it looks like Bitcoin is 94% of the crypto-asset market. You can\u2019t include Ethereum because although it\u2019s proof of work now it\u2019s going to proof of stake, and they don\u2019t even have an intellectual commitment to be proof of [work 55:04]. And proof of stake is\u2014it\u2019s not clear to me that proof of stake is intellectually defensible over the long term. It\u2019s not proven. It seems like it may be defective as an idea, right? It\u2019s like an example \u2014 we\u2019re back to this issue: It\u2019s like I want to hobble the antelopes. It\u2019s like somebody complained we\u2019re using too much energy! It\u2019s almost like the environmentalists took over and they\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re just mad that someone\u2019s using too much energy so they want to pass a law to stop it. But it\u2019s a law against Mother Nature, and it\u2019s [brooding 55:44] to hobble the antelope. So the 4\u20135% of crypto-assets that are left \u2014 the Satoshi\u2019s Vision, Bitcoin Cash \u2014 none of them are differentiated enough that they would seem to have any future in a Darwinian world that I can see. So they\u2019re destined to [hugely 56:04] to go to zero. So then we go to cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a simple one \u2014 stablecoins. People go ballistic if you say they\u2019re cryptocurrencies because everybody wants Bitcoin to be a cryptocurrency! But if the definition of currency is money that you can legally spend in a country without incurring taxes, Bitcoin is not a currency, but Tether is! Because\u2014it\u2019s kind of simple \u2014 read the IRS tax code. You\u2019ll find, most places on Earth, they\u2019re gonna tax it as an asset. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! In fact, that\u2019s better. It\u2019s actually a mistake: Why would you want to create a short-term currency that\u2019s a billion times more expensive to implement computationally than the other way? It\u2019s like, the only reason you\u2019d want to do something a billion times more expensive is for immortality \u2014 immortal sovereignty! That\u2019s a good reason. But you\u2019ve got that. If you had that on 99% of your assets 99.9% of the time, then you\u2019re good. Then you could afford to have a little bit of risk in order to have a billion times faster performance on a digital network. So that\u2019s currencies. The only reason for a cryptocurrency is for regulatory arbitrage or maybe innovation due to decentralization. If you can make the argument that we\u2019re gonna innovate faster because we\u2019re governed by the laws of Singapore and people in Malta can use a Singaporean cryptocurrency and it\u2019s not technically illegal, it\u2019s just a hundred times better because we\u2019re able to tap into that regulatory arbitrage opportunity, you could call it a [free? 57:55] market, then I think, Okay! Fine! Then I think there\u2019s a place for a cryptocurrency."}

So Binance could simply move it \u2014 if I\u2019m moving money on an exchange or between exchanges, I could do that on a digital network. I don\u2019t need a crypto network to do it! So whether or not people use a digitally-based stablecoin or a crypto stablecoin, it\u2019s a function of regulatory arbitrage. I mean there are privacy issues that people have. And then there are trust issues."}

And so you could almost argue that if Tether is the king of stablecoins, it\u2019s running on a digital network, not a crypto network. Like, DAI \u2014 the irony is that DAI is a truly decentralized one \u2014 but people don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s inefficient and it doesn\u2019t quite peg the value. But you could create a cryptocurrency as a stablecoin using an oracle, using some information feed, and using Bitcoin as the underlying collateral and create a synthetic Dollar and a synthetic Euro! You could! And will we need it? It depends. I mean that takes us to crypto applications and digital applications. I mean Binance and Coinbase and Huobi and the like, they\u2019re digital exchanges. They\u2019re digital networks for exchange. And then you\u2019ve got the decentralized exchanges, right? Uniswap, SushiSwap. There\u2019s a very romantic notion, like, Decentralized exchanges will beat digital exchanges. I\u2019m not so sure! We\u2019ll see! The point that I made in one of my Tweets is: So I buy $400 Million worth of Bitcoin. I do it in 7 days. For 7 days, I have some exposure on a digital exchange. I move it to cold storage for the next 10 years or 20 years. So for the next 7,500 days it\u2019s off the digital exchange. So 99.9% or more of the time I\u2019m not exposed to the risk of a digital exchange, and so everyone that days, Well digital exchanges are risky. Well it\u2019s risky in the same way that walking across the street is risky, Robert. But you do it! In theory when you cross the crosswalk, if the red light failed, couldn\u2019t you get slammed into with a truck and killed? Okay, so are you gonna take the position that we\u2019re gonna have to build flyovers on every crosswalk in the world? Eh, pretty expensive! You know? So what will happen there? I don\u2019t know, but it seems to me that Binance is doing just fine as a centralized exchange. And it seems that Square works fine as a digital client application. And if Apple Computer announced that you could send Bitcoin or cash via Apple Pay or iMessage tomorrow, I think a lot of people would be pretty happy to do that! No one would be complaining about it! And it really comes down to this issue of: Economy \u2014 it\u2019s a million times cheaper, Performance \u2014 it\u2019s a million times faster, Functionality \u2014 it\u2019s a million times more functional, and Compliance \u2014 they\u2019re probably more compliant in the country you\u2019re in! So if you can do it on a digital network, you probably will! When you think about crypto, you really have to ask this question: What is so important that I want immortal sovereignty? What is so important? And certainly my life force. If you said to me, Michael, I\u2019m gonna take all of your energy and I\u2019m going to protect it and I\u2019m going to fulfill your wishes from now to 1,000 years from now \u2014 I think that\u2019s worth it! That\u2019s a religion! That\u2019s a crypto! You know, I have a park. I\u2019d like for the park to be trimmed and the trees to be kept nice and I\u2019d like for the park to be beautiful for the next 1,000 years and it\u2019ll cost $1 Million a year. And so if I put $50 Million into endowment and it generates 2% yield, then I could reasonably say to Robert, Robert, why don\u2019t you take my $50 Million endowment and put it into Bitcoin. And then it becomes the question of: How am I gonna see my wishes through for 1,000 years? Well the current way you would do it is you would create an institution like the Rockefeller Institution or the Hughes Institute. [1:04:08] And you trust human beings. What we\u2019re really talking about is: We\u2019re talking about the crypto-asset network of Bitcoin taking the base layer and holding all the monetary energy for 1,000 years. Or 100 years, if you think 1,000 years is crazy \u2014 we\u2019ll go 100 years. And then we\u2019re talking about a digital network. Maybe it\u2019s gardners.com or Amazon will probably do it because they\u2019ll probably do everything by the time we get through the decade. There will be nothing that they\u2019re not doing! Let me make it easier: Let\u2019s just say I want to send flowers to everyone in my family on their birthday for the next 100 years with a little note from me telling them how much I love them \u2014 that\u2019s a simpler thing. I endow an account with Bitcoin, I create an Amazon account, I wire it up with flowers, I create some kind of mechanism so that when children are born they get added to the family unit, and the thing drips out a little bit of monetary energy in Bitcoin, converts to fiat, buys the flowers for $187,000 a dozen roses in the year 2047, and it ships them for the person, and I die happy, and for the next 100 or 1,000 years, flowers get delivered to people in the Saylor family line because that was my last will and testament! And how would I do it if I was John D. Rockefeller 100 years ago? I would have a crapload of assets, probably a lot of gold and stock \u2014 and he owned every oil company and they\u2019re still around \u2014 and then you would put some of that into a foundation. A non-profit foundation, because you need tax-free, tax-advantaged. That\u2019s why you need to go non-profit. By the way, all of your capital gains become tax free, tax-advantaged, and all your income becomes tax-advantaged, right? So that\u2019s a good idea. And then you have a board of governance and you have 5 advisors and they appoint a money manager and they appoint a business manager and when one of them retires they have a selection committee process that puts someone else. We\u2019re probably on the 7th generation of advisors to the Rockefeller Institute. By the way, John D. Rockefeller created the University of Chicago. It\u2019s still running. Rockefeller created a lot of stuff that\u2019s still running! Rockefeller University. So I can do it the old-fashioned way, but to do it well you\u2019re probably talking about $100 Million of assets and a $5 Million a year operating budget. You get down to $1\u20132 Million it\u2019s not really \u2014 $5 Million a year is the minimum. Your best bet is you have to become a university, a religion, a church, or a non-profit, a Hughes Institute. So that\u2019s the way that you get immortal sovereignty, or like some long-range sovereignty. Another standard way people do it is like, Rockefeller bought up all the land on the Hudson River and he gives it to the state of New York, turn it into a state park or national park like Grand Teton National Park, and you get the federal government, the state government to agree to fund it in perpetuity per the Smithsonian Institution. The problem with all those things is that sometimes you just can\u2019t even trust the governments, right? But your best bet is you lay it off on a state or a federal government, and that\u2019s okay until the government fails or it reneges on something or other. The bottom line is that it\u2019s not really within the grasp of a small or mid-size business or the individual. What is YouTube? YouTube allows you to become your own TV station! So what are we talking about here? The clich\u00e9, Be your own bank, if we look at it a different way it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a normal person, I endow my own monetary energy into Bitcoin, I plug it into to some digital network, I give the keys to someone I trust \u2014 family member, heir \u2014 maybe I do multisig, right? Instead of having 5 people on a board \u2014 if you have 5 people on a board of an endowment with $100 Million or $1 Billion in the endowment, they\u2019re kept honest by filing annual tax forms with the IRS. And in theory they could be personally liable if they defraud the foundation or abuse their fiduciary trust. But you know it\u2019s kind of like a 20th Century idea! A better idea would be: I put the money into Bitcoin and I have 3 or 5 digital keys. And it takes 3 out of the 5 to vote on anything. And every 3 months they have to register that they\u2019re online and of healthy mind and spirit, and if someone stops registering then that remaining 4 automatically appoint a 5th, and whenever anybody retires they automatically transfer their key, and then what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve dematerialized an endowment, board of directors, corporation, institution. And it\u2019s just become maybe a simple application in cyberspace plugged into a base layer of monetary energy. And it\u2019s doing something! Whatever the something is. And so that\u2019s a combination of (1) people and (2) digital networks and (3) crypto networks in order to allow people to achieve their hopes and desires over long periods of time."}

So they\u2019re sitting on this money that you\u2019ve put behind the wall of encrypted energy, but it also gives it some dynamism in a way, that they can adapt to your will and testament."}

Okay so you appoint 3 trustees of the Breedlove Institute, you endow it with some amount of Bitcoin. You live a fine life, you depart, and their rules are: Every 10 years they have to find someone to replace them. You put your own term limits in there! By the way, you could put all sorts of rules in. You could say that everyone that actually reads my stuff and passes the test can vote on who the 5 trustees are gonna be. Or, you can\u2019t even be a trustee unless you\u2019ve watched and read everything and understood everything and passed my quiz that I left for you. What if Ludwig von Mises left all of his stuff in cyberspace and we\u2019d need to read all his stuff and pass it and pass an oral exam by him in order to become a fellow. And if we become a fellow we\u2019re invited into the academy of Austrian Economists, and that goes on to all eternity. And then the academy adds to the body of knowledge and they can upgrade the protocols and they can upgrade the tests and they can pass the flame down from generation to generation and the entire thing becomes antifragile and it\u2019s the religion of Austrian Economics! I\u2019m thinking the guild system. If you want something to be an immortal sovereign crypto network, then you think like the guilds. It\u2019s gotta be something that people are so passionate about they\u2019ll pass it down from parent to child, father to son, mother to daughter, master to student. There are things like that: schools of martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, religions, etc. And the medieval guilds were like that! Maybe there would be a \u2014 for example, I like environmental causes. What if I had a park and I said, Well people have to go in and they have to work in the park and support the park, but the park is this private/public entity where you can be a member and you get to use it but only if you can contribute to it and protect it. And then I endow it and it becomes a self-sovereign entity for 1,000 years. It\u2019s like a park-owner\u2019s association, right?"}

Or, I want to endow a professorship of Austrian Economics \u2014 but then someone takes over the university and so they divert the money to buy a new hot dog truck. So\u2014I\u2019m dead \u2014 how do I make sure that someone doesn\u2019t, that they really fulfill my last dying wish? How do I make sure? Well I can do it if I have a Rockefeller Institute and they hold the purse strings and they dole it out annually and then they watch. But then I have to actually have a bunch of people that I trust that 100 years from now will remember what my wishes were! And maybe nobody cares about that. It\u2019s a challenge for people. I went to Naples this year. And if you go to Naples, you go into the port, you have all these superyachts in the port, and very very wealthy people on the superyachts. But if you walk out of the port there\u2019s puddles on the floor and there\u2019s this park in the middle of Naples right next to the port and it runs about 10 blocks. And 50 years ago it was beautiful and the jewel of Naples and it was like Central Park and everyone could come there and enjoy the day. Now if you walk through it, all the buildings are spray-painted, they\u2019re all closed, there\u2019s pooling stinking water, no grass grows, it\u2019s just mud. It looks like something 40 years after the apocalypse! It\u2019s in the middle of like the third largest city in Italy. There\u2019s money everywhere, and yet somehow neither the municipal government nor the state nor the federal government of Italy, nor any wealthy person, can manage to come up with $100,000 Euros a year to water the grass and mow the lawn. In the middle of a city of a million people \u2014 the public jewel the city, the single most important piece of real estate in the entire city\u2014is suffering from a tragedy of the commons. Now I ask myself: If I was that wealthy person and I wanted to bring that park to life, if you wanted to do it top-notch you need $1 Million Euros a year. You want to do spectacular? $10 Million Euros a year. If you want to just mow the lawn and water it and keep it from being a stinking, mud-infesting war zone? $100,000 Euros a year. How do I actually endow that park without having the money hijacked by whoever hijacked the money? Because obviously none of the economic energy is making it to that park in the middle of Naples. It might be a more worthy cause just giving a third of my money to the government as tax on my death, or two-thirds when I die for them to \u2014 whatever they\u2019re doing, like, What could you say about a civilization that can\u2019t keep its central park in its most important city in the province from being a stinking, post-apocalyptic zone?"}

So people have wishes. They have a hard time realizing their wishes. There\u2019s a lot of ways to do it, and the theoretical magic way to do it is: I create a program on a crypto network in cyberspace, it runs on a blockchain network \u2014 nobody can stop it, ever, it\u2019s unstoppable code \u2014 it\u2019s literally a magic spell! A less intense way is: I power it with crypto network and I use a combination of people and digital networks to do it. I think ultimately people can achieve what they want in a variety of ways. If I want to be fed, I can feed myself by hunting a deer, hunting some chickens, growing some corn \u2014 these are all different ways to achieve what you want. The real key is: I need to have mastered the technology of hunting, cultivating animals, wildlife, and farming. And if I have all three of those technologies on my fingertips that I can mix and match, then I can actually do something interesting. I think that\u2019s the potential here. We talked about: Money is power. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So if you apply advanced technology to money, then you can give someone magic power. The source of magic power is providing an instruction into the digital and crypto network space and powering it with crypto network space such that you cast a spell in the future, or cast a curse into the future when you\u2019re long gone. That\u2019s real magic, right? Like, casting a curse 30 years after I die \u2014 that\u2019s impressive magic! Less interesting but more practical is: I just want to cast a spell while I\u2019m alive. And the magic spell I would cast, were I a magician, is I would go to that park in Naples and I\u2019d wave my hand and it would become a beautiful paradise with gorgeous trees and nice grass and water flowing and cleanliness and safety and free ice cream cones for the kids and flowers and happy music and concerts on the green. And it would be like that forever, because that\u2019s my magic! By the way, in fantasy, the great magicians, the demi-gods, the powerful wizards, they have magic power \u2014 they can do that! And the more powerful they are, the longer the spell lasts. So if I have $1 Million, I can do it for a year. If I have $100 Million, I can do it forever. If I have $1 Billion, I can allocate 10% of my power to do it there forever. Magic power, right? Money is power. You got enough money, you can snap your fingers, materialize a jet, it\u2019ll fly you to Tokyo on 10 hours notice. It\u2019ll cost you about $250,000, if that\u2019s how you want to expend your energy. If you don\u2019t have enough energy it doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t have $250,000 \u2014 right? The other part in those magic stories is the mere mortal that wants that same trip, their life force is sucked out of them and they\u2019re aged 82 years and they die! If I take a middle-class person making $72,000 a year and they need to fly from New York to Tokyo for $250,000, that\u2019s all the savings they\u2019re ever gonna have! I just sucked their life force out of them to cast that spell. And so how much power do you have? And how much magic can you bring to bear? Look, John D. Rockefeller had magic. He just did it the old fashioned way. And his son did, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. They went to all the beautiful places on the Earth, they bought them all up, and then they ended up turning them into national parks. The US Virgin Islands is a Rockefeller Park. St. John, they bought. Acadia, they bought a lot of Mount Desert Island, made it a national park. Grand Tetons, they bought all that land, made it a national park. Most of the land up and down the Hudson River \u2014 between they and J.P. Morgan \u2014 they bought it and made it a state park. They were casting spells."}

The senator from Rhode Island. So I think that in a nutshell is my views on crypto. I think ultimately we\u2019re moving into an exciting world where people are gonna be able to achieve great things with a variety of digital networks and crypto networks. What we can see right now for sure is: There is at least one successful crypto network \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 there are many successful dominant digital networks \u2014 YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc., plenty of them \u2014and the future is gonna be defined by these networks, and you just gotta decide what\u2019s the best tool for the problem? You can solve problems with people. I can pick up the phone, I can call you and I can say, Robert, buy me $100 Million worth of Bitcoin! And I solve the problem with a person. Or I can solve the problem with a digital network. I can go online on Binance and I can start like typing and trading, and I can buy $100 Million worth of Bitcoin. Or I could solve the problem with Uniswap \u2014 with a decentralized total crypto network. What will happen? The market will determine\u2014what we know is that over time, what was done by people will start to be done with digital networks, and what was done by digital networks may in fact float into crypto networks to the extent that sovereign immortality is worth the trouble. And if you\u2019re gonna make a crypto network \u2014 if they\u2019re just doing it for regulatory arbitrage it\u2019s probably got a 10-year life span and it\u2019s shaky \u2014 because who\u2019s gonna lay down in front of a tank for something like the difference between Binance and Uniswap? Would you sacrifice your life to try to trade on Uniswap instead of Binance? Because I wouldn\u2019t! Let me tell you what they\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for: They\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for Freedom, for their Religious Values, for the Future of their Family, for the Future of their Ideology. If they have a passionate belief, they will lay down in front of a tank in order to defend it. The principles of Science and Justice and Humanity and Truth. Not everybody! But you don\u2019t need everybody! You need the keepers of the flame. You need the maximalists. The 1% who are willing to fight and die for the principles. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We didn\u2019t come up with it here today in this call. It was a basic truth that founded a lot of things including the United States of America. And if you go back to the Roman Republic, there were a lot of Romans when the Roman Republic was healthy, and they were willing to fight and die for Roman principles. To a certain extent, a lot of good Romans assassinated Julius Caesar because they thought they were fighting for Roman principles. And a lot of wars were fought over it. So if you really want a crypto to be successful over 100 years, the technology is only a part of it, right? It\u2019s the ideology paired with the technology. And you\u2019re gonna have to have an ideology that is so pure and so straightforward that people will fight to the death to defend the ideology. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m probably not gonna sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts! It\u2019s not that important! On the other hand, if you tell me that we\u2019re about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages, then I think I\u2019ll fight for it. That\u2019s worth fighting for."}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-8-oZhkfOHyBj-/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 8 | Bitcoin and Immortal Sovereignty", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:31:00]: Alright guys! That was Episode 8, and man! Just another big, deep dive into Bitcoin and its implications! Globally, really. So we started the episode out talking about how divinity of engineering. As Saylor mentioned, the beaver \u2014 which is the mascot for MIT \u2014 the reason the beaver is the mascot of this engineering-focused school, MIT, is because the beaver is really special! He actually goes into nature and harvests materials and re-sculpts the flow of rivers, frankly, by damming it and using his wits and ability to build a habitable structure for himself and his family when he goes to reproduce. So the beaver ends up being this symbol for this divine quality \u2014 that really life has \u2014 which is engineering. This divine quality of engineering has found its highest expression in Man. At least as far as we know, we are the animal most capable of harnessing this quality that the ancients would call the Logos, which is the ability to confront the chaos of nature, dissect it with the categorical capabilities of our mind and our words, communicate about its properties and qualities to learn about nature, and basically convert this unexplored territory into explored territory, and convert chaos into good and habitable order. And this is a really deep and ancient idea, but it\u2019s something fundamental to life and to humans. And civilization itself we can think of as just a bubble of this habitable order amid the unlivable entropy of the universe. And you can see this even in like the Southeast United States, there were areas in say Mississippi that were just not habitable whatsoever prior to the invention of the air conditioner! So that\u2019s maybe one extreme example but there were literally places \u2014 geographic locations on Earth \u2014 that we simply could not live until we became sufficiently advanced technologically. And Saylor has a great quote on this. He says, \u201cHumans are divine when they engineer a better habitat for themselves and those they love through their intellect.\u201d So again this to me points back to work, which Bitcoin\u2014as we\u2019ve discussed \u2014 it\u2019s money rooted in proof of work as gold was. Work itself is a noble pursuit, right? It is the means by which we convert chaos into good and useful order, and I would argue that it elevates our timelessness. It\u2019s actually allowing us to accomplish greater results with less efforts in terms of making productivity gains. It\u2019s also lowering our time preference, making us more long-term oriented. And in this process we develop more morality, more selflessness even, and we also develop greater survivability as a species. So when the entropy of nature inevitably creeps in, we have the ability to respond to it. If there\u2019s a natural disaster or something out of sort, we can harness resources from other pockets of civilization and channel them into the affected areas such that they can recuperate. So I thought that was just a really interesting topic, and it points towards the instrumentality of Bitcoin in helping us better focus on this divine quality. Bitcoin really is money purpose-built for entrepreneurial experimentation which involves engineering and problem-solving. Whereas you could look at something like fiat currency: much more based on bureaucratic theft. We\u2019re talking about individuals and organizations that add no value to the productive economy and just siphon value off of those that do [out in 1:35:30] the world and engineer. So in that sense, by re-enabling and re-energizing work itself, we could view Bitcoin as a form of divine money, in a way. And then we got into Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. And in 2017 during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, there was a bit of a delusion in related to this word \u201ccash\u201d in the whitepaper where Satoshi called Bitcoin originally peer-to-peer cash. And the thought was \u2014 at least by the Roger Vers of the world who represented Bitcoin Cash\u2014that Bitcoin needed to be used in day-to-day transactions. What this is ignorant of actually is the original meaning of the word cash, which comes from the French word caisse, which meant money box. And this was used as a term in the 19th Century to indicate final settlement. So it was a bearer-asset money. Physical gold, physical silver was said to be cash. And only in the modern age have we sort of repurposed this word to mean the government debt certificates that we trade with today and call money. And knowing what a genius Satoshi was, I am confident he was clear on this meaning of cash, and did not mean Bitcoin needed to be used as a day-to-day medium of exchange to proliferate. And by the way, even if he did, it doesn\u2019t matter, because the market selects the purpose and utility of a tool. So Bitcoin is being selected \u2014 has been selected \u2014 by the market as a store of value. And that\u2019s the direction we think it\u2019ll keep going. So the magic of Bitcoin if you will \u2014 as we\u2019ve discussed in earlier episodes \u2014 is this ability to transfer monetary energy in a loss-minimized way. So you can send energy across time and space with minimal loss, essentially. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important, not the ability or speed or low transaction fee to move it at a high frequency \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. So to Saylor\u2019s point on that, the Bitcoin network is optimized for suviveability \u2014 that\u2019s what decentralization is, is that it\u2019s a very slow and inefficient database, but with that slowness and inefficiency comes maximal redundancy. And with that redundancy comes resistance to large attacks, specifically nation-state level attacks, which would be the most powerful organizations in the world today. So if you needed a medium for high frequency transaction, so you\u2019re always going to get more economy and efficiency by moving to a centralized system like PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Visa, whatever. Because the database only needs to be updated once. Versus Bitcoin has to be replicated everywhere and nowhere across all nodes and miners. So that\u2019s the trade-off and we\u2019ll get into more of that shortly. But in a nutshell I like the description Saylor uses that Bitcoin is a low frequency medium of exchange, meaning you only need to move it occasionally, maybe never if you custody it correctly. But it\u2019s a high frequency store of value. So every time you\u2019re HODLing, you\u2019re using it. So the people who argue that Bitcoin has no utility, they don\u2019t understand this economic principle whatsoever. And further to that, even if you absolutely wanted to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, most tax codes in the world today are hostile to that. They\u2019ll actually trigger capital gains realization at each transaction. [1:39:31] So it really suppresses its use as a medium of exchange. And another way to think about this \u2014 it gets a little more complicated \u2014 but actually when you\u2019re holding something as a store of value, trades are not just with other people. Trades are also with ourselves. Like infinite slices of our future selves. So every time you choose to hold cash or hold Bitcoin or hold gold \u2014 cash in its original sense \u2014 and not trade it, you are basically trading with your future self. So you are giving away the opportunity that the cash could have otherwise been traded for \u2014 whatever its cash value in the market is, it could go out and buy you X assets \u2014 you\u2019re forgoing those assets and choosing to hold the optionality of cash. Whereas those assets may have real yield! They may be productive assets, rent-generating real estate or whatever it may be, whereas hard money doesn\u2019t actually create yield. So you\u2019re actually\u2014the most trades you do in life are not actually with present others but they are with your future self. All these infinite slices of your future self. Every action or inaction even is a set of trades with those future slices of yourself. So we could look at the actual store of value function truly being much more important as a medium of exchange than a present medium of exchange with present others. So that\u2019s just an interesting way to conceive of money, that it\u2019s something that you\u2019re holding onto to have maximum optionality into the future, and that holding is a trade with you even though it\u2019s not a trade with others. And this also dovetailed into why Saylor chooses not to compensate people in Bitcoin and why he thinks it\u2019s a bad idea to do so, because again if you\u2019re using it primarily as a store of value you may not sell it ever or for say at least 100 years. By choosing to compensate people in Bitcoin you\u2019re accelerating that tax bill 100 years into the future, so that\u2019s a really bad idea. You\u2019re also increasing the accounting complexity of the business which would be the payer and the payee. They both need to mark Bitcoin to market at each point of transaction. You\u2019d also be forcing \u2014 say if you\u2019re compensating your employee with Bitcoin \u2014 you\u2019re forcing them to sell it later to actually cover the tax bills generated as a result, so that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. In a nutshell, as Saylor said, the ethos of Bitcoin is self-responsibility. So you should pay and settle in whatever the generally accepted medium of exchange is, the one the tax code is not hostile against, which tends to be currency. And then if you have savings \u2014 you have excess currency or excess assets \u2014 you would, as Saylor does, sweep them into your savings or your treasury for long-term storage. That\u2019s the optimal and intelligent and low-complexity strategy. We get into a bit about how optionality itself is freedom. The more options you have the more free you are. And this has direct impact on the stability of society. Saylor quoted Robert Heiland who said, \u201cAn armed society is a polite society.\u201d So to tie that back to Bitcoin and capital it\u2019s like, when people have this option of capital flight \u2014 they have this perpetual option to move their money across domain, across time, across custodian \u2014 and settle finality nearly instantly, that governments and institutions and service providers, they\u2019re gonna tend to be more respectful because the customer holding the capital has such a high degree of optionality. So you could think about this too: When you go to the amusement park, the food and drink cost in an amusement park tend to be really high. A soda that you may pay $3 for at your local convenience store might be $8\u201310 in that amusement park. And it\u2019s because the amusement park has what\u2019s called a captive audience premium. You have no other choice. You have no other options to buy food or drink once you are within the bounds of that amusement park, and they can effectively charge you monopoly-style prices. And if you look at Bitcoin capital through that lens it\u2019s kind of removing that captive audience premium that legacy institutions or nation states tended to have over users. And we could say that if users have the ability to move the money whenever they want, they don\u2019t actually need to, it\u2019s just the fact that that option exists keeps everyone honest, keeps everyone listening to one another\u2019s preferences, because no one wants the capital to move. So the point of this is that a symmetry of options, a symmetry of optionality between buyer and seller and stability of the rules and the protocols through which they interact, this is the bedrock of peace. This is what preserves peace. But when you get asymmetries, when one group has a lot of optionality over another, that\u2019s when you get predatory treatment. And I would say central banking falls much more into that model, where they get this perpetual call option on society basically, that they can allocate cash into businesses, the shareholders values being increased, the dividends being paid, and if there\u2019s ever a shock to the economy and the institutions that have deployed that capital into risky positions get wiped out, well the central bank just siphons more value from the productive economy through printing money and allocates again. So it\u2019s a Heads I Win, Tails You Lose situation for central banks over productive economies. So Bitcoin is just eliminating this, this captive audience premium or asymmetry of optionality. Another way to think about this too is \u2014 to get back into Bitcoin is Money \u2014 we can actually consider the monetary premium itself on an asset as its optionality value. So the more tradable an asset is, the more a component of its market value is its expected future exchange. So for instance if ammo has a very specific use \u2014 it can be put into a gun and fired and a gun can be used to kill people or animals or whatever \u2014 but if in an environment of ammunition scarcity, people may also be willing to trade other goods and services for that ammunition, so that ammunition will start to trade at a premium not just for its utility value \u2014 not that its utility value has increased necessarily \u2014 but that its exchange value or its optionality value has increased. The extreme example of this would be gold. Gold has a \u2014 I think we\u2019re at an almost $12 Trillion market cap for gold \u2014 the industrial demand for that is less than $2 Trillion, I want to say it\u2019s closer to $1 Trillion. The rest of that demand or the rest of that market cap for gold is reservation demand for gold as money. It best fulfilled the properties of money which made it maximally exchangeable across space and time. In that lens too we could say that Bitcoin is like the world\u2019s first pure money. It\u2019s pure monetary premium. There\u2019s not really an industrial use beneath it. Some have argued that actually the transaction network was kind of the original utility that bootstrapped its monetary premium into existence. Maybe you could make that argument. But the point is that it\u2019s a tool of pure optionality, because it\u2019s pure monetary premium. Whereas you could look at things that are less tradable, where a much larger part of their market value would be their use, their industrial use value versus their trading value. So money exists on this gradient is the point. Something that\u2019s very not-tradable, high non-fungible, very specific \u2014 purple telescopes or something weird like that \u2014 it\u2019d be valued just on its use, mostly just on its use. Not on its future expected exchange value. But something like Bitcoin and money itself \u2014 at the other end of the spectrum \u2014 is valued on its expected future exchange value. I think it was Naval said that Money is the bubble that never pops. Because this delta between market and industrial use value has been called a bubble by some people. But what it actually is underlying that is the value of the monetary properties giving rise to that exchangability. So that got us into Bitcoin as a unit of account. Saylor had a great quote on this. He expects that, \u201cBitcoin will be a universal language of economic truth.\u201d I fully agree! It is the predictability of the supply of money that gives rise to its utility and pricing of goods and services with it. That\u2019s what gold was, it had the most predictable supply of any monetary metal and that\u2019s why all of the liquidity and market capitalization coalesced to gold. And that\u2019s too for that reason we used to think actually in ounces of gold. Even dollars themselves represented ounces of gold originally. The time and energy of market actors that produce every good and service in the world, this tool \u2014 money, or gold \u2014 most closely mapped onto the absolute scarcity of time and energy. So gold was the supply curve that was closest to the absolute immutable perfectly scarce supply curve of time and energy. And this gave it the ability to basically generate prices that were generally the most stable \u2014 not saying that they enforced stability \u2014 but they tended to be most stable because gold had the lowest and most predictable inflation which also meant prices were more useful in calculation. They weren\u2019t fluctuating wildly over time. And they were communicable. So we could actually start to just think in ounces of gold for goods and services instead of needing to think in all these countless exchange ratios \u2014 how many chairs a car is worth or whatever it may have been. So I agree that Bitcoin is gonna go that way. But as far as where it is today \u2014 I love this point \u2014 Saylor was saying there\u2019s a lot of in-fighting in the crypto community about is Bitcoin gonna be the thing or Ethereum or this or that, but it\u2019s all essentially pointless. The crypto-asset ecosystem at the time we recorded was around a $300 Billion pond sitting next to a $300 Trillion ocean of assets which a lot of them are just intended to hold value over time. Store of value assets \u2014 gold, bonds, real estate \u2014 all fall into this ocean. And that\u2019s where our energy should be focused is actually carving a little spill-away from the ocean into the pond here, not competing amongst ourselves because frankly as we\u2019ve covered in previous episodes, Bitcoin is just highly resistant to disruption as money. It\u2019s not like other crypto-assets won\u2019t succeed in something orthogonal to money, something that\u2019s not in the market for money. There\u2019s technology that may have other use cases, there\u2019s a lot of theory out there. But today it\u2019s just not proven! So I agree completely that our focus as educators or ambassadors for Bitcoin needs to be geared towards those still holding and interacting with these other alternative stores of value so they can understand why Bitcoin is possibly the sole store of value asset for the 21st Century, the only way you could successfully transfer value 100 years into the future with the least loss. So I agree with that completely. We then jumped into crypto versus digital networks. Again crypto network we can think of as a decentralized consensus model. And this is using Saylor\u2019s nomenclature: The digital network would be centralized consensus. So just sort of one entity or decision-making body deciding. And there are different use cases for the two and there are different trade-offs between them, clearly. So crypto network would be useful for establishing what Saylor calls immortal sovereignty or antifragility, which means that they are able to persist over time. Decentralized crypto networks have a high degree of survivability and they impart properties like trust-minimization, security, and duration. So you don\u2019t need to trust the centralized decision-making body. Instead you trust the aggregate self-interest of all market actors in a centralized network. And this is clearly gold or this is Bitcoin. Again gold \u2014 it\u2019s not built on cryptography per se, but the inability of producers to create gold in a lab basically meant that the whole world was decentralized around gold as money. There was no political actor that could control it until central banks accumulated a large stake in the supply and started manipulating it in the gold derivatives market which we talked about before. On the other hand of the spectrum from a crypto network is a digital network. Which as opposed to survivability is useful for squeezing efficiency out of a system, eliminating redundancy. Where a decentralized network is gonna be fully redundant\u2014you\u2019re talking about all these nodes and miners all over the world all running a copy of Bitcoin and updating all the time, so it\u2019s a huge expenditure of energy to establish your redundancy \u2014 a digital network is gonna just have one record base that can be updated very quickly, very low latency, very low redundancy. So the properties that it imparts are Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance. And to draw back to \u2014 where you could say gold is decentralized money \u2014 you could say fiat is more like a centralized money. So because gold was expensive to move across space, we could introduce this centralized database on top of it called fiat currency that let us do ledger entries really quickly in gold. So we picked all of this transactability across space but we introduced this attack vector for intermediaries that actually compromised gold\u2019s store of value function over time. The only market-proven crypto network in the world today is non-state digital store of value Bitcoin \u2014 everything else is theoretical. This is not to say that actually a digital network can\u2019t evolve into a crypto network! It kind of reminded me of our earlier discussion of the Steel Age where newly charted industrial spaces tend to have monopolists won out in the beginning, and then those monopolists set standards, and then over time that market becomes commodified and tends back toward a more freely competitive domain based on this standard. So it\u2019s as if a digital network could establish certain protocol standards for a decentralized network and then turn over the keys so to speak to the market. And then if there was sufficient demand for whatever utility it\u2019s providing, it could become decentralized over time if you handled it correctly. We haven\u2019t really seen that yet. We\u2019ve seen some attempts at it but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen it done really cleanly yet. But this evolution, a successful evolution from a digital to a crypto network, would require sufficient differentiation. One that would end up being useful as a competitive advantage in this market-driven natural selection process. Again I think Bitcoin has already run and won the race for money, so it would have to be a different market. And it\u2019s difficult! It\u2019d be really difficult to accomplish this differentiation given Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to absorb a competitor\u2019s feature set. In a biological sense we call this horizontal gene transfer. Where \u2014 Brandon Quittem has written and talked about this \u2014 Mycelium has this ability when it encounters a threat in the environment, if it neutralizes the threat and consumes it, a competing Mycelium or an insect or whatever, it can actually digest its genetic code and incorporate that information into its own genetic code! So we typically think of animals having vertical gene transfer from parent to offspring, but there\u2019s something more competitive in nature \u2014 this horizontal gene transfer where you can just slurp up genetic material from competitors. And Bitcoin exhibits that in the digital domain! So the point is that the differentiation necessary for a digital network to evolve into a crypto network would have to overcome this horizontal gene transfer of Bitcoin as well, which would otherwise just absorb it and render the attempted evolution unnecessary. So finally we got into this concept of immortal sovereignty which I thought was just incredibly interesting. [1:59:33] You can think about this as channeling ones preferences beyond ones own life, and this is not a new idea actually. Saylor gave this general example of: If he wanted to buy flowers for everyone in his family for the next 100 years on their birthday, how would he accomplish that? He drew on examples from John D. Rockefeller and he said, Rockefeller would have established \u2014 using the tech of his time \u2014 to accomplish this \u201cimmortal sovereignty\u201d by either establishing a non-profit foundation, an endowment, a university, or possibly even a national state park. But this necessitated really big numbers and was limited to just a few ultra-rich people that could do it. And again these are \u2014 when Rockefeller was alive I guess almost 100 years ago now, you\u2019re talking about $100 Million in assets with $5 Million a year operating budget in 1920 Dollars. So big, big numbers were necessary to achieve this immortal sovereignty that Bitcoin delivers to us in a much more cost-effective way today! Additionally, no matter what you set up \u2014 foundation, endowment, university \u2014 you would still encounter this counterparty risk because you\u2019d have to trust the institution, you\u2019d have to trust the government protecting the institution. But Bitcoin gives us an interesting thing which is a monetary layer that enables us to dematerialize these institutions but still achieve similar \u2014 this immortal sovereignty if you will. And it does because you can actually assign the trustees \u2014 in say a multisig setup \u2014 keys to the funds to accomplish the aims of the digital foundation. But because their property rights wouldn\u2019t be exposed to counterparty risk in the form of an institution or a government, they would actually gain a great deal of dynamism to roll with or get through geopolitical changes such that they could preserve the original mission of that institution. So you could think of it as immortal sovereignty at just a much lower cost! Which I think just speaks to the grander vision of Bitcoin, right? It\u2019s like: Why do we have these stories like the nation state and universities organizing us, and what is possible when we instead maximize the sovereignty of the individual? Like how relevant do those institutions remain? The other example he gave is if you wanted to host your website reading material for 1,000 years into the future, you could code all kinds of interesting rules around that! Maybe requiring people to pass a test and become a certified student of your knowledge, and then maybe they gain a voting right to choose the next trustee of the institution, and it becomes this dynamic digital autonomous democratic organization that just rolls forward in time. It\u2019s really wild when you imagine the possibilities. It points towards all the new institutional possibilities enabled by Bitcoin. Which in my opinion it calls into question the structure and the purpose of the firm today. So Bitcoin gives us this monetary layer capable of dematerializing these institutions we\u2019ve needed in the past for sovereignty, to establish what Saylor called immortal sovereignty. And it does it in a way that empowers the trustees of these organizations to be self-sovereign, so that they can actually resist geopolitical sea changes and adapt to changes in political climates of the time. Whereas historically you would\u2019ve needed to trust that institution itself, and should it be invaded in wartime or broken down due to a civil dispute within the country, then you would\u2019ve lost the sovereignty that you would\u2019ve vested trust in the state park or whatever the will you were trying to project beyond your life \u2014 its fate would\u2019ve been vested with the survivability of the sovereignty of that institution. So Bitcoin\u2014by being a monetary base layer that maximizes the sovereignty of individuals and being optimized for survivability \u2014actually gives us a whole new way of establishing this immortal sovereignty across time! Another way to think about that is: Bitcoin is collapsing the cost of money, it\u2019s collapsing transaction cost, it\u2019s collapsing the costs of satisfying the functions of the central bank, and it also just collapses this cost of immortal sovereignty. Which again, the Rockefeller\u2019s needed $100 Million in assets and a $5 Million annual operating budget to achieve to establish the Rockefeller Foundation. Now you can do that in theory at least with just a much smaller Bitcoin stash, some software, and some really long-term strategic thinking! So I like the analogy too that Saylor used: If you wanted to host your website reading materials for the course of 1,000 years, you could actually chop up the keys to that institution \u2014 the Bitcoin endowment for that institution \u2014 give it to 5 trustees, encode a set of rules such that people have to read your materials and pass a test to maybe gain a voting right so that they get to decide the [successor] to each trustee. And in that way the thing kind of becomes this decentralized autonomous organization over time that just preserves your will and testament which was to have this body of knowledge go into the future for the benefit of humanity. So I thought that was really cool and points to just the new possibilities that Bitcoin brings into the world! It not only causes us to question the purpose of the firm itself and other organizational models we use, but it\u2019s also creating something that\u2019s truly timeless. And this is where\u2014 Saylor called this, Creating monuments in cyberspace \u2014 I thought that was a really cool way to look at it, is that by gaining immortal sovereignty through Bitcoin-enabled institutions, we can actually create things that well-outlive us yet still are shaped and influenced by our living will and testment beyond our own life. Finally we got into a topic we touched on earlier which was that money is power. And we combined it with another topic that we touched on previously which was that sufficiently advanced technology is magic. So by combining these two concepts we\u2019d say that a sufficiently advanced monetary technology is magical power, effectively! And it lets its users cast spells or cast curses. On the spell side we went into this park in Naples that as Saylor described was surrounded by wealth but for whatever reason was not receiving an allocation of that wealth to preserve the park and keep it pristine. So again to establish that immortal sovereignty historically they had to go out and buy up this land and basically turn it into national parks because they were then vesting their will and testament with the longest-lived sovereign power of the time \u2014 which was the nation state \u2014 to maximize the chances of preserving their intention across time. The point there was that the 501c3 non-profit foundation laws \u2014 they were actually written by Rockefeller\u2019s attourneys! So this shows the relationship between money and government. The common misconception is that the government is the originator of money, but what is in fact true is that money is the originator of government! That wealth itself tends to shape the laws around it that determine its management, preservation, and distribution over time. On the other side where we were talking about casting a curse \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk a lot about this but just thinking out loud, if you had an organization like Anonymous, which is this anonymous set of computer hackers distributed all over the world, you could in theory fund them in perpetuity with a Bitcoin-based smart contract enabled endowment that would effectively fund their hacking attempts or attempts to say dissolve the power structures of government or to remedy any government mistreatment of civilians \u2014 things like that. So it could be used in both a defensive way \u2014 say to defend the park in Naples \u2014 but it could also be used offensively to attack hostile organizations like national government. So that\u2019s just an incredible way to think about how many ways Bitcoin not only shapes and influences our willpower and intention by lowering our time preference and elevating our morality, but also gives us this medium through which to project it over much longer time and space horizons! So it really is one of those tools that is just radically shaping who we are. We touched on the religious aspects of Bitcoin, but even if you just strip that out and said it\u2019s just an ideology, it is perhaps one of the most pure and principled ideologies there\u2019s ever been! If you respect Fairness, Equality, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Mathematics, Freedom \u2014 that\u2019s what Bitcoin positively embodies essentially! And such a pure and pristine ideology is something people find worth fighting and even dying for. So it does have these qualities of a religion or of its own independent nation state if you will. It\u2019s just challenging all of our language even to describe what it is. Although we focus on its monetary properties exploring it as money by asking this question, What is Money?, I think we come to see Bitcoin as even much more than that. Or perhaps even saying money is much more than that! Money is foundational. It\u2019s like the base operating system to all these other higher order operating systems we have like the nation states and religious institutions, etc. As I said once before, people come to Bitcoin for the profits, I think almost everyone\u2019s drawn in by Number Go Up, but I think the people that really come and stay and find roots in Bitcoin and purpose and meaning and devoting their lives to this space, they stay for the principles! Bitcoin \u2014 come for the profits, stay for the principles. So that was it, that was Episode 8 guys. I hope you enjoyed that one. This has just been a dynamite series so far. We\u2019ve got at least one episode left so I look forward to that and I\u2019ll see you at the next one!"}

We are back with Saylor Series Episode 7! Today we will be diving even deeper into Bitcoin theory and as always if you guys haven\u2019t seen Episodes 1\u20136 that led us to this point I highly suggest you go and check those out. They build a lot of foundation that we draw upon continually as we progress further into this series. So today we\u2019re gonna discuss Bitcoin as a monetary missile, which if you remember from Episode 1, missiles are one of the quintessential Stone Age technologies so we draw analogies to that. We also talk about Bitcoin as the creature that never sleeps. Again to the great Kraken itself and why this makes it a superior form of money. We\u2019ll also look at the effects of humans intervening into complex systems and what that does to complex systems and the consequences that it generates. And finally we\u2019ll look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin may actually be the sole sound store of value for the 21st Century, we\u2019ll compare it to alternatives and draw the reasons why it is superior across a number of dimensions. Then we\u2019ll get into the Talebian concept of via negativa and how it relates to Bitcoin and technology more generally. Finally we get into a really interesting aspect of Bitcoin not often discussed. And that is the \u2014 we look into the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a value creator for this asset class itself. And that leads us naturally into discussion of Bitcoin as a religion. We\u2019re gonna go deep again today. I\u2019m really excited for this one. So let\u2019s dive in!"}

This is extremely high bandwidth price discovery and transparency, right? The highest bandwidth price discovery, the highest bandwidth market of any security, of any asset ever! I mean, Bitcoin really is the perfected asset, or at least the apex asset in the financial jungle, because it\u2019s the creature that never sleeps, that\u2019s an octopus that\u2019s working everywhere all the time. The metaphor \u2014 Kraken \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty good metaphor because it\u2019s always going and it\u2019s never stopping. And remember back to our previous discussion, I was saying in Jurassic Park the guy picks a fight with the little dinosaur and then he realizes that there\u2019s a hundred of those little dinosaurs and they don\u2019t sleep. And when you pick a fight with a swarm and the swarm doesn\u2019t sleep and you sleep, you realize you\u2019re gonna lose! You\u2019re doomed! There\u2019s that point you\u2019re gonna realize you\u2019re doomed because you can\u2019t keep up with a software creature with a million heads that is continuously working everywhere all the time. And here\u2019s the thing you know: the thing that\u2019s working that\u2019s dominating the market in Bitcoin all the time \u2014 it\u2019s the strongest version of the creature in that domain, not the weakest! The weak parts of the herd get culled out, they\u2019re being deprived of their capital, they\u2019re being squeezed out. You see it with the Mt. Gox disaster \u2014 anything that doesn\u2019t quite work. And so this asset class is a living asset class. And it\u2019s strength comes from the fact that it\u2019s being developed \u2014 it\u2019s not constrained by the lowest common denominator, it\u2019s strengthened by the highest common denominator! If there\u2019s somebody in the world, if there\u2019s an exchange in the world that can actually do this better, faster, stronger and it comes onto the Bitcoin network, they will set the price. Even if you\u2019re just HODLing, if you\u2019re just sitting there holding an asset \u2014 let\u2019s say I\u2019m HODLing $100 Million of Bitcoin and I\u2019m wishing it would go up in value. And then let\u2019s say there\u2019s a million kazillion laws in the United States that prevent people from trading index futures on Bitcoin. But somebody in Malta is able to do it, or somebody in Singapore is able to launch that exchange. So Singapore launches an exchange that matches billions of dollars of forward index buyers or option buyers to billions of dollars of call buyers, and that attracts tens of billions of dollars of capital in the market because it solves the yield curve problem. Let\u2019s say hypothetically somebody on a centralized or decentralized or Lightning Network exchange solves the yield curve problem. If I could give you 8% risk-free yield on 10-year money, presumably you can take $100 Billion and you can take that money and you can short fiat. Short the dollar, go long the Bitcoin, squeeze the 8% yield on $100 Billion, make yourself $8 Billion a year. If you can figure out how to do that in Singapore, you set up in Singapore, you do it in Singapore \u2014 what happens to the price of Bitcoin? Goes up! What happens to the HODLer sitting in Schenectady, New York \u2014 that never did anything, that didn\u2019t touch it, that doesn\u2019t know about it, that doesn\u2019t understand it \u2014 with their little 1 Bitcoin?"}

They all have that immunity. That\u2019s herd immunity, whatever that might be. And that\u2019s the beauty of Bitcoin. I had this Tweet\u2014I put it out there, I said, You know, lions get tired of chasing the antelope. Lions complain to the ranger. The ranger hobbles the antelope. Lions get fat, dumb, and happy. Antelope all die. Lions all die. Ranger blames it on the weather! And that is a metaphor for a lot of stuff. Generally it\u2019s a metaphor for how you destroy a crypto network by trying to make transaction fees lower. It\u2019s like, Someone complained about transaction fees so we tried to change everything to drive the transaction fees down because somehow it\u2019s an abomination in the eyes of God that people get charged for transactions! The antelope ran too fast! Not fair! Slow them down! The transaction fees were too high! Not fair! Make them lower! We\u2019ll hobble them for you. Okay? It\u2019s also a metaphor for interest rates. Interest rates are too high! I can\u2019t afford a loan! Make them go down! It\u2019s also a metaphor for competition. My competitor goes too fast! They\u2019re making it too difficult! Slow them down! Make the foreigners stop that! Make somebody do something! Right? It\u2019s somebody trying to regulate or manage something because they think it\u2019s a problem. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re messing with Mother Nature. You\u2019re in a war with Nature\u2014it\u2019s not gonna end well. At the end of the day lazy lions should die, and slow antelope get eaten, and fast, strong, healthy antelope procreate, and fast, strong, healthy lions feed, and the lions get better, and the antelope get better, and they live in an ecosystem.

That is one of the things that\u2019s gotten us into the situation that we\u2019re in today with low and negative interest rates. We\u2019ve constantly tried to introduce an economic analgesic to paper over the business cycle or paper over losses.

Entropy is at [work]\u2014 time must move forward. Trying to drive interest rates to zero or negative is a war on time. You\u2019re trying to make time go backwards! You\u2019re trying to make water flow uphill. You\u2019re trying to reverse gravity. You\u2019re trying to reverse the laws of thermodynamics. It\u2019s me saying to you, Robert, will you give me everything that you own \u2014 give it to me \u2014 you go without, I\u2019m going to keep it, and when you die I\u2019m going to give a third of it back to your heirs!

No rational person would say, I\u2019m gonna give you everything I have in return for half of it back when I\u2019m dead. It\u2019s so moronic it\u2019s just insane! And so when I\u2019m trying to drive the interest rate to zero or negative, I\u2019m actually trying to reverse time and make it run backwards. I\u2019m first trying to stop it, and then trying to make it run backwards. I\u2019m trying to reverse entropy. I\u2019m trying to put the genie back in the bottle.

We\u2019re back to this issue of: Zoom was inevitable. YouTube was inevitable. Virtual business models were inevitable. Bitcoin was inevitable. But it sure did get accelerated by certain things that happened! Bitcoin had 10 years of I would say a 7% forcing function with the dollar, and it got goosed a bit harder with Argentina and other developing world countries and, you know, the anxieties of Syria and the anxieties of Iraq and the anxiety in Africa and the anxiety in South America and the like, so those stressors \u2014 that goosed it. And the currency wars pushed it a bit harder. And then I think the pandemic crisis lit it on fire! I could say Robert, like, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m talking to you if there\u2019s no pandemic! But I don\u2019t think for a second that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t be successful without me, and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s gonna stop it, but I do think there is an avalanche of energy \u2014 individuals and corporations \u2014 that got inspired and driven into this ecosystem because of the pandemic.

And that war on money as a store of value creates massive dislocations in the bond market and the equity market, and there are consequences to everything. Ultimately, Bitcoin is an antifragile but scalable platform serving as a store of value.

Bitcoin is an incredible store of value. I think that\u2019s its primary use case, or its killer value proposition now and probably for the next decade \u2014 maybe forever! The entire world is looking for a store of value right now, and you have to look across $250 Trillion of assets. If we think that asset inflation is running north of 10% \u2014 and I think it is, I think it\u2019s pretty clear it is \u2014 and if you have capital, you have to choose between bonds, $80 Trillion in sovereign debt or corporate debt or municipal debt, or mortgage-backed securities, or you gotta choose equities, tech equity, conventional equity, or you gotta go to precious metals, or you go to real property, real estate property. And when you look at all of those things, the problem is half of all real estate is impaired because of the political response to COVID, and it\u2019s not likely that\u2019s gonna change in the next 10 years. We\u2019ve probably got 10 years of uncertainty about real estate assets, especially commercial real estate assets. The other challenge with real estate is the taxes on it. It\u2019s illiquid, immobile, and highly taxed. Generally real estate is taxed annually everywhere, it\u2019s just a question of whether it\u2019s 20 basis points or 200 basis points. So that makes real estate a challenging store of value. And that takes you to bonds: Bonds have worked as a store of value when the interest rates keep going lower. You can see that everybody that\u2019s been on the bond train and benefiting from it, they\u2019re screaming as loud as they can: They want negative interest rates! Because they\u2019re like \u2014 The secret to success is lower the interest rates 50 basis points a year or 100 basis points a year and it\u2019s a no-lose proposition \u2014 for them. But at this point it\u2019s getting kind of ridiculous silly because when interest rates go negative everybody takes their money out of the bank, it creates bank runs, all the bank systems break. It\u2019s kind of a morally bankrupt \u2014 I mean a lot of people, they don\u2019t really understand that they\u2019re being abused at 2% instead of 5%. But pretty much everybody can figure out that when you\u2019re being billed 1% of the money you have at a bank, you\u2019re being abused!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-7-5nUwegcuAz3/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 7 | The Virtues of Strong Money", "text": "Michael Saylor [28:02]: Yeah so that doesn\u2019t work, and so where does that take us? It takes us to equity. We\u2019ve got an equity bubble that\u2019s a very crowded trade, but the real issue with equity as a store of value is that the revenue gets taxed as sales tax, the cash flows get taxed as income tax, the expenses \u2014 the cost structure gets taxed as employee and payroll tax. Then the trade gets taxed \u2014 there\u2019s a tariff. Then you have the existential threat or regulatory risk of onerous regulations. Pick up the paper and see maybe Australia\u2019s gonna bill Google every time they link to a newspaper article, and then if Google doesn\u2019t link the newspaper articles they\u2019re gonna get fined for not linking the newspaper articles! And as these things become more powerful, they become regulated utilities and politicians start to think that they can and should be regulated \u2014 and maybe with good cause! If there\u2019s only one provider of information anywhere in the country then it definitely becomes a political issue. So that\u2019s the challenge with equities: they might work for 2, 3, 4 years, but they\u2019re valued as a multiple of cash flows. So if all of the liquidity of the civilization gets squeezed out of debt \u2014 when interest gets to zero \u2014 the government and the Fed owns all the debt. Okay, they bought me out \u2014 now I gotta put it in something else so I jump on equities so now equities double. But now the P/Es double or triple, and the revenue multiples triple. What\u2019s the value of an equity? The value of equity should in theory be tangible assets on the balance sheet plus the sum of the discounted cash flows. And so people are using equities as store of value today. In fact you could make the argument that equities are the most popular store of value for the majority with their Robinhood trading \u2014 they\u2019re all buying Apple, Amazon, Facebook, NASDAQ, SPDRs \u2014 everybody! Even though nobody thinks revenues are going up this year, nobody thinks earnings are going up this year, but equity values have doubled this year. Well that means that they\u2019re getting riskier! So if you contrast Bitcoin to equity, the problem is: if the price of an equity goes up by a factor of 10, you\u2019ve got more risk because it\u2019s delaminating from its underlying cash flows and its fundamentals. Because it is a centralized, regulated entity, and the only way that the cash flows are going to grow into that value is they keep raising the price. And if they\u2019re a monopoly and the raise the price, the regulators will react. If they don\u2019t raise the price, they can\u2019t grow into the multiple! And so you kind of have a chicken and the egg thing, right? And if there\u2019s any competition and their cash flows deteriorate, eventually you\u2019re trading at 200:1 or 200 P/E, and then any degree of disappointment causes massive volatility. And how are they different than Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is the liquidity, it is the store of value \u2014 that is it! If you\u2019re going to function as money, you want to be a single-celled organism \u2014 like the algae of the ecosystem. The base layer of the ecosystem that\u2019s plankton or bacteria or single cells. You don\u2019t want to be a vertebrate! And these companies are vertebrates with a brain and a backbone, and that means \u2014 for example, WeChat or TikTok has a headquarters \u2014 and if it\u2019s in the wrong country, it gets its head chopped off. And Apple and Facebook, they\u2019re subject to a certain court, a certain country\u2019s jurisdiction. So that means they\u2019re foreigners somewhere else! They\u2019re vertebrate. If you\u2019re a vertebrate, I can kill you with a needle. A human being I can figure out how to kill: there\u2019s a heart, I take a needle, I poke there \u2014 you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re very fragile. Hard to do that with a swarm of hornets. Hard to do that with all the plankton in the ocean. It\u2019s very difficult to do it with an amorphous decentralized invertebrate of some sort. So if you want a store of value, you don\u2019t want a company that\u2019s valued based upon the ability to engineer hyper-complicated products that have to keep getting upgraded. You want something which is simple, that can just keep things simple. This is again where some of the crypto-enthusiasts, they keep wanting to tinker with a better blockchain, a better crypto. You know, they never saw an upgrade they didn\u2019t like so they just wanna keep revving it every year. Like it\u2019s the iPhone version 37. There\u2019s a fundamental difference, which is: if there\u2019s a bug in the iPhone version 37, everybody in the world\u2019s heart doesn\u2019t stop!"}

I think this analogy you\u2019re using with the simplicity of plankton being the base layer for the ecosystem is apt. I want to say plankton makes up the majority of the biomass on the planet by a pretty substantial margin because it\u2019s so simple and it\u2019s so efficient at converting solar energy into biological energy. And then it is the base layer for this multiplicity of layered ecosystem that we have in the world. And another thing I think is interesting is that you make a great point that equities are becoming more risky as they increase in price, because they\u2019re delaminating from their valuation fundamentals as you said. And Bitcoin\u2019s the opposite. Actually the more valuable Bitcoin is, the more secure it\u2019s network, the greater the liquidity, the more resistant it is to attack. So it\u2019s a very interesting counter-trade to equities as a store of value."}

Just to give the listeners a little bit of context for via negativa \u2014 for those who haven\u2019t read Taleb: His canonical example in his book The Black Swan where you can see as many white swans as you want, but you can never prove by virtue of that evidence that all swans are white, but with a single sighting of a black swan you have disproven that all swans are white. So the moral of the story is that disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. And I think that\u2019s getting to your point here is that it\u2019s getting stronger by taking away. Your factual base on which you\u2019re building your premise and strategy in the world is strengthened by disconfirmation moreso than it is by confirmation."}

That\u2019s a truly great piece of software: You ask the wrong question and it gives you the right answer because it knows which question you should\u2019ve asked and it knows how you should\u2019ve spelled it and said, We\u2019re gonna answer this question for you instead because the odds that you really wanted to know this question answered is 99,000,000:1! The odds that you really were asking a unique question that seems foolish and misspelling a popular name while you\u2019re asking it\u2014that\u2019s 1 in a billion! So if you really wanted to ask the wrong question the wrong way you try it twice, but 99.999% of the time they give you the right answer to the wrong question and they do it because they built this very fault-tolerant, common-sense, rational interface. So back to store of value, right? Bitcoin is an ideal store of value because it\u2019s got the ability to convey your energy not across 10,000 miles but across 10,000 days. 30 years into the future. 100 years into the future. Most people when they\u2019re investing in assets, they\u2019re taking this very short term view of like the next month, the next year, the next two years, and I find that if you\u2019re looking at a 3-year time frame, everything gets very very noisy and complicated and there\u2019s all these debates. But if you really want to end the debates, go out to 100 years and just take $100 Million and go through the exercise of giving it to someone \u2014 your heir\u2019s heir\u2019s heir in 100 years. And then all of a sudden, all this noise drops away. Can I put it into real estate? No, it\u2019ll be taxed out of existence in 100 years. Can I put it in gold? No, 98% of it will be gone if 100% of it isn\u2019t gone in 100 years because we mine it to death. Can I put it into fiat? No it\u2019s gonna be inflated to death. Can I invest it in a company? No, name one company that\u2019s around today that was around 100 years ago that hasn\u2019t been diluted, recapitalized, etc. Can I put it in a stock index? Well, you\u2019re trusting a human being to rebalance the index over and over again. What stock index do you trust for the next 100 years? And by the way it\u2019s got counterparty risk at the nation state level. The nation might not be there, and 90% didn\u2019t make it! So what are you left with? And the truth is, when you just do that thought experiment it\u2019s pretty obvious: You would put it in a crypto network, in a decentralized proof of work network if the adherents \u2014 the maximalists \u2014 were fanatic zealots about protecting the integrity of the network against meddlers who would screw it up. If the network is supported by those with a religious conviction to the network such that you could imagine 100 years from now there will still be people protecting the network \u2014 the phrase is, Keepers of the flame. Every great religion, every great institution has keepers of the flame, and there must be passion. Do you believe in your religion? Do you believe strong enough that you\u2019ll flee persecution to continue to practice it? The United States was built on the foundation of separation of church and state, and it\u2019s a pretty important and interesting metaphor: People came here because they could practice their religion! That\u2019s why they came here! And they came here because their religion was above their government. They would not sacrifice whatever it is they believed in. If you look at every institution that lasts more than 100 years \u2014 name them: Harvard University, Cambridge, Oxford, the Catholic Church, Islamic sects, the Jewish faith \u2014 there\u2019s not that many! There\u2019s churches or religious sects and then there\u2019s some educational institutions \u2014 and I see the educational institutions being shaken at their core this year! I mean literally you could\u2019ve said for 500 years \u2014 Ivy Leagues, the elite universities \u2014 they\u2019re stalwart institutions. They have lost a huge amount of credibility this year! When you send all of your students home and you close the campus and people are studying virtually, people\u2019s affiliation to the bricks and mortar of the institution has been dramatically weakened unless they morph into a virtual institution. The virtual institutions by the way have dramatically strengthened, right? Your affiliation with YouTube and Facebook and Apple TV and Bitcoin and Square Cash has dramatically strengthened. If it\u2019s virtual. And your affiliation with the bricks and mortar physical institution has been weakened. And those that will survive have dematerialized and virtualized and they\u2019ve learned how to project their ethos in cyberspace. So yeah, back to the store of value: You need people \u2014 human beings, flesh and blood people \u2014 that are going to keep the flame. And the flame of Bitcoin is the node and the mining rig. We\u2019re getting into Bitcoin as religion or as faith now, but imagine 1,000 years ago, I want to keep a religion alive \u2014 I have an altar in my home. Every wealthy person had a chapel in their home. If you look at religions, go to the Far East, there are altars in Buddhist, Shinto, other faiths. So the idea of an altar or a shrine or a cathedral or a church \u2014 these are structures where people go to worship, and the worshiping is the feeding of the flame. And oftentimes during the worshiping they\u2019re tithing and they\u2019re channeling 10% of their money as energy into these religions in order to keep them relevant! If you look at fantasy fiction, in fantasy where they have gods, the strength of the god is a function of the devoutness of the worshipers, of the followers. Such and such was worshiped as the god of the forest, and they are worshiped as the god of the forest and all of their adherents \u2014 all their acolytes \u2014 are feeding energy to the god of the forest. And when they\u2019re no longer worshiped, their energy goes away! If you lose your faithful, if they won\u2019t feed you with the fire of truth, with the energy that you need, your efficacy falls and you die. And so how do you feed a fire, right? If it\u2019s a physical fire you have to throw wood on the fire. How do you feed a religion? You have to tithe \u2014 the Catholic Church, or any church \u2014 you have to give it money, and maybe you have to give it your life service. Onward Christian soldiers! I will fight for the cause. I will donate to the cause. That\u2019s how you feed a religious institution. How do you feed a crypto network? You gotta spin up facilities of encrypted energy that adhere to the protocol. Every time a miner comes onboard it\u2019s feeding the fire. Every time a node comes onboard it\u2019s gonna certify and validate. It\u2019s protecting. It\u2019s creating one more chain in the fault-tolerance structure. And that\u2019s why a smaller crypto \u2014 a crypto that\u2019s a technical experiment, that\u2019s an application \u2014 isn\u2019t the good store of value. Because if the people are willing to fork it, if they\u2019re willing to fork it and abandon it in order to [move to 48:44] a new technology, then the flame dies. And so it\u2019s pretty clear that Bitcoin maximalists, they have a lot of the faith and the conviction of true believers in any religious faith for the past 2,000 years. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Because they share the same values. Their values are: Truth, Nature, Natural Laws, Laws of Physics, Laws of Thermodynamics, Math, Austrian Economics, No such thing as a free lunch, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology Advances. They share those values. They\u2019re taking their monetary energy and tokenizing it on a Bitcoin network with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is that single shared store of value. If money is energy and energy begets life and a crypto decentralized network gives you sovereignty, that\u2019s a path to immortality, and that means that everybody in the Bitcoin community that believes in this for the long term is engaged in the pursuit of immortal life. And pursuit of immortal life sounds like a religious mantra, I think! And I grew up in the Southern Baptist faith so I\u2019m very familiar with the ideology of Christianity and pursuit of immortal life is pretty paramount there."}

And so all religious traditions, mythological traditions, are stories pointing toward a higher truth. And I find it interesting that Bitcoin has higher truth embedded in code! This 21 Million number is quite literally transcendental: We can\u2019t touch it, we can\u2019t change it, we can\u2019t do anything about it. Every 10 minutes it\u2019s promulgating the most indisputable truth that we\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s true global consensus.

So the solution there is: You move from 3 years to 10 years, and then you move from 10 years to 100 years. And at the 100-year time frame it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s an asset and what\u2019s a store of value! And it\u2019s just very obvious: (A) Bitcoin is a store of value if its believers have religious conviction in it. It becomes very simple. Now, if you step out to a 1,000-year time frame and you say, What\u2019s this thing gotta be in order to last 1,000 years? It better be the worship of Math and the Laws of Thermodynamics and the Laws of Physics and Einstein and Newton! That might make it! And if we just focus upon that and don\u2019t let all this other stuff get mired \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s reasonable! People have been studying and honoring Math and Algebra for 2,000 years, they\u2019ve been honoring Calculus for 400 years. You could say this is truly the adoption of economics as a science. It\u2019s that critical inflection point where economics went from being a political preference to being a science, and if you adopt it as a science then you actually get massive advantages technically. And if you reject it, I guess it\u2019s kind of like the guys in the Dark Ages and they could accept Calculus or they could reject Calculus."}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-7-5nUwegcuAz3/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 7 | The Virtues of Strong Money", "text": "Robert Breedlove [58:24]: Alright guys! That was Episode 7 with Michael Saylor here on the Saylor Series. And wow what an episode! We have gone really deep into the topic of Bitcoin and I think we had a really strong finish today. So I\u2019m just gonna run through a few of the things we talked about. We started out with this concept of Bitcoin as a monetary missile, and this took me back to Episode 1 when we were talking about fire, missiles, and hydraulics being these primary Stone Age technologies that allowed mankind to come into dominance in the world. And I thought the analogy was very interesting that, using Bitcoin we have this ultimate high ground behind a wall of encrypted energy, but we can also accelerate our monetary energy and deploy it anywhere in the world across any domain nearly instantly with virtually no frictions at all. And so not only does it give us this advantage of asymmetric terrain, but we also get maximal force with how we deploy that monetary energy in the generation of capital. So I thought that was a super-apt analogy. And then we talked about how that effectively makes Bitcoin the highest bandwidth price discovery, transparency, and security asset in the world. So we have this pure money that propagates pure price signals so it would allow for pure price discovery \u2014 all of that is premised on the open source ethos, which is essentially just absolute transparency \u2014 and that gives it the ultimate security. So there\u2019s a bit of a paradox there, it\u2019s that: By being totally open to inspection, Bitcoin actually resists manipulation or emulation even, in that everything about it is out in the open. So it\u2019s more a quality of its network effects, its liquidity, its first-mover advantage, even actually the disappearance of Satoshi which we\u2019ll get into a little bit later \u2014 all of these things sort of wrap this open technology in an apparently disruption-proof casing. So I thought that was a really powerful discussion point. And Saylor calls Bitcoin, The creature that never sleeps. We have this swarm intelligence, if you will, that never stops growing, changing, adapting, trading \u2014 it is just a fully autonomous and perpetual monetary network competing against these other monetary networks that are rigidly controlled in certain time windows. And to his point, an individual organism has to sleep, but a swarm creature does not! So the swarm creature necessarily out-competes the individual organism because it doesn\u2019t need to sleep. It just keeps adapting, growing, becoming more fit. And as we know from Darwin, it\u2019s the most fit competitor that wins out in an ecosystem. And I thought this was a great point too and I never thought of it this way, that: In a swarm, the weakest elements are actually weeded out. So it\u2019s constantly sacrificing its weaker elements to natural selection and thereby strengthening the ensemble. Whereas the individual organism is subject to any singular attack vector. If its defense is penetrated, the whole entity or organism is lost. [1:02:17] So in that way centralized entities are only as strong as their weakest link, or as Saylor says, Are constrained by their lowest common denominator. Whereas a decentralized entity like the swarm is gonna be strengthened by its highest common denominator. So we can think about this as kind of like something that learns at the edges. So if one member of the swarm figures out how to effectively deal with a predator or a threat, then it will tend to reproduce and its genes will be replicated into the rest of the swarm. So the entire decentralized entity or organism is actually learning at the edges and incorporating those lessons into its whole body. Whereas the centralized entity, if it encounters a predator it doesn\u2019t know how to deal with or even figures out how to defeat, it doesn\u2019t spread that adaptivity to the rest of its body, essentially. It\u2019s just a one-to-one relationship versus the one-to-many. So the one-to-many gives it just much more intelligence and adaptivity in the long run. And tying this back to Bitcoin, it\u2019s as if \u2014 to Saylor\u2019s point \u2014 any market participant in the Bitcoin network figures out a way to deliver a solution smarter, faster, stronger, better, that\u2019s where the capital will flow! Because again, the capital is unrestricted. It is not siloed to any particular jurisdiction or institution \u2014 individuals have maximal sovereignty over their Bitcoin capital so they can move it anywhere in the world. So in his example of: Say someone is setting up a centralized or decentralized institution in Singapore for instance that solves the yield curve problem \u2014 so matching lenders and borrowers of Bitcoin in a way that establishes a long term yield curve for Bitcoin \u2014 that this would create all of a sudden this risk-free rate on Bitcoin which is the one thing that it lacks, as we discussed in earlier episodes, to make it a truly pristine collateral that would be competitive to say US Treasuries. So Bitcoin currently just doesn\u2019t have a yield. But if you could match borrowers and lenders you could actually create that curve. So his point was, Say we create this 8% risk-free rate on Bitcoin on 10-year money which could be used\u2014and you have fiat deprecating at say 2% a year best-case \u2014 then all of a sudden this opens up an attack vector on fiat where you could actually go long Bitcoin and short the Dollar and squeeze the difference in yield. This is called a speculative attack. And this would have the effect of strengthening the speculative attacker himself, but it would also strengthen the HODLer in Schenectady or in whatever town that doesn\u2019t know anything about this, just by virtue of more price appreciation pressure being applied to Bitcoin. So more energy being drawn into the network actually benefits all network participants! And this is contrary to a centralized entity. And if you flip this back to the Great Wall of China example, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve inverted that security model. So whereas the Great Wall of China \u2014 it\u2019s just a perimeter defense, it doesn\u2019t adapt, and if you can penetrate at any point of it the whole defensible area is lost, that\u2019s actually what happened when the Mongols penetrated the gate\u2014whereas Bitcoin is effectively this swarm intelligence. So any network participant that can figure something out is benefiting the entire network, and then you\u2019ve also further capitalized or further energized those network participants to go out and solve other problems on behalf of other network participants. So there\u2019s this virtuous cycle built right into it that just does not exist with any other form of money. [1:06:33] Then we take a bit of a pivot and we got into how human intervention negatively and adversely impacts complex systems. And Saylor gave the example of the lions complaining that the antelopes are too fast so the hunter hobbles the antelope. The lions kill all of the antelope, get lazy because they aren\u2019t being pushed to their limits, so then after all the antelope are eliminated, the lions starve to death and then the hunter blames it on the weather! This is a core concept in Talebs\u2019 books where he says that human intervention moves us from what he calls Mediocristan to Extremistan. Meaning essentially that the non-linearity of effects goes through the roof once we try to intervene in natural systems, because there are all these dynamic equilibria that we\u2019re unaware of. And when we offset, when we try and press one lever to cause one result, there\u2019s a cascade of unintended consequences surrounding that. One common example here is called the Cobra problem. And you can look this up on, say, Wikipedia, but the gist of it is that \u2014 I forget what country \u2014 but they had a problem with an overpopulation of cobras, so they passed a law that offered a ransom for every dead cobra brought to the government \u2014 they\u2019d give you $10 \u2014 whatever it was. And this had the unintended consequence of incentivizing people to actually start breeding cobras and killing them and then to take them into the government and get this reward! So it actually further exacerbated the overpopulation problem and financially compromised the local government. So that\u2019s just one example where good intentions go awry, and history is just full of these! So tying that back into money: I guess you could say the central bank or interest rate manipulation \u2014 intentionality aside \u2014 we could possibly argue that it was done with the attempt to make things better. You can argue both sides of that. Let\u2019s just say for instance that it was done with good and wholesome intentions to benefit the economy or stimulate demand or keep prices stable and unemployment low and predictable and all these things. That still \u2014 when you\u2019re talking about suppressing interest rates to induce money creation and borrowing \u2014 you\u2019re going to war with the temporal and energetic principles of thermodynamics, because again the price of money\u2014the interest rate \u2014 is the price of time! I\u2019m gonna give you money now that you\u2019re gonna give me back later. There\u2019s a price associated with that which you\u2019re paying me\u2014it\u2019s called the interest rate. If a centralized body is artificially suppressing that, you\u2019re actually trying to \u2014 and what Saylor said \u2014 was to reverse the flow of time. You\u2019re discounting the price of time! And this has just so many disastrous unintended consequences around it! Which we went into. You\u2019re pushing back against thermodynamics, which is the inviolable rule set of the universe. And I would argue that, actually, trying to suppress the price of time causes us to discount the value of our own time and the time of others. You could say time or energy, actually. And I think that is kind of the culprit at the heart of this moral hazard related to fiat currencies, is that we\u2019re discounting time and energy, which is the intrinsic value of human beings, effectively. And that\u2019s the one case by the way where I use the term intrinsic value, because I do think humans are the only intrinsically valued \u2014 you could probably expand that to life more generally \u2014 but there\u2019s no objects that have intrinsic value, value is subjective, but life itself as living beings, that seems to be an absolute is that we should have value for life! Anyways, bit of a philosophical aside. And in that way this organism aspect \u2014 actually discounting the value of life \u2014 we see all the moral hazard that central banking has created, all the warfare its funded, it\u2019s as if Bitcoin is an autoimmune response, somehow, from society to central banking. As Saylor said, clearly the message in the Genesis Block solidifies that. And he goes a little bit deeper actually to say that Satoshi was clearly an individual sensitive to these negative socioeconomic consequences of central banking, and his own sensitivity was a response to the sensitivity of others: People who had been marginalized or victimized by the system throughout the ages. You could call that a form of inflammation, basically, in the socioeconomic super-organism. And then Satoshi was just the cell of the organism that figured it out! He figured out the correct response, launched it into the world in the right way at the right time. So I thought that was just really interesting. And Brandon Quittem \u2014 I talked to him about the Fourth Turning. He made the point \u2014 and I haven\u2019t actually read this book yet \u2014 but he made the point that in these long cycles, there\u2019s First, Second, Third, Fourth Turnings, there tends to come a kind of pivotal moment or innovation or something that comes just at the right time to reverse course. And it feels and seems like Bitcoin is definitely becoming that in the modern age! The world is just going in one direction on central banking and we needed some autoimmune response and it appears Bitcoin is that! Then we got into Bitcoin as a store of value. I think he made very strong arguments \u2014 especially when you zoom out to a 100+ year time frame \u2014 that Bitcoin is basically the sole 21st Century store of value. It just is incomparable to anything else. And this 2020 war on currency and escalating government overreach, this has just pushed an awareness of Bitcoin on people and sort of accelerated that autoimmune response in a way. And to just compare it real quick, because we went through alternative stores of value, you have bonds, but they\u2019re not bumping up against the zero-bound, and to Saylor\u2019s point, it\u2019s harder to discern when you\u2019re being taken advantage of when the natural interest rate is 5% and you\u2019re getting 2%, but it\u2019s much easier for market participants to understand that they\u2019re getting screwed when there\u2019s a negative yield. There\u2019s something very special about crossing that zero barrier and that\u2019s where bonds are at today. And they are getting quickly decimated as a viable store of value because there\u2019s no yield. Equities, they\u2019re way overvalued across all fundamentals and valuation metrics \u2014 historic all-time highs, P/E ratios, multiples on EBITDA or enterprise value, etc. And that is\u2014what I would argue as a Bitcoiner \u2014 is a function of: we\u2019ve compromised the store of value function of fiat currency, so that function is now \u2014 the market\u2019s figuring out it needs to assign that function to any other asset! And equities are somewhat reliably scarce at least. But this has a perverse effect in that\u2014as Saylor says \u2014 the price of equities are delaminating from their fundamentals. So they\u2019re overvalued in the marketplace. And they\u2019re actually becoming more and more risky. There\u2019s this perverse effect of: the more we use an equity as a store of value, the less effective it is as a store of value in the long run, which is really strange. And Bitcoin is the opposite of that! Bitcoin is actually becoming more secure as a store of value as its price increases, and therefore more attractive. And this is an economic concept called a Veblen good, which you could look up, but basically there are certain assets that the demand tends to increase as the price increases, which is contrary to most other assets. But I think Bitcoin fits that category. Commodities are another alternative \u2014 we destroyed those in earlier episodes as Saylor checked those out. And finally real estate, which has been a really popular one for the past 50 years especially in the US \u2014 real estate cannot be hidden and it\u2019s being taxed every year. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to tax because you can\u2019t hide it, and that is the dominion on which the government projects its power. So I think there\u2019s really high valuations there, plus there\u2019s no concealability so that sort of compromises real estate as a good store of value. He makes the point that, to be a good store of value, you really want to have a technology that\u2019s focused on that function. Equities, you\u2019re creating all kinds of other value in the economy, granted albeit riskily \u2014 they\u2019re taking on risk and trying new ventures and figuring things out and innovating. Property would be probably be a little more stable but it still has other uses \u2014 there\u2019s actually a utility use there. So the point being: You want the pure store of value. That\u2019s what gold effectively was \u2014 it was the purest store of value we had historically. [1:17:03] And now that\u2019s what Bitcoin is today. And we could say it\u2019s kind of like being a single-celled organism. As Saylor said, You don\u2019t want to be a vertebrate with all these complex features, because the additional features open you up to more risk and attack surface. What you want is something very unidimensional, single-cell, just holds value in a trust-minimized way across time and space. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is! That is the big breakthrough! And that led us into via negativa, which is another Talebian concept that I really like. And in a way this ties back to a quote that Saylor Tweeted once. He said, A designer knows he has achieved perfection when there is nothing left to take away. And as we discussed previously, money has 5 properties: divisibility, durability, recognizability, portability, scarcity. So what did Satoshi do in the creation of Bitcoin? The reason it\u2019s so genius, and the reason Satoshi\u2019s an artist, and the reason Bitcoin is effectively a perfected money is because Satoshi took away all of the indivisibility, all of the decomposability, all of the unrecognizability, all of the immovability, and all of the unpredictability from money! Right? He maximally removed all of these negative aspects of money to deliver us the quasi-perfection that is Bitcoin. And that speaks again to this minimization of attack surface. You\u2019ve reduced all of the features of money to strip it down to its bare bones. Just its bare monetary properties. And you\u2019ve taken away all the negative aspects from those properties, so you\u2019ve effectively perfected those properties. And this speaks again to Bitcoin\u2019s resistance to disruption! We\u2019ve achieved attack surface minimization via monetary property optimization. So this is via negativa! The more you take away, what you have left becomes more valuable, essentially. And another way to say that is: We commonly hear that, Oh, this new crypto-asset can do this or that that Bitcoin can\u2019t do! But the lesser feature set of Bitcoin is a feature itself, not a bug! Because it\u2019s whole value prop is survivability. It cannot be stopped. It is just perfected store of value that adheres to 21 Million and no one can shut down the network. No political or military action can shut down the network. That is the core value prop of Bitcoin. That is what it optimizes for. [1:20:05] And as Saylor puts this \u2014 again in one of his Tweets \u2014 he says, Bitcoin has no country, has no company, has no competitor. So that\u2019s what makes it so special, is that it\u2019s something that actually exists beyond us, which turns out to be really important! And I would add to that too that Bitcoin has no identified creator. We know it\u2019s Satoshi but no one knows who Satoshi is. We don\u2019t have his person to point toward. And the absence of that personality \u2014 the creator \u2014I would say actually gives Bitcoin mythological bedrock, which really underpins its decentralization. If we knew who Satoshi was and he was in the news every day, he was out getting drunk at the bar or something and everyone knew he had a million coins, it would just open him up to a lot of attacks and call a lot of things into question that his disappearance basically nullified. So this godhead of Bitcoin we call Satoshi I think really reinforces the value proposition of survivability and decentralization. And that gets us into what I thought was the most interesting part of the discussion today! And that was when Saylor pointed to the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a contributing factor to the value of the Bitcoin network. And I love the analogy where the defenders of 21 Million effectively \u2014 the network participants themselves \u2014 we are the keepers of the flame. We are the mythological keepers of the flame. The point being there: to preserve an institution adequately over time, you need adherents or fanatics if you will that are so convicted in their belief that they\u2019re willing to flee persecution to preserve the institution. And he drew the analogy to people coming to the US. People came to the US largely to practice religious freedom. People wanted a refuge that they could freely put their spiritual preferences above politics, and the US provided that. Then to bring it forward a bit, we\u2019re seeing the faith shaken in existing institutions worldwide, whether it\u2019s your government, your bank\u2014all these legacy institutions \u2014faith has been severely shaken, especially in the wake of COVID. Saylor made a great point: even at the universities where no one\u2019s going to campus anymore and they\u2019re taking their classes online, you\u2019re reducing the affiliation with a brick and mortar university, and you\u2019re strengthening the affiliation with the digital university. So the institutions and companies and brands that adapt to the digital age more quickly will actually benefit more at the expense of legacy institutions. So that\u2019s a mega-political trend that\u2019s under way. And the flame for Bitcoin, if you will, is kept between the nodes, the miners, and the HODLers, which are basically preserving this dynamic equilibrium centered on 21 Million. And I love this analogy of worshiping at the altar, where people in the past all worshiped at the altar, they would actually feed the flame even by tithing say 10% of their income. So they\u2019re funding this religious institution \u2014 they\u2019re also preaching these values to their contemporaries or their kids, so they\u2019re passing these values forward in time using both money and language, which I thought was very interesting. And ritual \u2014 I would add to that! So in the Bitcoin world we\u2019ve gotten miners energizing the fire. They\u2019re adding additional energy to the network that is its security budget, effectively. You have nodes protecting the fire, which are basically selecting the rule set that the miners are enforcing. And then we have the HODLers themselves which are the fire! They\u2019re the living flame that\u2019s centered around 21 Million, so it\u2019s like this group of people, this social layer, that\u2019s all oriented to preserving 21 Million which benefits everyone and intertwines everyone\u2019s fate. And each one of those is just another element in this composite fault-tolerant structure that we call Bitcoin. So it\u2019s this radically new way to think about it as more of a religious-like institution. And maybe you could even say that nodes, miners, and HODLers are kind of like the Holy Trinity of Bitcoin. Maybe 21 Million is the God or something that they\u2019re oriented around. Might be a stretch, but I thought I\u2019d mention that nonetheless. So Bitcoin as religion \u2014 the question comes naturally: What are its values? And Saylor declares: Truth, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology, Self-Sovereignty \u2014 all of these things are embedded in the value system of true Bitcoiners, and they carry that into the world in their word, in their deed, in their investments. And I just can\u2019t think of a more robust, powerful, effective, well-organized group of people in the world than the Bitcoiners I\u2019ve interacted with! I\u2019ve said it before: There\u2019s nothing in the world that makes me more bullish on Bitcoin than Bitcoiners. And again, if we go back to the purpose of Man or at least what distinguishes him and what makes him superior to the other animals, it\u2019s our ability to channel energy across space and time. And I love Saylor\u2019s point: Energy begets life. So Bitcoin is being this tool for immortalizing the channeling of energy. We can channel it across space and time in any direction we want with essentially no loss. That 21 Million \u2014 or Bitcoin itself \u2014 it\u2019s actually in a way kind of the pursuit of immortal life. We\u2019re pursuing a medium that maximally preserves energy across space and time. So it\u2019s like, Pfft, well of course it\u2019s a religious institution\u2014we\u2019re pursuing immortal life! Not immortal life in the sense that you live forever, but a network or institution that lives forever for the betterment of all, and one in which you can project your own wills and values beyond your own life. The example there was the Saylor Foundation, which is: his value \u2014 Saylor\u2019s own personal value system \u2014 is free education for all. He thinks that is something that\u2019s really important for the human race, and now with Bitcoin he has a way to finance and project those values beyond his own life. He can now do something to fund and strengthen this institution beyond his own life in a way that was not possible before Bitcoin, and you could say that this is a way of him projecting values and willpower and intentions and preferences into his own afterlife, if you will. It doesn\u2019t mean Heaven, but just beyond his own life. And then we touched on another religious aspect of this: it\u2019s that 21 Million is truly transcendent. It is something no one can do anything about. And I think that speaks to its religious qualities in a way as well. He had this great quote, it said: If you worship Science, the Laws of Physics, Thermodynamics, and Mathematical Clarity, then Bitcoin is your religion! I thought that was beautifully said. It points back to us. The strength of Bitcoin as a store of value, as money, is rooted in the faithfulness of its adherents, of its believers, if you will. So it is up to all of us to preserve the principles embodied in those fields of study. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is. We concluded with: Perhaps economics through all of history was just more of a political preference or much more just a social science. Even in Austrian Economics, there\u2019s a very low use of objective measurements because there are no constants in human action, effectively. But it seems like with Bitcoin we do have this collision of computer science and everything underpinning that with the softer social science of economics. So maybe this is the emergence of something really different and unique, like a more objective economic science. These things like Value, Supply & Demand \u2014 supply is the objective side, demand is the subjective side \u2014 these things are still gonna hold the same qualities, but the introduction of absolute scarcity and a money that cannot be monopolized and resists corruption certainly changes the game, right? I don\u2019t know that it will cause us to rewrite the history books per se, but we will move more towards this engineering-like mindset in the field of economics. So yeah! That was it, man! A monster episode. I hope you guys enjoyed that. Episodes 1, 2, 3 built a lot of foundation. I think 4, 5, 6 really started to build some crescendo here, and 7 was a big peak for me personally, especially the later stages of this discussion. I definitely think we\u2019re routing around the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole! I hope you guys enjoyed this and I\u2019ll see you back here soon for the next one!"}

Welcome back to Episode 6 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! So today we\u2019re gonna be talking about how Bitcoin is harder, smarter, faster, and stronger than any form of money in existence! Specifically we\u2019ll be drawing a lot of analogies to gold, which Bitcoin\u2014as we\u2019ve discussed\u2014is disrupting too! And we\u2019re gonna look at this through a number of angles. And a lot of this is building on things we touched on early on in the series like specifically getting into Stone Age technologies and actually how the use of tools and the harnessing of energy is what let\u2019s man be harder, faster, stronger, smarter than any other animal on the planet. So in fact these characteristics define the utility of both innovation and evolution! So the tool that best exhibits them tends to outcompete in the marketplace. So we\u2019re drawing back to some lessons we made earlier. This is Episode 6 and if you haven\u2019t checked out Episodes 1\u20135 yet I suggest that you do, because it all culminates into what we\u2019re getting into now. We\u2019re gonna look at this through a number of angles. One is custody \u2014 how Bitcoin custody is very unique! We\u2019re also gonna get into the specter of quantum computing \u2014 there are a lot of people out there that like to think quantum computing is some kind of big threat to Bitcoin so we\u2019ll dismantle that one. We\u2019re also gonna get into the hardware and software updates of a technology like Bitcoin versus gold and fiat. We\u2019re also gonna look at the programmable aspects of Bitcoin and how that makes it unique! We\u2019re also gonna look at the defensibility of Bitcoin and how it\u2019s one of the most defensible assets \u2014 if not the most defensible assets \u2014 in the history of mankind! And then we\u2019re also gonna look at how \u2014 as monetary energy, Saylor likes to call it \u2014 Bitcoin let\u2019s us place capital more quickly and more intelligently than any other money before in terms of generating yield. So we\u2019ll get into some discussion on that as well. And then finally we\u2019ll get into Bitcoin as being the first truly digital native money \u2014 it is pure information! It\u2019s massless, it can be moved at the speed of light! And this enables a plethora of high frequency and micro transactions that were simply not possible with any other monetary technology historically! Finally we\u2019ll look at how all these elements are combined to give Bitcoin users and HODLers more optionality than any other money in history. And at the end of the day that\u2019s what money is \u2014 it\u2019s the instrument for freedom. So with that, I\u2019m exciting to dive into this one! We\u2019re digging deeper into Bitcoin theory. And yeah \u2014 with that, let\u2019s get into it!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-6-zM573VtcPsF/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 6 | Digital Gold: Harder, Smarter, Stronger, and Faster", "text": "Michael Saylor [06:26]: We talked about Bitcoin as money, but sometimes money has a lot of elements \u2014 as store of value, medium of exchange, unit of measure \u2014 and it an be simplifying and clarifying if we just focus in on Bitcoin as an asset! So Bitcoin is digital gold. And if we use that metaphor some people look at it in a very constrained sense and some people look at it more broadly, but when I say Bitcoin is digital gold, it\u2019s harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than traditional gold! There\u2019s a lot of depth behind it, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s fully appreciated. Let\u2019s just start with harder: We talked a bit about how Bitcoin is harder because of its 21 Million cap, and its stock to flow is exponentially going to infinity. And that\u2019s the easy part of harder because you\u2019re exactly comparing it to gold! And if gold has a stock to flow of 50 and Bitcoin has a stock to flow of infinity then it\u2019s harder! But, there\u2019s another element of harder that we don\u2019t talk about much, and it\u2019s really Nicholas Taleb\u2019s Antifragile harder! Bitcoin is an antifragile element. I\u2019ve used the metaphor cyber hornets but I think people think it\u2019s a cute metaphor but I\u2019m not really thinking it\u2019s a cute metaphor! What I\u2019m meaning is, it\u2019s literally a swarm of cyber hornets that keep getting more powerful that you can\u2019t kill that are going to get harder and stronger and faster and they\u2019re going to eat you if you try to stop them \u2014 and that\u2019s really hard! People don\u2019t think about it like that! But I\u2019ll give you an example, or another metaphor from history: The Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a defense, and it\u2019s a material defense \u2014 it\u2019s like a bunch of stones stacked up and it\u2019s very expensive to create it, and it was meant to keep the Mongols out! And it\u2019s a fragile defense, because it\u2019s literally a static stone structure and it didn\u2019t keep the Mongols out. Eventually they found a weak point in one of the gates, cracked through, and then they slaughtered all the Chinese, defeated the empire \u2014 took over! Now how is that similar to what Alexander the Great\u2019s father said \u2014 Philip II of Macedon \u2014 he\u2019s attributed this quote: No citadel is impenetrable as long as it has a road wide enough for me to fit a donkey up it with a pot of gold on its back!"}

They hacked it! They just ducked it! And if you think about the lessons of military history, one of the lessons is: The best defense is a good offense. And another way to look at it is that if you want a good defense, you need an active defense \u2014 a moving defense! You\u2019re a boxer in a ring and someone wants to hit you \u2014 your best defense is that you move quicker than them and you hit faster and harder than them while they\u2019re getting ready to hit you \u2014 and so they can\u2019t!"}

All forms of life \u2014 they\u2019re living! They\u2019re adaptive! If you kill the weak element, the ones you didn\u2019t kill get stronger! With regard to Bitcoin, it\u2019s composed of a number of elements: there\u2019s software \u2014 the software is running on hardware. The hardware is running in facilities that are plugged into the firmament of some domain. There are people that are running that software, that are operating those facilities, that are building that hardware. And those people are also acting in the political domain and the economic domain, right? There are people in the Bitcoin ecosystem that are improving the Square wallet, they\u2019re improving the Binance exchange. So they\u2019re improving the back end server exchanges, they\u2019re improving the front end client software, they\u2019re improving the hardware wallets, they\u2019re improving the Bitcoin Core software, they\u2019re improving the ASICs that the miners are running, there are people negotiating with governments everywhere on Earth to get better electricity, there are people that are negotiating with politicians to get better regulatory treatment, there are people that are marketing Bitcoin and there are educators \u2014 yourself, on YouTube! There are people on Twitter, there are communicators, there are analysts that are creating analytical functions that are being used to drive and channel the network. They\u2019re all moving! They\u2019re all evolving! They are strong exchanges getting stronger! There are weak exchanges getting weaker, right? We see that all around us! There are countries where Bitcoin mining is flourishing, there are countries where Bitcoin mining is under attack. Gold is a dumb rock \u2014 it is sitting on the floor. Gold is not going to move itself! Gold is not going to feel pain! It\u2019s not gonna feel pity, it\u2019s not gonna feel inspiration \u2014 it\u2019s just going to lie there and wait. And Bitcoin is a different thing! So the antifragility of Bitcoin comes from the fact that everybody in the ecosystem feels the same pain in the same way. If Bitcoin\u2019s price goes down, every Bitcoin HODLer feels it! If Bitcoin is hacked and goes to zero, every Bitcoiner loses their life\u2019s energy! We are a hive creature all integrated with one another\u2014and when there is that pain it spreads very quickly through the entire ecosystem! The information flows rapidly! So if we consider threats to Bitcoin \u2014 a lot of people, they always whine \u2014 I hear this whine, Well what about the quantum computer? What about the quantum computer? And I wanna say, Yeah! And what if an asteroid hits the Earth and kills us all? Or, what about a pocket thermonuclear pencil that blows up the entire universe and what if your enemy gets it before you did? I mean there\u2019s a lot of silly notions of that \u2014 What if somebody had the impossibly powerful weapon and they\u2019re evil and they decide to use it on you? You could look at it that way, but I think a more constructive way to look at it is: If someone comes up with a computer that runs twice as fast as the current computers! The most profitable use of the computer is Bitcoin mining! If someone comes up with something which mines, that generates SHA-256 crypto hashes faster than the current generation of Bitcoin mining equipment, the most lucrative thing you can do with it is plug it into the network and start to contribute more hash rate! And so, who do you think is gonna notice first when that thing happens? If someone comes up with a better \u2014 Well what happens when it gets so powerful that it can break SHA-256? Well, dudes, we\u2019re just gonna go to SHA-512! Or we\u2019re gonna go to the next thing \u2014 1024! And anybody that ever studied computer science knows: We start with 16, go to 32, go to 64, go to 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on and so forth \u2014 and the numbers get pretty fricking big! And then when they get done with that they flip to the next protocol, the next protocol! [16:16] Who do you think is gonna figure that out? The people that have $500 Billion of risk to figure it out? Or someone that\u2019s got no money at all but thinks they might just want to solve the problem just so they can crack the world? And it\u2019s like, Yeah, maybe! But it\u2019s just as likely that some dude\u2019s gonna come up with a revolver that shoots like photon bullets and they\u2019re going to crash the United States government because they\u2019re the first dude with a photon bullet revolver. It\u2019s an interesting idea \u2014 I\u2019m a lot more persuaded if the Pentagon with their hundreds of billions of dollars is gonna come up with a photon bullet gun or the laser rifle or the whatever. So the entire network is channeling innovation. You come up with better hardware? It\u2019s gonna go into the miners. You come up with better client software? It\u2019s gonna go into the wallets. You come up with a better software, or a way to write software? Don\u2019t you think people in the Bitcoin Core community are gonna use that way to write better software? And if it\u2019s too dangerous, the community is gonna slow it down \u2014 otherwise, if there\u2019s a political threat, everybody that\u2019s adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset has a vested interest in dealing with the political threat. And if they can\u2019t deal with it \u2014 if you are a creature with two arms and I wrap a tourniquet around one of your arms and I choke off the blood flow, the arm dies \u2014 use the other arm! When you\u2019re an octopus, you\u2019ve got eight. When you\u2019re a hydra, you\u2019ve got a million. So the entire creature\u2019s just going to move to a place where there is oxygen where it can live. And if it can fight, it will fight. And if it can\u2019t fight, it will morph itself into a different domain, and unless you figure out a way to kill it everywhere at the same time \u2014 utterly, down to the last node \u2014 you\u2019re probably not gonna kill it. And it seems to me that nobody\u2019s really got a vested interest in doing that and if they did it\u2019s just not clear. Pick one government \u2014 one government attacks it, it becomes more useful to every other government. And they all can\u2019t agree on anything, ever. And even if they could agree on anything, ever, they still can\u2019t do it, right?"}

I love the quote from Philip II of Macedon about the road being wide enough for a donkey with a pot of gold. That relates to me to the famous quote from Charlie Munger: Show me the incentive and I\u2019ll show you the outcome. And I think that is one of the key aspects of Bitcoin is that, even if you have this breakthrough \u2014 quantum computer, whatever it is \u2014 you\u2019re still incentivized to contribute that innovation to the network. That is the most lucrative, most energy-efficient strategy possible, even in that breakthrough environment. And to your point about cryptography \u2014 it\u2019s always been a cat and mouse game. It\u2019s always been kind of the defense, someone trying to crack it, and then the defense adapts. To your point it\u2019s a dynamic defense, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s ongoing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so relevant.

So gatekeeper is a very powerful metaphor: The reason that the Great Wall of China fell was because there were gates and there were gatekeepers. And the prosperity of 100 Million people could be destroyed by corrupting the one on the gate. As soon as the one gatekeeper opens the gate, the 100,000 person army comes through. And herein you see the problem with hiding behind a wall, or hiding behind a wall with a gate in it. A much better idea would be: I have my own 100,000 person army and when that army comes I stand against them. And that\u2019s what the Romans knew. The Romans never sat and cowered behind a gate, they knew \u2014 and anybody in a war knows \u2014 you have to go and leave the citadel and you have to actively fight the army that would kill you, because if they manage to surround you and isolate you, no amount of defense is going to hold [them] back. They will find a way through, and that\u2019s the story of history. Gatekeepers are your weakness! There\u2019s no gatekeepers in Bitcoin, and there\u2019s no gatekeepers in a decentralized proof of work network that\u2019s energy-intensive. That\u2019s one of the problems I think of like proof of stake networks or the \u2014 every time someone tries to come up with a \u201cmore efficient way to do it\u201d, well if you\u2019re going to secure a $1 Trillion network with $1 Billion of stuff staked, the problem with that is all I need is another $1 Billion to bribe that person. Or half a billion! Half a billion bribes half that network and then I topple the entire trillion and I get it all, right? So when you have anything where I\u2019m playing games where I\u2019m trying to use a small amount of energy \u2014 and money is energy, right? \u2014 a small amount of money, a small amount of energy. If you\u2019re trying to use a small amount of energy to secure a large amount of energy, you created a gatekeeper! And so you need to flip the pyramid, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s no shortcuts here: There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. And it doesn\u2019t terribly bother me that Bitcoin channels a lot of energy. By the way \u2014 through encryption facilities! A miner is an encryption facility, it\u2019s generating SHA-256 hashes and you\u2019re gonna have to get through that hash wall, and the only way you\u2019re gonna get through it is you\u2019re gonna have to buy yourself 51% of all of that equipment on Earth, and then you\u2019re gonna have to harness 51% of all the energy, and then you\u2019re gonna have to attack and it still may not work!"}

When the thing\u2019s worth $10 Trillion and the transaction fees are 1%, there\u2019s gonna be $100 Billion worth a year worth of transaction fees, so it\u2019s $51 Billion a year. If you cap that at 20x, it\u2019s $1 Trillion just to go along with the program! So someone\u2019s gonna have to have $100 Trillion and be really mad in order to want to spend $1 Trillion to destroy other people \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, you\u2019re not gonna get to attack the thing without a counterattack, right? Because at the point that you have 100 Million people that all have all of their life\u2019s energy \u2014 all of their hopes, their aspirations and all of their economic security and physical security invested in the network \u2014 they\u2019re probably not gonna roll over and let you do it. It\u2019s pretty hard for one evil genius by themself to plot a trillion-dollar war on a cyber network. How are you gonna gather the software and the hardware and the monetary energy and the political support by yourself? And if you\u2019re not by yourself, I\u2019m reminded of the phrase, Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. [24:56] So when I think about Bitcoin I think, It\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s harder because it\u2019s an evolving herd creature, an evolving swarm creature. And it\u2019s evolving as fast as it can, and it feels pain. As Nicholas Taleb says in Antifragile, Pain is a good thing! You can tell the difference between people that get it and people that don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s a group of people in life that run from pain, and they\u2019re attempting to anesthesize themselves and always isolate themselves from pain. And there\u2019s a group of people that run toward pain, or at least they embrace pain. Pain\u2019s a good thing! The more pain you feel, the faster your reflexes. Put your hand on a hot stove, it moves quickly \u2014 you have reflexes. So that system is learning and pain is one of our number one information signals \u2014 maybe the most important information signal, in order to provide a living organism with vitality."}

Yeah Taleb says that, Stressors and pain are indistinguishable from information at the organic level. That it\u2019s the only way that an organic system learns is by exposure to something that is resistive or conflictive to it. And even at a genetic level, when a virus invades a host organism and destroys its cells, there\u2019s always a few cells that survive. And those cells that survive actually take some of the DNA from the virus that wiped out 99% of their cellular comrades and incorporates that DNA into its own such that it is resistant now to that virus. So it\u2019s happening at an informational level even deep in biology. This isn\u2019t just something that happens kind of at the physical layer here. It happens really \u2014 it\u2019s quintessential to life, is I guess the point I\u2019m getting at."}

And I think that if it\u2019s not a living thing, it can\u2019t be hard, it can\u2019t be hardest! People think gold is the hardest thing because it\u2019s a rock, but it really isn\u2019t the hardest thing. The hardest thing is like the Mongolian horde if you\u2019re in its way. When the horde with 100,000 comes at you and they\u2019re terrorizing, blood-curdling with their missiles \u2014 and if you read the history of Genghis Khan, they would ride across the plain, they\u2019d find a city, the city is surrounded by a moat, they would go upriver and divert the river, they would divert the river, choke the city, starve them of water for three days, and they\u2019d ride underneath the gates in the riverbed. It\u2019s just horrifying, blood-curdling, living horde creature. And you want to attack it? It\u2019s moving. You could go to it, retreat, they stop, they turn around, they throw you off balance, they murder you. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re dealing with living creatures. Go into a hornets nest, attack the hornets with your revolver \u2014 see what happens. The most horrifying thing, right?

And it seems to me that\u2019s what you\u2019re facing when you face Bitcoin. You\u2019re facing this swarm intelligence of individually self-interested but collectively organized life force that\u2019s defending their own life energy. So it seems just really hard to attack that. Almost as if you\u2019re attacking the honey in the wasp nest \u2014 they\u2019re gonna come at you with everything they\u2019ve got."}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-6-zM573VtcPsF/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 6 | Digital Gold: Harder, Smarter, Stronger, and Faster", "text": "Michael Saylor [30:17]: Yeah gatekeepers are like centralized banks or centralized regulators. Those are gatekeepers and political financial systems and gatekeepers on the wall of China on a wall are literally gatekeepers. And the result is: one person has the power to destroy the lives of a million by opening the gate. Because Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a gate there\u2019s no gatekeeper, therefore there\u2019s no asymmetric payoff. It\u2019s not economically feasible to break through. Now another big advantage in the antifragility of Bitcoin is this idea that I can run my own node, I can take my own keys off the network, I can choose to trust them with a custodian, or I can choose to take ownership of them myself, and I can choose for example to put a million dollars with a custodian that\u2019s going to run a bank or maybe lend it out or give me yield on it or protect it. But then at the point that I lose confidence in them, I can shift all those assets to another trustee, or I can take physical possession of them myself, and because you have lots of different entities \u2014 individuals and corporations \u2014 choosing to do different things at all times, even though someone might entrust their keys to a bank, the security of the entire system is being protected by the someone that doesn\u2019t! So the diversity with which people choose to engage and support the network actually makes it more antifragile. And the potential\u2014for example: if I know that you are gonna take possession of your keys, and then if you set up an organization that\u2019s custodians that will hold my keys and charge me 10 basis points, then if another organization charges me 50 basis points, I would just say to them, I\u2019m gonna shift to the 10 basis points. The competition drives their rate down or I move to 10 basis points. If I hear that your exchange or your custodian is not secure or it might not be secure, or if I heard that there\u2019s a new multisig protocol that more secure and I ask you and you don\u2019t support, I move my keys or I move my assets to the next wallet, the next technique. That means that you cannot afford to ignore me because you don\u2019t have a monopoly, right? There\u2019s no regulator saying I have to leave my keys with the Breedlove Trust in order to get a tax deduction, or in order to qualify for a 501c3, 413, 509, etc. IRA, this or that. As you start to have pure competition, you get this ferocious evolution in all aspects of the ecosystem. And we saw it with miners for example: they started with CPUs, and they flipped to GPUs, and then they went to ASICs. And like every 3 years there\u2019s another generation. The thing that really destroys the quantum computing argument is, if anything, Bitcoin has proven that people that believe in the Bitcoin network are going to pursue the highest performance special-purpose client and server hardware before everybody else in the world! If you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin wallets, they\u2019re more secure than any other mobile client device. And if you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin ASIC miners, they\u2019re higher performance than AWS or any device you\u2019ll find on a public cloud. And that\u2019s because Bitcoiners have skin in the game. Back to one of Nicholas Taleb\u2019s books, it\u2019s like everybody that writes the software, runs the software, uses the software \u2014 everybody has skin in the game. If you go to business it\u2019s gonna be obliterated if you fall behind. As a miner you can\u2019t make any money. As a wallet you can\u2019t sell anything. As a crypto bank exchange \u2014 look how fast the money moves out of one exchange to another this week. Everybody has skin in the game, nobody can ignore the pain, agency bias is very hard to come by, and you can expect every year forever, it\u2019s gonna get harder! Now back to this issue of Apple and Amazon: Apple\u2019s the most valuable company on Earth because they can ship a software update to a billion people for a nickel. That\u2019s pretty powerful! Well with Bitcoin, you can rewrite the software that runs the nodes to make it smarter, right? You can rewrite the software or the firmware that works on the mining devices. And so the hardware cycle \u2014 what\u2019s the upgrade cycle on hardware\u20142 years maybe? 1, 2, 3 years? In that range. What\u2019s the upgrade cycle on software? Well it depends on whether it\u2019s the node or the client software \u2014 1, 2, 3, years. In the greater scheme of things, it doesn\u2019t have to be super fast, you just have to compare it to the number of hardware and software upgrade cycles on gold."}

In 5 Billion years! Gold\u2019s pretty much 5 Billion years \u2014 God made it, and left it that way. And there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from that, but the point is: it\u2019s not upgrading, it\u2019s not going to move. And if it doesn\u2019t move, invariably when human beings come in conflict with mountains, we move the mountains! We move the rivers, we chop up the granite. Go look at a citadel, it\u2019s literally moved the mountain. You might have to move it 2 tons at a time. Look at the pyramids. 5,000 years ago someone figured out how to move a mountain of rock. And that\u2019s 5,000\u20144,000 years ago! Are you gonna bet against 100,000 humans with their channeling gravity, channeling water, channeling whatever? Or are you gonna bet on the mountain? And the answer is: you\u2019re gonna bet on the human beings! When you roll forward and you look at human beings versus animals, it\u2019s the same thing: us versus elephants, us versus lions, us versus nature \u2014 anything living. Generally we figure out how to beat it because we channel energy better! So now we\u2019re talking about, What are we competing with here? Well, if we\u2019re competing with gold it just seems like no contest whatsoever! Let\u2019s talk about smarter, stronger, and faster. Because harder is relevant to money, but smarter, stronger, and faster is the source of all tech value in the past 20 years \u2014 maybe in the past 2,000 years. Let\u2019s talk about smarter. Well if Bitcoin is programmable money \u2014 it\u2019s a pure energy token and I can move it around \u2014 that means that I can write software on the clients and I can software on the server that will actually move the money. And that means you can hold keys to 100 Bitcoin and then you can write software that will prove that you\u2019re credit-worthy, that you own the keys to 100 Bitcoin. Then you can actually use it to register and certify a transaction or information or a title channeled into that. I can write a piece of software that will \u2014 what do I want? What if a million people wanted to borrow money pledging Bitcoin? And what if another million people wanted to loan out money and generate interest? And what if I write a program where everybody on one side says, I\u2019ll pay 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8% interest, and everybody on the other side says, I\u2019ll make a loan assuming a collateral coverage of 4:1 in Bitcoin and I can mark it to market every hour. Okay? You\u2019re offering me terms, you\u2019re offering the loan, I\u2019m offering to borrow, we create a piece of software, it runs every day, every minute, every second. Robert, what if you had 10 Bitcoin and I scanned everybody \u2014 100 Million people \u2014 what if I scanned them today and I found someone willing to pay you 8% interest with a loan to value of 10% and you could mark it to market every minute? Good deal? Maybe! Maybe a good deal! Maybe you wouldn\u2019t be willing to loan it, but if you did \u2014 what if I went through all 100 Million of \u2019em and I found someone that needed the money real bad and would pay you 27% interest? Smart. Smart? What if I actually ran the algorithm every hour? What if I ran the algorithm every second? What if someone wants to borrow the money for a year and they\u2019ll pay you 10%? And what if they want to borrow for 30 years and they\u2019ll pay you 15%? What if they want to borrow for 1 year and they\u2019ll pay you 5%? What if they want to pay you overnight and they\u2019ll pay you x%? You could generate the yield curve with a piece of software, and then that software will connect all of the lenders with all of the borrowers on a server. It could be a centralized server. The logic doesn\u2019t have to be decentralized. In fact a centralized server runs a billion times faster than a proof of work network, so it\u2019s likely that the logic will be smart, and that\u2019s an idea. Another idea is: put the intelligence on your iPhone and be able to talk to your iPhone and when I talk to my iPhone I can tell it to chop my money into 37 pieces and send it off \u2014 Send my money to my daughter and let her spend it on ice cream but not on Uber rides because I don\u2019t want her running off with her boyfriend somewhere. So I can condition the money using all manner of software, and I can turn on servers that will move my money around while I\u2019m sleeping, and I can turn on clients that will handle my money. And of course, if I walked into your bedroom and I picked up a gold bar and I walked out with it, the bar\u2019s not gonna complain \u2014 it\u2019s a dumb rock! On the other hand, if I took your Bitcoin and I wrapped your multi-factor authentication around it and your retina scan and your voice scan, I could geofence it and I could say, Nobody can move a mobile device with this Bitcoin key outside 100 meters of where Robert lives. You could do all sorts of magical crazy things with software that you can\u2019t do in mechanics \u2014 machines. So gold is in essence mechanical, and Bitcoin is virtual. And of course, it\u2019s tokenized, and that means it can get as smart as the computer can get smart, and eventually the computers can talk to other computers and that opens up all sorts of applications like credit ratings, authenticity, insurance. Maybe I want to buy insurance for you but I want you to pledge the full value of my house and I want to know that you have the proof of the reserves to pay off the insurance, right? So you can create very interesting pieces of software with less risk or more transparency and more speed. We know it doesn\u2019t work with gold. It doesn\u2019t work with tokenized gold, because you\u2019ve got the counterparty risk and you don\u2019t know whether the tokens actually are backed by real gold. It doesn\u2019t really work with other tokenized assets because stocks, bonds\u2014they move too slow \u2014 and there\u2019s no API between the bonds and the tokens and if there was an API you end up with regulatory compliance issues and you\u2019re not delivering the physical instrument, ever. So that\u2019s just not likely to happen."}

It\u2019s not adapting, it\u2019s not changing. I wonder if \u2014 so today, to kind of change the lanes a little bit, the US Treasury is considered the risk-free rate in the world, being that it bears low to no interest, but it [presumably] has no risk of default, or the lowest risk of default. As you see us moving into more of a Bitcoin-denominated world, there have been talks of a risk-free rate for Bitcoin developing on the Lightning Network, such that you would fund these Lightning channels in time-locked contracts that the market would determine \u2014 anywhere from a minute to 30 years \u2014 and it would bear some interest rate. Do you think that\u2019s the direction the risk-free rate goes? Is that how we develop a Bitcoin yield curve? Or how do you see that evolving?"}

I think on a chain like Lightning above the base chain \u2014 by the way you could do it with a centralized or a decentralized solution, right? So Lightning is one solution, but you could do it on any exchange too if they chose to do it. There\u2019s a lot of ways to solve the problem. The key idea is to create a free market yield curve. Rational people of their own volition would never willingly loan you for 30 years for 1.4% interest. There is no person that would think that\u2019s a good idea to do it. In a free market you would expect that you would see \u2014 30-year rates would definitely be north of 10-year rates and north of 1-year rates \u2014 you would see things like 3, 4% short term, 5, 6% 10-year, 8% long term risk-free rates. And that\u2019s what they used to be! When Volcker finished his work and he kind of like reset everything, for a while \u2014 the conventional wisdom back in the 80\u2019s was the long term risk-free rate was about 7\u20138% and then the risk premium was 4% and so the cost of capital was about 12% on making an investment. And that\u2019s how they came at it. And the interest rates typically mirrored that \u2014 you could get a savings account for 4\u20135% \u2014 anywhere from 4\u20138% on the yield curve. It\u2019s only state intervention that will deflect it below that. We could talk about that when we get to interest, but that\u2019s my thinking on that. With regard to Bitcoin as an asset, we talked about why it\u2019s harder and why it\u2019s smarter \u2014 because you can program it \u2014 but it\u2019s also stronger. And the stronger is an important thing. Strong is about channeling energy with force and acceleration. I walk into the ring\u2014we\u2019re gonna fight. If I punch slowly, I could be strong. But if I\u2019m slow I don\u2019t win! The fighters that win have explosive force. You could be stronger than me but I can strike you before you strike me I can knock you out. And so it\u2019s all about how explosively you can channel that energy. And that\u2019s what an arrow is, or a sling, or a bullet. It\u2019s not the guy that\u2019s the biggest, strongest, fastest, that wins \u2014 it\u2019s the guy that puts a bullet in your head first that wins. And so we know that in military combat. If we think about stronger in the context of money, it\u2019s all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration. So that means on a Saturday afternoon from a standing start, if you have $10 Million, can you figure out where to put the $10 Million to generate the most yield? Like, I need software! If I had $10 Million in gold, I can\u2019t do anything with it on a Saturday afternoon. On the other hand, if I have $10 Million of Bitcoin and I wrap it with a server, and if the server scans through 1,000 institutional counterparties and then I finance the bid, then I could chop my $10 Million of Bitcoin into 10 pieces. I could send $1 Million to Tokyo, $1 Million to Beijing, Berlin, London. I could leave some of it outstanding for a 1-week loan, some for a 1-month loan, some for a 1-year loan. If their circumstances change \u2014 if you\u2019re pledging some other kind of collateral and I\u2019m marking it to market and it changes, I could snatch back my assets. And so the ability to channel the energy and move it where I need to move it intelligently, fast \u2014 what if I make you a loan of $1 Million at 12% interest on Saturday, and then you come back to me 4 minutes later and you want another million and you\u2019ll pay me 12% more? And what if I like your credit? In the virtual world, in the Bitcoin world, I can just send another million! What if you come back and say, Okay I\u2019ll take $10 Million and give you 14% \u2014 I just need it for 3 days? 3 hours? That\u2019s [fast], right? You can\u2019t do that with gold, ever! And if I had a bond or Apple stock or something like that on a Saturday, it\u2019s not moving! But realistically\u2014I\u2019m giving you an extreme example because it\u2019s kind of magical that your computer server is making you money by scanning the networks on a Saturday afternoon\u2014well I don\u2019t have to be that extreme. For example, if you have $100 Million of Apple stock sitting with the wire house, a big bank \u2014 pick up the phone and tell them you found someone that\u2019s willing to give you 3% interest on the Apple stock \u2014 they would laugh at you! Ha ha ha, ha ha ha!\u2014Well we don\u2019t give interest on that! Well could you just like loan it out to this other party that\u2019s willing to give me \u2014 ha ha ha, no. When\u2019s the last time you got interest on your stock assets from the bank or the trustee that\u2019s holding the stock? Never! They don\u2019t do it! Okay so let\u2019s go through the thought experiment: You have $100 Million in cash, you put it in a savings account back in 1988 that gives you 5% interest. You have $100 Million and you put it into Apple stock and they give you a dividend. Okay good. Now the bank loans your Apple stock to someone that\u2019s gonna short the Apple stock, they short it, they sell it for $100 Million, they take their cash, they put it into something yielding 5% interest, they keep the 5% \u2014 what you get? Nothing! Your Apple stock got hypothecated, you didn\u2019t get paid, and yet if you had $100 Million in a market basket of stocks, why shouldn\u2019t you get a yield on it? The reason you don\u2019t get a yield on it is because conventional financial industry doesn\u2019t have an incentive to do it nor a need to do it, they just [have the power? 52:03] and you don\u2019t! And what causes people to do that is competition. Sometimes by the way [the reason you don\u2019t see] competition across regulatory domain is because if I can get all the regulators in my country to agree that we won\u2019t do this then it\u2019s collusion and regulatory capture. And so when you have a cross-domain asset, it\u2019s less likely you\u2019d have regulatory capture. Ultimately, the strength of Bitcoin comes from the fact that an individual can self-custody and so if the individual can custody and they can do it in any of 200 different regulatory jurisdictions, they can find a jurisdiction where they will have the strongest money where they can generate the most yield and they can move to that jurisdiction. Whereas you\u2019re not gonna be able to convince that mega [inaudible 52:58] bank to move to that jurisdiction and give you the most favorable terms, because they have no interest in that. So that\u2019s what stronger is all about. And then faster comes back to the idea that we\u2019ve dematerialized the gold, and because we\u2019ve dematerialized the gold there\u2019s no mass. And if E=MC\u00b2 and the M goes to zero, then we get the C\u00b2 with very little E! Well at least get the C. We can actually get to the speed of light because we have no mass, and when we think about $100 Million of gold, back to my 3,000 lb metaphor, that\u2019s $250,000 every time you go around the Earth \u2014 so what if I want to send it around the Earth every week? Every day? Every hour?"}

And so faster means that I can send it at the speed of light, and if I can send it at the speed of light, then there\u2019s all sorts of high-frequency transactions and microtransactions that make sense now that never made sense before. How about a world where one rich person makes loans to 10,000 middle class people every week? That\u2019s inconceivable with gold. That\u2019s not possible with stocks or bonds. Because sometimes it\u2019s regulatory compliance issues, or it might be systems issues, right? But it is possible to imagine with Bitcoin \u2014 someone will just create the eBay of social finance. What about one rich person that wants to lend money to 10 institutions? What about 10 institutions that want to work with each other? Ultimately, the things that make something slow, it might be physical mass like the weight of gold that makes it slow, it might be impedance, and the impedance might be a systems impedance. Like it\u2019s Friday afternoon and I cannot move money between 4pm on Friday and 9:30am on Monday. That\u2019s a systems impedance \u2014 it\u2019s not a law, it\u2019s just a custom. And if it\u2019s on Thanksgiving or Christmas well then that doesn\u2019t count either. And then there\u2019s compliance: there is a law. There might be a regulation in a city, a state, or a country, that keeps the energy from moving. There might be a system that keeps the energy from moving. Or there just might be laws of conservation of mass that keeps the energy from moving. And so by moving out of that domain into the cyber domain, you get speed, which is somewhere in the order of 1,000 to 1 Billion times faster! You put all those together: something that\u2019s just continually getting \u2014 and by the way, it\u2019s getting smarter every year, right? We\u2019ve all seen on Google the computers beat humans on chess playing. The computers are all beating us all on everything. The algorithms just keep getting smarter. Wouldn\u2019t you like an algorithm that figured out how to make you money while you\u2019re sleeping? Because I would! Programmed trading, right? The manifestation is programmed trading right now! And the issue is: consumers don\u2019t have the power of programmed trading algorithms to protect their financial interest when their financial, their monetary energy is denominated in traditional assets because they can\u2019t plug their assets into that new system."}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-6-zM573VtcPsF/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 6 | Digital Gold: Harder, Smarter, Stronger, and Faster", "text": "Robert Breedlove [57:13]: Alright guys! So that was Episode 6 of Michael Saylor here in the Saylor Series. And wow. What can I say? We\u2019re just addressing Bitcoin from every side and putting it in the context of technological development on the whole \u2014 as an essential\u2014as all technologies develop, essentially we\u2019re really putting Bitcoin in that context. Again if you haven\u2019t seen the earlier episodes please go check them out because a lot of this hearkens back to that and I mean I hope you\u2019re enjoying it, I just think it\u2019s getting so good. So as Saylor goes into, Bitcoin is a better tool because it\u2019s harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than gold. And gold historically is the best monetary technology the world has ever had. And we go into this a number of ways. The one very obvious instance that\u2019s most often discussed in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is the hardest money that has ever been. Meaning that it has the highest stock to flow ratio, or said differently the lowest inflation rate \u2014 that one\u2019s obvious. We\u2019ve touched on that one a lot. But another way to look at it is that Bitcoin is also the hardest money that\u2019s ever existed because it\u2019s the most adaptive to entropy. It\u2019s the most antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had, if not the only antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had. And Saylor gives a great example when he talks about a fragile versus an antifragile defense with the Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a static defense, it had a single point of failure, and despite all the effort that went into building and securing that perimeter, the Mongols were able compromise one of the gates, and that\u2019s all it took! The rest of the wall didn\u2019t matter so long as you could compromise a single point. And I think this is very interesting because it\u2019s pointing to the fact that gatekeepers and gates are weaknesses. They are single points of failure in a standard, static defense like that. And I really liked the quote \u2014 I forgot who said it, Philip II of Macedonia perhaps \u2014 but he said that, No citadel is impenetrable if I can fit a donkey with a pot of gold up a road leading to it. Meaning that the defense itself doesn\u2019t necessarily matter if there is a gate or a gatekeeper because you can bribe the gatekeeper! And this is another way that Bitcoin\u2019s outcompeting the legacy system because the legacy system is built on gatekeepers! That\u2019s what central banks are, that\u2019s what governments are \u2014 they\u2019re all just gatekeepers for these flows of economic vitality or monetary energy. And they\u2019re all siphoning it in a tax or a transaction fee with every movement. But Bitcoin as we know doesn\u2019t have any gatekeepers, and in fact Bitcoiners are actively engaging with gatekeepers in the legacy system every day to negotiate better deals with regulators, energy producers, users, businesses in the space, etc. So I think this is a really important point, that gatekeepers are a weakness, and Bitcoin suffers no gatekeepers! That is a breakthrough that it is the first fully disintermediated money. We can just transact peer-to-peer. So that may sound kind of like a nerdy abstraction but it\u2019s really fundamentally important in terms of defending the monetary energy. The other point too going to the antifragility aspect is that the best defense is an adaptive defense, one that responds to the nature of the threat and the character of the aggressor in ways that adapt and respond to changes of circumstances. And I think this is very interesting with Bitcoin because the more the market cap grows, the more monetary energy is stored on its network, the more incentivized all network participants are to defend it, to defend the 21 Million hard cap for instance, or to defend fungibility or privacy at higher layers and to figure things out on behalf of Bitcoin. Everyone\u2019s fate in Bitcoin is intertwined and everyone\u2019s pointed in the same direction. And I think this is heavily discounted in the price in my opinion! Bitcoiners are by nature very adversarial thinkers, but what we don\u2019t often consider in the network design is\u2014we look at worst-case scenarios all the time \u2014 but we fail to account for how highly motivated Bitcoiners actually are to defend the network and to defend the ecosystem. And I would argue even in the market price of Bitcoin this is highly discounted. Bitcoin on balance is relatively highly discounted because it\u2019s just so misunderstood. But I would say even those that understand Bitcoin fail to account for this properly. Again, all of these highly motivated network participants all engaging with other market participants in the broader market, making better deals, and feeding capital into Bitcoin \u2014 in that way everyone ends up on Bitcoin\u2019s payroll in a way \u2014 once you become a HODLer you have these huge incentives to defend the network, to evangelize, to educate, to build businesses in this space. So it\u2019s just a radical vortex of incentives that bootstraps and protects itself. And that\u2019s why so many people call Bitcoin a living thing. And to Saylor\u2019s point, to be truly hard and antifragile, the system needs to be alive. It needs to be adaptive, it needs to respond spontaneously to changes in the environment. And for an antifragile organism, by definition, when you kill any part of the antifragile organism \u2014 even if you kill 99% of it \u2014 and you don\u2019t destroy all of it, then whatever pain inflicted on that animal, it\u2019s going to generate a response to that and it\u2019s going to come back stronger. So that\u2019s what antifragility is, it\u2019s the ability to become hardened through hostility. We see this in most organisms but Brandon Quittem has written about this a lot comparing Mycelium to Bitcoin in that it\u2019s this decentralized network archetype. It\u2019s learning at the edges by having conflicts with different adversarial characters and yet incorporating those learnings into the whole of the organism. And Bitcoin is very similar. So in the sphere of money Bitcoin is the first and only antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had. And if you haven\u2019t read Taleb\u2019s book by that title, Antifragile, one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve read it twice. It\u2019s really hard to stop something that\u2019s antifragile. Antifragile things or organisms or organizations or tools, they dominate the world. They live in a universe pervaded by entropy. Uncertainty is always unfolding in real time. The things that can adapt best to that uncertainty and learn from it the most quickly become dominant. That\u2019s just a principle of the universe. So that\u2019s a lot to chew on and a lot to get your head around, but when you come to see Bitcoin in that light I think it makes a compelling case for it. And again it\u2019s Bitcoin \u2014 this antifragile beast \u2014 going up against gold, something that doesn\u2019t feel pain, inspiration, motivation. It\u2019s an inorganic commodity. And also going up against fiat currency, which is probably the most fragile institution in history. The one certainty that we know about fiat currency is that it collapses time and time again. Then we got into another aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s hardness, and that is \u2014 it has this diversity of custodianship and custody schemas that we\u2019ve never before seen in any other asset. And again this is because Bitcoin is just pure information. The switching costs for custodianship are very low, and that threat of self-custody \u2014 to Saylor\u2019s point \u2014 it always forces custodians to behave honestly. And to deliver custodial services that are very high quality at a very low price. So it\u2019s very frictionless to move your capital from one custodian to another \u2014 it\u2019s what keeps everyone honest and competitive. It imposes this free-market paradigm. The way I\u2019ve described that before too is the five properties of money. Bitcoin is optimized for perfected portability because it\u2019s pure information. So it\u2019s just information, it can move at the speed of light. And because it\u2019s just information that can move at the speed of light and it\u2019s massless, you can code it into so many different hard to find custody schemes. There\u2019s people that have put their private keys into a song or written it into a public article that only they know how to decode. So it\u2019s just radically new and interesting in terms of how you can safeguard this asset. And then we got into a bit of this specter of quantum computer, it\u2019s one of the most popular ways to discredit Bitcoin. Everyone says, Oh when quantum computing breaks through, Bitcoin\u2019s over with! First of all it\u2019s totally ignorant of the fact that if quantum computing did actually occur it would break all of the commercial Internet as we know it: everything that\u2019s protected under cryptography would be rendered useless essentially. So there are massive incentives even outside of Bitcoin to develop quantum resistant encryption in response to a quantum computing breakthrough. But the other point Saylor makes is that Bitcoiners live at the vanguard of this space and they have, again, north of $300 Billion of market cap to protect, and they are interacting with these client server hardware implementations on a daily basis, especially on the mining network. So they\u2019re gonna be the first to see or smell or detect this type of breakthrough coming through and they\u2019ll be the first to adapt! So we left off talking about Bitcoin\u2019s hardware and software update cycles and how they compare to other forms of money. With Bitcoin the hardware refresh cycle for mining hardware specifically tends to be around 1\u20133 years. It\u2019s sometimes a little more extended the closer we\u2019re getting to the 4-year halving cycle. But as more producers enter the space \u2014 producing ASICs \u2014 that cycle is subject to change. But the point is that the hardware protecting the Bitcoin network is always being refreshed. Whether it\u2019s 1 or 4 years. And then the software cycles for Bitcoin vary as well depending on whether it\u2019s node or mining software. That tends to take place within the scope of a year. Regardless, when you compare this to gold, gold is a dumb shiny rock. It undergoes zero hardware or software updates in its 5,000-year use as money. Bitcoin is just so much faster in that respect. Again it\u2019s constantly adapting to new circumstances at a rate to which gold could never hope to do because gold does not have hardware or software \u2014 it does not adapt at all. And that hearkens back to the example Saylor gave: Which one are you gonna choose to bet on? Are you gonna choose the mountain? The static mountain? Or are you gonna bet on the humans that encounter that mountain? Humans that can adapt, develop new tools and ways and innovations of moving the mountain and destroying the mountain. We\u2019re back to this static defense versus an active offense. If the defense is unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of the aggressor then it\u2019s always going to lose! When humans encounter that mountain with this swarm intelligence of ingenuity, we\u2019re figuring out how to drill holes into the rock, plant dynamite in there, blow it up, clear it out, build a road through it. So we\u2019re pointing to where it\u2019s better to place your chips. Whether it\u2019s on the static defense of something like gold or the dynamic defense of something like Bitcoin. Then we got into how money, specifically Bitcoin versus gold and fiat \u2014 it\u2019s much stronger, smarter, and faster. And these aspects, as we\u2019ve touched on early in this series, they\u2019re actually the source of all innovational and evolutional value. Again, the reason mankind dominates the world is because he\u2019s able to coordinate his efforts with others and harness energy and tools in a way that makes him smarter, faster, stronger, than all other creatures in the world. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with innovation! We\u2019re not physically becoming faster, stronger, smarter necessarily, although we do become smarter, clearly. But our collective efforts are becoming smarter, stronger, faster, is the point there. This reminds me of that quote Saylor brought up early in the series that as far as he can tell, Mankind is the only animal that plays with fire. So we figured out\u2014we\u2019re able to self-reflect on the nature of the natural universe and figured out how to harness its gifts and allocate them towards our ends. And that makes us very very unique. This gets into Mises. Mises is one of the fathers of Austrian Economics. He wrote a great book called Human Action. And in Human Action he describes the science of praxeology, which is actually the study of purpose-driven behavior. And it\u2019s: man always takes action with means towards ends. So everything is a means or an ends to man! But things themselves are not means. This table is just a materialist item in the universe, but it becomes means when I allocate my purpose into resting my computer on this table. So we have this very special gift of projecting our intellect into the universe and then actually channeling energy through it. That makes us just radically different than all the other animals. So to get back to money, in terms of how Bitcoin is smarter: first of all it\u2019s programmable. You can imagine\u2014the example he gave was being able to write some automated software that actually created a marketplace for Bitcoin lending and borrowing. And this is a super interesting aspect because it actually has the possibility of facilitating a yield curve for Bitcoin. Yield curve simply means typically a market-based time series that shows you the rate of return you can get on capital by lending it out. Anywhere from 1\u201330 years in the case of US treasuries. That is the last element Bitcoin lacks to become a truly preferable global store of value. That\u2019s the one thing that US treasuries and other government bonds currently have over Bitcoin is that they have a built-in yield. I\u2019ve had some talks with people in Lightning Labs about this. I actually think that could be the route this goes. And if we can develop these time-locked Lightning smart contracts where people are actually putting Bitcoin into a time-locked channel to facilitate Lightning Network liquidity, and then the markets matching that demand for Bitcoin borrow with an interest rate yield \u2014 maybe they\u2019re getting a piece of the transaction fees for the routing fees through Lightning Network. That time series set of smart contracts could become the Bitcoin yield curve that actually leads Bitcoin to becoming this long contemplated pristine collateral, which US treasuries serve the purpose of today. In fact this actually points to another way to think about hard money. If you\u2019re holding gold on a gold standard or you\u2019re holding Bitcoin on a Bitcoin standard, that money tends to appreciate roughly approximate to the aggregate productivity growth of the world, because again it\u2019s holding its scarcity, so as goods and services become relatively more abundant, that money\u2014holding demand constant \u2014 would fetch more goods and services. So if the global GDP is growing at 3% per year, we would expect that on a hard money standard, the hard money itself would grow at about 3% per year. So this is really interesting because that makes hard money on a hard money standard similar to a non-counterparty investment in an index fund invested in global equities. It\u2019s like whatever business is doing whatever in the world to create more goods and services, this hard money that I\u2019m holding with no counterparty risk \u2014 it\u2019s a bearer asset so I\u2019m holding it, I\u2019m custodying it, I\u2019m not subject to default risk with anyone else \u2014 it actually acts as a passive index investment in all of those global equities creating more goods and services! That\u2019s just another way to think about it that I thought was really interesting. Another way that Bitcoin\u2019s smarter is that it\u2019s more defensible. With gold you could put it into a vault, you could secure it with armed guard, put it in a fortress \u2014 whatever. But Bitcoin\u2019s unique in that it can be wrapped in technology layers of security. So you can wrap it in 2FA, Face ID, biometrics, geofencing \u2014 all of these unique software-enabled security schemes are only possible with something like Bitcoin. With gold it\u2019s just not possible because gold will always suffer from the oracle problem. You\u2019ll always need to ultimately trust the custodian of the gold at the end of that chain of security features. Whereas Bitcoin can actually be directly integrated with the software security features. So then looking at Bitcoin as stronger money: to clarify we don\u2019t mean strong like Bitcoin can benchpress a lot of weight, what we mean is channeling energy with force and acceleration. So forcefully channeling energy. That\u2019s what a gun is, right? A gun is one of the strongest offensive technologies because it can repel a bullet with more force and acceleration than a sling or a bow, so a gun is preferred. But in the realm of money it\u2019s all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration into the right place and the right time to generate yield, as we were talking about earlier with the lending market. And this is yet another way Bitcoin is superior to inferior stores of value like gold or equities, because with equities your custodian is gonna hold it, they may be lending your stock to short-sellers and generating yield for themselves. But as an industry standard they do not share that yield with you at all! They also do other weird things like rehypothecation and naked short selling and all types of fraud that are just industry norm today. But with Bitcoin, since it has such a high degree of mobility and visibility, you actually could demand that your custodian lend it to short sellers or do different things \u2014 put it into different buckets of risk to create yield for yourself as you see fit. And that\u2019s just something that you don\u2019t have the option to do with gold or with equities. Because Bitcoin is so mobile, it\u2019s this cross domain asset you can settle with finality anywhere near instantly. It\u2019s highly resistant to custodial collusion and regulatory capture, where the reason you don\u2019t get yield on your equities right now \u2014 whereas the bank does \u2014 is they\u2019ve colluded and made that an industry practice! So Bitcoin, by being this near-instant means of final settlement, it\u2019s collapsing the event of trade with the event of settlement, and it is between those events in traditional finance where all corruption and systemic risk accumulate. Because you can execute a trade but you don\u2019t have to settle with say T+3 or T+5 depending on the asset. And between those times a lot of games are played on Wall Street and in the broader financial landscape! Bitcoin closes that window. Trade and settlement are now effectively the same thing \u2014 you can demand final settlement 24/7 from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. So it just again speaks to Bitcoin\u2019s incorruptible character. Finally getting into how Bitcoin\u2019s faster: as Saylor described it, we\u2019ve essentially dematerialized gold, so we\u2019ve taken the monetary properties of gold but we\u2019ve transitioned them into a tool that\u2019s fully dematerialized, purely informational. And when you look at that through the Einsteinian equation lens of E=MC\u00b2, we\u2019ve taken M to zero \u2014 it\u2019s massless \u2014 so what we\u2019re left with is this massless money that can be moved at the speed of light! And that\u2019s just radically new and interesting. And as we talked about earlier it\u2019s also related to the security aspects. Because it\u2019s pure information you can do a lot of really unique things with it that just aren\u2019t possible with any other asset. So this dematerialization of money, it enables a plethora of high frequency and microtransactions that were simply not possible in the past. And the other thing is that again all of these gatekeepers in traditional finance are the ones taking the vig on market participants, but in Bitcoin we have this economic network that\u2019s bigger than even money \u2014 it\u2019s a global economic network that has almost no gatekeeping essentially, if you\u2019re just transacting peer-to-peer, and therefore has much lower transaction and taxation costs which means there are just less frictions to free trade overall. So this thing is just moving capital much more quickly and with much less friction and impedance. So all this means for market participants \u2014 for Bitcoin HODLers \u2014 is they have more optionality, they\u2019re gonna benefit from more aggregate wealth creation, and the wealth that they do create through this enhanced free trade, they can actually store it in a medium and preserve that wealth in essentially a theft-proof form, or a highly resistant to confiscation form. So all of these things just make Bitcoin much faster and much more securable and when you compare that to something like fiat you just can\u2019t move that off business hours, on holidays, and between countries unless you\u2019re suffering high fees. There\u2019s KYC/AML delays, there\u2019s just all of these frictions to doing business. Whereas Bitcoin you can just send it to anyone, from anywhere in the world, to anywhere in the world at any time of day, and that is just a radical enhancement to the speed or velocity aspects of money! That in a nutshell \u2014 Bitcoin being smarter, stronger, faster, and harder than any other money in history \u2014 is why Bitcoin is freedom money! It is a form of value communication, a language of value if you will, that cannot be muted or manipulated. A guy I talked with today actually called it a super-language object, which I think is interesting! We\u2019ve collapsed a lot of things into speech in the digital age, if you think say the 3D printing of firearms, we would say that\u2019s a 2nd Amendment right, the right to bear arms in the US. But we\u2019ve now collapsed that into the 1st Amendment because code is speech. And Bitcoin interestingly enough has collapsed money into speech, so something really big is going on here! And Bitcoin is at the center of it. And I hope this episode helps show you some of that. I\u2019m excited for the next one. This is Episode 6, we\u2019ve got 3 left and we\u2019ll see you next time!"}

Welcome to Episode 5 of The Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! Super excited for this one! This is episode 2 of us getting into Bitcoin theory, and things are just starting to really heat up and get interesting at this point! So it\u2019s a big episode \u2014 I don\u2019t want to waste a lot of your time here, I\u2019m just gonna run through a few of the topics that we\u2019ll be hearing today. If you haven\u2019t checked out Episodes 1\u20134 yet I suggest you do, because a lot of the foundation that we\u2019ve been building upon up until this point really starts to throw off some good energy here! So today we\u2019re going to be talking about money as power, also, talking about one of my favorite ways to describe money is as an insurance policy on the uncertainty or the entropy of the future. And then we\u2019ll also be looking at debt and how it\u2019s actually a form of anti-energy. And then Saylor delivers a really interesting take on fiat currency in that it\u2019s a way of politically toxifying money, and he drops some really interesting analogies there that I think you\u2019re gonna like. And then we\u2019re gonna deliver a thought experiment that I think is a really simple way of clarifying the value proposition of Bitcoin and its superiority as a store of value in comparison to all other assets. Maybe something you can use in your own arguments with precoiners. And then we\u2019re gonna be talking about some lessons of history and how essentially the most organized group of people tend to win out. We\u2019re gonna be looking at store of value versus medium of exchange in terms of monetary functionality. We\u2019re gonna look at the utility of money and how that tends to drive its market value. We\u2019re also gonna look at the productivity of market participants in a monetary network and how that drives market value. And then finally we\u2019re gonna look at Bitcoin as \u2014 you know, what I\u2019ve argued in the past and what we get into a bit here \u2014 is that Bitcoin is an American technology! Now I do not mean America the nation state, like it was invented in America, I mean the idea of America: the principles of free market capitalism. Bitcoin positively embodies them. Saylor and I get into a unique discussion on that topic. And then we\u2019ll look at and compare and contrast the nature of fiat currency inflation and Bitcoin appreciation and see how they\u2019re polar-opposite forces. And then we conclude by diving into some philosophy! We\u2019re talking a bit about truth and how Bitcoin relates to truth and civilization\u2019s relationship with truth. So, big episode today, excited for you guys to see this! Let\u2019s jump in!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-5-BON7cSMJjxV/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Michael Saylor [06:10]: We\u2019re talking about Bitcoin as the first digital monetary network! I\u2019m positing this thought experiment: I have a $100 Million block of energy. I can generate $100 Million worth of energy through chemical processes, kinetic, gravitational, electrical, atomic power. Let\u2019s just assume that I did some amount of work in order to generate that energy. I converted that energy into money. Money is the highest form of energy! Now I\u2019ve got $100 Million block of money! You can do a lot with $100 Million! It equates to about 3,000 lbs worth of gold, it converts to $100 Million of currency, and we could do the calculation in Bitcoin \u2014 a little bit less than 10,000 Bitcoin at this point in time. Now, I want to do two things with it: I want to channel it through time, and I want to channel it through space. The beauty of Bitcoin channeling through time is that there really is no loss over time, there\u2019s no inflation. You\u2019ve only got the 21 Million Bitcoin, so as a ratio to 21 Million it\u2019s infinitely hard! And so that\u2019s a big check, and if we contrast it to gold and fiat: you\u2019re gonna lose 99.5% of your energy in fiat. You\u2019re gonna lose 98% of your energy in gold. You\u2019re gonna keep all your energy in Bitcoin! So clearly, channeling energy through time is important and it\u2019s critical. Channeling it through space really refers not just to moving it around the world, but it means moving it across domains at well from counterparty to counterparty. We can see the inefficiencies in fiat counterparty to counterparty is: you\u2019re locked into 9-to-5 banking hours, you can\u2019t do big transactions on a Saturday, there are certain jurisdictions where you can\u2019t do transactions at all, you\u2019re always working through a counterparty which is its own risk. And of course if we go to gold, fiat is faster, but it\u2019s still got complexities. Gold is slower \u2014 it\u2019s gonna take a month to physically deliver gold, and so: super slow, super expensive. Neither fiat nor gold make nearly so much sense for channeling energy through time and space! I think that the best metaphor when I think about this is it\u2019s like I want to cross from London to New York City and I need to cross the Atlantic \u2014 and that\u2019s the journey. And if I\u2019m gonna do it with fiat currency it\u2019s like a big rubber raft with a leak in it, and I\u2019m gonna be continually blowing up that raft every day to keep it from sinking on me! And I\u2019m going to get battered this way and that way, and it\u2019s a bit of a venture! On the other hand with gold, it\u2019s like getting in a wooden ship. And it\u2019s gonna rot over the course of many many years, but maybe for the first 2, 3, 4, 5, years \u2014 compared to the rubber raft \u2014 I feel pretty good! But it\u2019s a heavy ship! Wood is heavier than rubber, so it\u2019s kind of harder to get going and it\u2019s harder to maneuver it but it\u2019s a bit more solid. But ultimately it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s going to decay! And then if I put it into a crypto container \u2014 a Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s like a steel vessel. I have a steel hull \u2014 a steel hull container ship really, is the best metaphor \u2014 1,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, moves 30 knots! The thing that\u2019s special about steel is: steel is indestructible as long as you maintain it! The maintenance means: you have to keep it from corroding! It can be attacked by a corrosion, and the way you maintain it is you paint it. You sand it down every 5\u201310 years, you repaint it. If you maintain it, it will last longer than you will last! In fact it will last essentially forever \u2014 hundreds of years! If you punch a hole in a steel hull and then you weld it, the weld is stronger than the original steel. So it is the indestructible, extremely strong, repairable element. And it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you\u2019re going to actually engage in commerce all around the world, you want a bunch of steel container ships! You do not want wooden ships, and you certainly don\u2019t want inflatables! And that\u2019s the distinction and that\u2019s why Bitcoin is really such an extraordinary invention! We talked about getting out of the gravity well \u2014 the other metaphor is: I have $100 Million worth of energy. If I can get it into a vacuum and vacuum seal it\u2014it\u2019s like when we want to keep food forever we vacuum seal the food\u2014we want to keep bacteria from attacking it. We want to keep natural parasites and pathogens from attacking our food energy! And so the way that you protect your food energy and stabilize it forever is you vacuum seal it! And the way you protect your monetary energy from parasites and from decay and from rotting is you vacuum seal it! And that is the genius of Bitcoin! When I say that the destiny is to be encrypted, it\u2019s like vacuum sealing your food. You\u2019re taking monetary energy in fiat that can decay, debase, diffuse, and you\u2019re encrypting it in an encrypted container such that no one else can touch it, no one else can screw with it. And when you think about all these miners, these miners are power plants, they\u2019re plugged into analog energy, but they\u2019re modulating the analog, physical, pure energy through the SHA-256 protocol to make it a wall of encrypted energy, if not a cloud of encrypted energy and the rails of encrypted energy! If you want to pass through that, if you want to attack that, you have to go through that wall of SHA-256 encrypted energy! And all of our monetary energy is protected and floating in the cloud behind that wall! And it\u2019s a fairly unique wall. And that\u2019s the majesty of Bitcoin."}

Already the most powerful computing network in the world! We\u2019ve never had something as cryptographically secure as the Bitcoin network!

And I guess that takes us to our next interesting question, which is: So how big can the Bitcoin network get? And how is it going to absorb more power? I\u2019m measuring: money is power \u2014by the way, the cliche, Money is Power, it\u2019s not a cliche! \u2014 it\u2019s a deep reality! Money is the highest form of power, the superset of all power. Kinetic energy?\u2014I can take bows and arrows and guns, club you to death and take your money \u2014 take your value! With a war, I can convert kinetic energy into power. Atomic energy into power. Chemical energy I can burn and create power. Gravitational energy \u2014 dam a river and create power. And ultimately that power becomes money! But I can\u2019t do the opposite \u2014maybe I can do the opposite \u2014 I can take a money and I can convert it back into the other things. But money is the amalgam of all powers that mankind has managed to collect! And so the question really is: How much money, how much power can fall into Bitcoin? And there\u2019s a lot of debate in the community. For example the most famous model is the S2F model. And a lot of Bitcoiners talk about stock to flow and it\u2019s like, Well, as Bitcoin gets harder, its price is going up! Well I mean the power in the network is directly proportional to the price because it\u2019s equal to 21 Million times the price! That\u2019s the power in the network! You could almost think of it as a voltage or something too \u2014 the higher the voltage, the more energy passes through the electrical network. So I see the price as the voltage, and I think that its stock to flow is an interesting transcendental model \u2014 a particular model \u2014 as we\u2019re moving through a short period, early history of Bitcoin, where the rate of block rewards is falling dramatically! But I think that as you look toward the future of the chain as it asymptotically goes to 21 Million and as the block rewards go to zero and the entire network flips over to transaction fees, then you start to think, Well just because it\u2019s hard, that\u2019s not gonna explain why it\u2019s valuable! [16:50] It\u2019s hard to synthesize Polonium or Uranium! By the way, it\u2019s really hard to create steel! Really hard! Like steel power plants, if the steel overflows, it hits the concrete, it blows up \u2014 kills everybody! It\u2019s hard to deal with nitroglycerin. There\u2019s a lot of hard things in the world. And there\u2019s some things that are nearly impossible \u2014 I will probably never walk on the sun! Impossible! But, the impossibility of something doesn\u2019t make it valuable. What makes it valuable is some other dynamics! And I have a simple model, and I Tweeted this model the other day: I think the success of Bitcoin and the network power ultimately is a function of the adoption, the utility, the productivity, and the inflation. Those four. And they\u2019re big brand concepts that are vectors, they\u2019re not like one number \u2014 they\u2019re ideas! But the adoption idea is: a monetary network is gonna be as big as the amount of asset holders that adopt it as their primary treasury reserve asset. So for example: if a million people with $100 each decide to HODL their $100 and they put $100 Million into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network\u2019s worth $100 Million! If a company $100 Million decides to HODL their $100 Million in Bitcoin, the lowbrow or the historic colloquial term is HODL \u2014 Hold On for Dear Life or just HODL or save, whatever \u2014 and the highbrow term would be, Adopt as a treasury reserve asset!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-5-BON7cSMJjxV/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Michael Saylor [18:46]: If I\u2019m filing an SEC statement I would say, We\u2019re adopting the treasury reserve asset! And if I was just a Bitcoin maximalist, I loved it and I got it \u2014 I\u2019m HODLing! And that\u2019s why I love the HODLers! That\u2019s why they\u2019re my people \u2014 I love them! They\u2019re HODLing! And they figured it out before I figured it out! And I give them credit: they figured it out and that\u2019s genius! But I\u2019m not too proud to learn. Some other \u2014 you gotta believe, if I looked a million years ago and some dude comes up with fire, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not the guy that\u2019s gonna say, I\u2019m not doing that \u2014 that wasn\u2019t my idea! Could I borrow some of that fire, Sir? And thank you! Thank you, for bringing life to me! So, adoption: the number of individuals and the number of entities that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 not measured in numbers, measured in monetary energy in whatever US dollar equivalents, but they\u2019re converting their fiat (Euros, Yen, Pesos, Dollars) \u2014 the total US dollar amount of fiat that is converted into Bitcoin for the purposes of holding as a treasury reserve asset! You see that the traders, the speculators \u2014 they\u2019re short term interesting, but over the long term they don\u2019t really have any value to the network, right? Someone that\u2019s going to buy $1 Million of Bitcoin today and sell it tomorrow? They\u2019re not going to drive network energy, because they\u2019re going to rob the network of energy as fast as they fed the network. They are mercenaries! The Roman Empire was built on citizen soldiers willing to fight and die to protect what they believed in! At the point that you\u2019re hiring mercenaries to fight and not die as long as you pay them \u2014 your empire\u2019s over! So, the HODLers \u2014 people that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 they\u2019re citizens of Bitcoin! They\u2019re citizens of the network! And if you decide it\u2019s 20% of your treasury reserves \u2014 like, it\u2019s a matter of faith! How committed are you? If you really committed like, say, Microstrategy \u2014 I had $500 Million worth of money I didn\u2019t need! I had two choices: I can buy the stock back or buy Bitcoin with it. Well I bought as much stock back as the shareholders wanted to sell to us, because that was the appropriate, respectful thing to do \u2014 to put a tender offer! And then whatever\u2019s left, we convert! The treasury is our reserve asset, which is our reserve energy! It is our life force! Treasury is life force! It\u2019s not unlike fat. Fat is nature\u2019s organic battery. You carry 30 lbs of fat, that means you\u2019ll probably be able to live an extra 60\u201390 days without food when the going gets tough! And so it\u2019s an organic battery. A treasury is an organic battery. Or it\u2019s a monetary battery for a family, an individual, a company, or a country! You have no treasury? You\u2019re gonna die very quickly when the crisis hits! You\u2019re gonna be insolvent!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-5-BON7cSMJjxV/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Robert Breedlove [22:24]: In some ways, through an economics lens, I often describe this as a cash balance. Whatever you\u2019re holding it in is basically an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future! Because this cash balance or this treasury reserve gives you pure optionality in the marketplace, you\u2019re best able to contend with unforeseen developments! Another thing, just to jump back to the power and money relationship, I think it\u2019s very interesting to look at power through the physics definition. Physics defines power as work over time! That\u2019s what gold was: it was reflective of our collective work over time, and it was a claim on that work over time in the form of capital! And the other thing\u2014you were drawing the analogy to the vacuum sealing to protect it from parasites \u2014 I think we could all agree that work is kind of the opposite of theft, right? You don\u2019t create any value by theft, you just steal the value of others\u2019 work. And that\u2019s essentially what inflation is! So, money being power, there\u2019s a big incentive to store it in a medium that is as much protected from theft as possible! And I think that\u2019s getting to the core value proposition of what Bitcoin represents!"}

It\u2019s an encrypted energy crucible in which we store the precious energy of life! And we\u2019re insulating it via an encrypted vacuum layer from all the things that would bleed off or steal that heat or steal the energy, be it a political exchange or just physical \u2014 there are a lot of ways to lose the energy of life! And Bitcoin solves that problem! Now how do we get energy into this system? There are a lot of metaphors for heat exchange, and if you look at closed systems, a closed system in thermodynamics is: mass cannot leave or enter \u2014 only heat! So let\u2019s assume that 21 Million Bitcoin is the mass\u2014it cannot leave or enter! Heat can come! If I\u2019m buying Bitcoin at a price higher than the rolling 3-year average, or the rolling 200-week average \u2014 I\u2019m heating it up! And if I\u2019m selling it at a price lower than the rolling average for whatever time frame you care about \u2014 let\u2019s say that 4 years is your time reference frame \u2014 if I\u2019m selling it at a price lower than the 200-week moving average, I\u2019m cooling it down! So people see Bitcoin trading day-to-day, and they\u2019re like, Oh it\u2019s lower than yesterday! That\u2019s not what I see! I see it as: If it\u2019s trading at $10,000 and the 200-week rolling average was $7,000, I see it heating up! I see its capacitor gathering energy! And that\u2019s a very important way to think of it. Now we come back to this issue of adoption: you can adopt Bitcoin with varying degrees of commitment. It\u2019s like joining a religion, right? So I adopt Bitcoin as my treasury reserve asset, and then do I commit 50% of my reserves to it? Or 1%? Or 99%? Or 100%? What is the true adoption rate? How much do you really believe it? Is it a hedge? Is it a 1% hedge \u00e0 la Paul Tudor Jones? Or is it a 100% commitment \u00e0 la Michael Saylor? Right? I said, No hedge! No speculation! 100% commitment! Just like your body is 100% committed to storing excess energy in fat! 100% commitment! There\u2019s no other thing! I like your analogy of an insurance policy, except that I would say: an all-powerful insurance policy with no caveats! Because the problem with most insurance policies is: I have an insurance policy on my restaurant, but it doesn\u2019t cover pandemics! And so I\u2019m bankrupt! Have you noticed how many insurance policies are not paying off in the pandemic? Because there\u2019s a carve-out: Well we only insure against a \u2014 only if this happens and that happens, and if you didn\u2019t do this and if nobody said that and if the government didn\u2019t do this, then in that case I will give you some money!"}

And I get to take the $99 Million and buy something else with it, but I\u2019ve assumed risk \u2014 I\u2019ve taken on counterparty risk in order to get the insurance policy.

And that\u2019s what is so deeply profound about Bitcoin is that it is a set of rules that we cannot break! It is an exception-proof money supply! And it\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve ever had! And by eliminating that attack vector such that any group could be sovereign over the money, it effectively makes everyone individually maximally sovereign! And that\u2019s one of the great breakthroughs of Bitcoin!"}

If you look at the corruption and the decimation, the destruction, in our society, and the devastation in our economy, there are two things that everyone fears: individual bankruptcy and corporate insolvency. Becoming insolvent as an individual or as an entity. How many times have you heard the story, That was a really good company, but they took on too much debt and they couldn\u2019t make their interest and they were broken up and they closed the factories and they moved away and now we\u2019re eat manufactured slop from a machine because our favorite vendor got destroyed. There are a lot of companies that get destroyed. How does it happen? Well they have treasuries in fiat, the fiat\u2019s inflating, so the CFO thinks, Well I cannot afford to invest this! It\u2019s not politically acceptable to invest in stocks or equity that keeps up with inflation. If I invest in bonds, I can\u2019t keep up with inflation, and so I start buying my stock back, and I borrow money to buy my stock back. So if I have $100 Million in treasury and I borrow $100 Million and then I buy back $150 Million worth of stock, I get the stock up, but now my treasury is -$50 Million in net treasury instead of +$100 Million, right? So I went from having a positive position\u2014it\u2019s like you have enough fat to live for 30 days without food, to a negative position \u2014 you have no fat, you\u2019re in debt, and there\u2019s a banker that clicks on a Feed You button every day, and if the banker decides to pull the plug on your credit line, you\u2019re instantly eviscerated! And so a company in debt with no liquid assets has no energy! It\u2019s in energy debt! So what that means is, Maybe you generate $100 Million in cash flow a year and you\u2019ve got $500 Million or $1 Billion in debt and you need $90 Million as EBITDA to cover the covenants. That means you have a $10 Million cushion! That means you have a $2 Million a quarter cushion! That means that in any given quarter, if you were short $3 Million on a $500 Million number, that $3 Million kicks you into default on your debt and renders you potentially \u2014 it renders your capital worthless! It can drive your equity to zero! And it can render you insolvent, you lose your sovereignty and the creditor can take control of your company \u2014 you lose everything! It\u2019s the same as: I go onto an exchange and I\u2019m trading at 50:1 or 100:1 leverage. The idea that I\u2019m going to pledge 1 Bitcoin and get control of 100 Bitcoin, and if it goes down by 100 bucks I\u2019m going to be utterly wiped out is a pretty silly idea! I would not recommend it to anybody other than an addicted gambler! If your goal is, I\u2019m okay losing all of this\u2014and that\u2019s just like going to Vegas or going to Bitcoinville \u2014 if that\u2019s what you want to do, then call it a gambling habit! But there\u2019s nothing rational about it! The leverage could be thought of as every entity \u2014 be it a government or a corporation \u2014 is draining their life energy, pouring it out, when you flip from having a positive treasury to a negative treasury. I have drained my entity of my life force, and I\u2019m living at the pleasure of my creditors or my counterparties, wherever and whoever they may be! I\u2019ve lost my sovereignty!"}

To your point, there\u2019s no adequate store of value, so people at the individual and corporate level are forced into the use of leverage! The assumption of debt! Because the real debt load is actually eroding via inflation over time, so there\u2019s an incentive to take on debt. But this is a very short-sighted strategy, because now you are hyper-exposed to the inherent volatility of the future! So once there\u2019s any form of shock\u2014COVID or any other form of economic shock \u2014 you can go to zero immediately! You get wiped out! Versus holding cash \u2014 makes you antifragile!

And the cash will actually be worth more over time! And that\u2019s what Jeff Booth points out. But every technologist knows this! If there was no inflation, the cash would buy more over time, and my entire simple monetary strategy would be: save cash and over time I\u2019ll improve. But in a currency war, the political system declares war on the currency and makes the cash toxic! And if it\u2019s 2% toxic, that\u2019s like injecting a mild drug into your veins. When it becomes 10% toxic, it\u2019s like a poison in your veins. When it becomes 20% toxic, this is like basically saying I\u2019m gonna put a healthy on chemotherapy, and I pump toxic chemicals through a healthy person\u2019s bloodstream, because current \u2014 current is like blood current \u2014 it\u2019s carrying the energy of life, the oxygen. Oxygen is energy. Your blood carries energy to keep you alive \u2014 currency is carrying energy! If a sovereign nation is injecting massive inflation into its own currency, it\u2019s injecting a toxicity into its own circulatory system, and it\u2019s somewhere between either \u2014 one metaphor is chemotherapy \u2014 another metaphor would be Type 2 Diabetes. I\u2019m injecting so much sugar into your system that your insulin response is failing and you\u2019re becoming insulin-resistant, and your body becomes diabetic and I give you metabolic disease because I am just pumping the liquidity too hard into the currency, which is the blood of life!"}

Toxic shock! The toxic shock of the system. But, let\u2019s move back to our happy subject! How does the Bitcoin energy network grow? Well, adoption! So a million people adopt it as their 90% treasury reserve asset and they have $1 Million each, and now you\u2019ve got $1 Million times a thousand is a billion, a million times a million is a trillion, right? So a million millions gets you to a trillion in the network, they put the money in the network and the network is the syndication of all of the treasury energy of the people that choose to adopt it as their primary treasury reserve. So when a million people put a million dollars in it\u2019s a trillion dollar network. When a thousand companies put a billion dollars in, it\u2019s another trillion dollar network, so now you\u2019re up to $2 Trillion! When a hundred companies put a billion in or $100 Billion in \u2014 you go the next level! So as individuals, families, private companies, public companies, government agencies, small governments, municipalities, states, small countries, mid-size countries, big countries, all the non-profit organizations \u2014 as they adopt this as their treasury reserve asset, they don\u2019t need to adopt it as their currency, medium of exchange! They don\u2019t need to adopt it as their unit of measure! As it becomes their store of value, their treasury reserve asset, as they adopt it, the network syndicates all their energy, and the decision of Apple to buy $100 Billion worth of it would accrue to the benefit of a million HODLers that bought $100,000 each or $1 Million each or $50,000 or whatever they bought! The beauty of it is that everybody is pro rata, pari passu benefiting. And it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to bring everybody else in, right? And it\u2019s a network effect, that as someone comes in, someone else comes in, the price moves up, the people that were in it get a benefit, and now we get to this next dynamic \u2014 with me pausing to say: without adoption, without people believing that this should be their treasury reserve asset, without that, you have nothing! So it\u2019s not enough to say it\u2019s just hard! People have to love Bitcoin more than they love gold, silver, Apple stock, Amazon, Facebook \u2014 whatever! By the way, we didn\u2019t touch on it much, but if we consider Bitcoin as an energy network versus Facebook or Apple as an energy network, the issue there is: I gotta look out 100 years and say, Will I be able to put $100 Million in Apple stock, hold it for 100 years \u2014 and what\u2019s my exposure? And of course your exposure is: income tax on the company, sales tax on their product, tariff exchanges, regulatory interaction, income tax on their employees, all sorts of other taxes you can come up with, plus many other regulatory actions including and likely being the ultimate regulation of these things as public utilities, because if they weren\u2019t regulated as public utilities, the richest guy in every city would be the guy that owns the electrical power plant! And that guy would be richer than Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or anything! The only reason that these guys are rich is because they\u2019re in a new novel unregulated area that was not deemed to be important! And the problem is, as soon as it is deemed to be important enough that you can\u2019t live without it, then it becomes a God-given right to have access to your YouTube or to your iPhone or to your whatever, and now the entire value proposition differs! I mean we live in a society right now where people think equity is the perfect store of value! What they don\u2019t realize is: it\u2019s possible for the equity to go to zero! For example, a nationalized power station has zero equity! It still works! When stuff gets nationalized, be it education, power, electricity, technology \u2014 the equity goes to zero! You can have something with an equity zero and the debt has value. You can have something where the equity has no value, the debt has no value, but the underlying vendors are getting paid. It can shift back and forth \u2014 it\u2019s a political thing! So with regard to Bitcoin and the value of the network, it comes down to people making the commitment to adopt it as their treasury reserve asset at all levels. It\u2019s just as good for us if Norway adopts it for their treasury reserve as it is some big charity as it is the Rockefeller Foundation or the Hughes Institute or Harvard or Stanford or MIT or for a private company or a public company or an agency of the government. Maybe the county or a city that you live in or the fire department or a union or a pension fund! And then there\u2019s all the investors, right? Hedge funds, pensions funds, insurance companies! There are a lot of entities that have monetary energy. They either need it to operate or they stored it up in trust for their shareholders or for future generations, etc. So as that energy flows, the network strengthens! Now that\u2019s the first order dynamic. It\u2019s simple network effect. We\u2019re syndicating our power. No different than \u2014 let\u2019s say that there are a hundred of us in a football field, and you organize 50 people to be on your tug-of-war team, and I can only get 5 on mine, and the rest are all singletons \u2014 your team wins! If there\u2019s a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins! Usually the Romans kicked everybody\u2019s ass for nearly a thousand years! Because they were the most organized! When they put their petty differences aside for 700 years, they beat everybody else. And then when they started fighting with each other there\u2019s the decay and eventually when they were disorganized, that disorganization causes a deterioration in power. So it\u2019s the most organized that wins. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in 8th grade football or whether you\u2019re in high school or in college. Whatever it is! Organization is always critical!"}

You do have to HODL or adopt it as a treasury reserve asset\u2014in an economic sense \u2014 to create reservation demand for that asset. You\u2019re taking that asset off the market. You\u2019re reducing its supply, thereby increasing its price. And that\u2019s what creates the bootstrapping effect, this monetization process. And that again hearkens back to this evolutionary path where you have it as a store of value first. After it\u2019s created enough value, it can be used as a medium of exchange, because those early HODLers had more of an incentive to use it as a medium of exchange. And then finally when its been widely accepted enough, it\u2019s being used as a unit of account. To your point about organization, HODLers are all perfectly aligned to 21 Million! It\u2019s just the energy efficient strategy is to just HODL! It\u2019s very simple, hard to disrupt, hard to disorganize because there\u2019s not a lot of activity on the part of the HODLer, so it seems like an indomitable strategy in the market for money!"}

The people that are trading in it don\u2019t really understand it, because if they understood it they would just buy it and HODL it! And sometimes people think they\u2019re accomplishing something, but they\u2019re accomplishing not that much! If a hundred entities buy $1 Billion each, then the value of the network\u2019s gonna go up by more than $100 Billion, and if they just buy it and park it in a cyber-vault and don\u2019t touch it for 100 years, it doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s going up! The fact that they poured their energy into the container is actually what caused the energy network to grow! The moving in and out is actually wasting and dissipating energy! You\u2019re just dissipating energy to come and go, and ultimately the success of the thing \u2014 I hear these people, they talk about store of value, medium of exchange. Well, Bitcoin is the high frequency store of value and a low frequency medium of exchange! That\u2019s what it needs to be and technically that\u2019s what it is! And if you understand that, once you get it, you realize you shouldn\u2019t fight that! So for example: I buy $1 Billion of Bitcoin. Every second, it keeps anybody from stealing my Bitcoin! Every second, it\u2019s storing the value! No government, no parasite, no thief, no hacker is taking my billion dollars every second for the next million years! It\u2019s working! In the same way that I put that energy into a vacuum package and every second it\u2019s staying vacuum sealed, and the whole point was to live forever! And so if I gave you a little crypto-field that made you live forever and never age, you would say, High frequency longevity device \u2014 it works pretty well! And you wouldn\u2019t have a problem \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with living forever! It\u2019s immortal energy! So that\u2019s high frequency. The problem is, people don\u2019t recognize that every second of the day they\u2019re being attacked. You are being attacked! Every second of the day there\u2019s bacteria and there\u2019s viruses trying to kill you! If I said, I\u2019m gonna spin up a field that stops them from killing you, it\u2019s gonna work a million years, and you\u2019re not gonna notice it \u2014 you would think that\u2019s a pretty good trick! But that is in fact what happens when you actually store value! Now, low frequency medium of exchange: in order for Bitcoin to have its antifragile properties and utility, we have to be able to move it on occasion. Maybe once a year I move it from one cyber crypto bank to another one, or one cyber vault to another one, or once a decade. Or maybe when I\u2019m gonna die I need to transfer it to somebody or split it between my daughter and my son. Or maybe not, maybe I just have one key and I give it to my one child. They give it to their one child, they give it to their one child \u2014 then it never gets transferred! Maybe once a year I have to take 5% of my Bitcoin out of my vault, convert it to fiat, and then break that into 100,000 little parts and put it on Apple Pay and use it to pay for Ubers and Domino\u2019s Pizza and credit card bills. Okay! Once a year I take a chunk out of my piggy bank, my crypto bank, and I put it into fiat, and I do whatever I\u2019m gonna do with it \u2014 maybe! And maybe\u2014if the world works the way you\u2019d think it might work\u2014I just put $100 Million into the vault, I never take it out, I just borrow against it! I just borrow $3 Million a year, $1 Million a year \u2014 tax free! I don\u2019t recognize income, I don\u2019t generate a capital gain tax, I don\u2019t generate an operating income tax. If I borrow money in cash and if my Bitcoin is going up 20% a year \u2014 that\u2019s the real yield\u2014and I can borrow money at 5%, then my effective arbitrage is 15%! So it never makes sense to sell it, ever! In fact, if you look at people that use real estate as a store of value, the way it works is, My family buys a block in Manhattan for $10 Million in 1900. It goes up 8% a year\u2014it doubles every 10 years. It\u2019s worth $20 Million, then $40 Million, then $80 Million, and then $160 Million, and by the time you get out 80 years, you got a billion dollars worth of real estate in Manhattan. You\u2019re not selling it! You haven\u2019t done one transaction in a hundred years! All you\u2019ve done is pledged it as collateral against the loan and you\u2019ve borrowed $42 Million against it and you\u2019re paying 3% interest. And that $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! You didn\u2019t pay 42% tax on $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! That\u2019s not a capital gain! It\u2019s not a long term capital gain! It\u2019s not a short term capital gain! It\u2019s a liability! You\u2019ve generated $42 Million of liabilities against a non-taxed asset. The only way it\u2019s getting taxed is you\u2019re just suffering from real estate taxes, right? But, if you\u2019re in a jurisdiction where inflation is high, real estate tax is low, interest is low, then your secret to living well forever tax-free is just borrow against your stationary assets! And so that\u2019s the news of this week: Donald Trump has $400 Million in debt and paid no taxes for a decade. But he\u2019s not unique! You could substitute every real estate magnate, a family that had generational wealth in real estate, they all did it! All of \u2018em! How do rich people live well and pay no taxes? Not by selling stuff! Not by transacting stuff! The way that they actually live is they just park an asset on the balance sheet, and they never ever ever ever trade it! They just finance it or borrow against it \u2014 and once in a blue moon, once in a decade, somebody wants to pay me triple what it\u2019s worth \u2014 and maybe I do it, but oftentimes, the Warren Buffett school of thought is, The taxes kill you! And so the ideal holding period for an asset is forever! He says it\u2019s forever like I\u2019m committed to it \u2014 yeah! But it\u2019s the taxes that murder you, and so the ideal holding period is forever because then you can pledge it and borrow against it. How do you get rich? You buy an asset, it goes up, you borrow against it to buy another asset, and it goes up, you borrow against it, you buy another asset, and it goes up, and pretty soon you\u2019ve generated all these assets that are highly appreciated with massive built-in capital gains that you\u2019re never ever gonna recognize! Obviously that can change in different types of jurisdictions where politicians decide they\u2019re just gonna tax you on unrealized capital gains, but \u2014"}

How frequently is the collateral marked to market? So for example, if you borrow money to buy a house and it\u2019s a 30-year mortgage and if the bank says to you, they\u2019re never gonna mark it down. Right? There\u2019s some loans like a mortgage loan where they\u2019ll never get marked down. They might get marked up \u2014 you can go to the bank and you can petition them to revalue your loan but nobody ever went to the bank and said, Mark my house to the market after the real estate market crashed! So if you buy a $1 Million house with an $800,000 loan, and you got $800,000 in debt and it\u2019s never marked to market then there\u2019s not that much fragility as long as you can make the $25,000 a year interest payment, assuming 3%, right? So that\u2019s not that risky \u2014 I mean a little bit risky, you can\u2019t make $25,000 and you lose it \u2014 but on the margin, if I didn\u2019t have the million bucks or I didn\u2019t have the $800,000 and somebody was willing to give me the $800,000 house for free, and all I did was pay $25,000 a year \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good trade off! The worst that happens is they take the house back and I go do it again somewhere else. So that\u2019s not very fragile! How does it get fragile? It gets fragile when you buy a $1 Million worth of stock on a $800,000 loan and you\u2019ve got loan-to-value of 80%. And now, the stock trades down 20%! And the stock trades down 20% and the banker marks the collateral every day. And if you\u2019re in a swap with the bank, they will mark it to market every day. Every single day, they calculate the value of collateral, and if you\u2019re under you have to wire them the money the next day! And if you\u2019re over, they in theory have to wire you the money! And you have to mark it to market every day \u2014 that\u2019s risky! So if you were gonna buy $100 stock, you probably don\u2019t want to borrow more than 50%, but if you borrow 50% you damn well better think that the volatility\u2019s not gonna be 50%! You can\u2019t afford to! So probably in that case, if you thought the volatility was that it could lose half its value, you\u2019d want to borrow no more than 25%! And if you wanted to hold the stock even if it loses 80% of the value you can\u2019t borrow more than 20% loan-to-value, right? So the big risk, the hyper-risk is one of these Bitcoin exchanges that go 100:1 in leverage and I mark to market every hour! What if I mark to market every minute, Robert? I mean that the BitMex liquidation! I basically bought 100 Bitcoin, I pledge 1 Bitcoin, it gets marked to market every minute, and if the price goes down $100 I get wiped out and there\u2019s a crash! And it happens in 3 seconds. So that\u2019s risky. If you want to take the opposite point of view, I have 100 Bitcoin and I\u2019m gonna borrow the equivalent of 1 Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin in value, and as long as it doesn\u2019t go more than 90% down, I\u2019m good. But if you wanted to save for one, you would say, I\u2019m gonna borrow against the collateral but I want you to agree that you won\u2019t ever mark it to market \u2014 that\u2019s what real estate loans are! Or a bank: I\u2019m gonna loan you money against your artwork or against your boat or against some other interesting collectible, and every year or every 5 years our appraiser is gonna reappraise it. So the issue is the frequency of the appraisal, combined with the volatility of the asset combined with the political regime you\u2019re in combined with the loan-to-value! If you\u2019re in a political regime where it\u2019s unacceptable to let real estate values go down, then you can reasonably expect that it\u2019s not likely your house is gonna be worth 20% of what you bought it for because the politicians won\u2019t let that happen! But they might not protect your Picasso painting! So if I borrowed money against a Picasso painting and the banker said we\u2019re gonna mark it to market every month, that\u2019s not as good as once a decade! So when you\u2019re thinking about risk, you\u2019re thinking about, How liquid is the collateral? And how frequent is the mark to market? And then how much is the loan-to-value? And that\u2019s how you get to a question of risk and what you should do and not do! I\u2019m not saying you have to do it, by the way! You could just sell the Bitcoin highly appreciated for cash, pay the tax, and take zero risk! And look, if the interest rate was 18% and you thought that the economy was gonna grow at 3\u20134%, then you would sell and you wouldn\u2019t take on the debt! So it\u2019s a function of interest rates as well, and productivity. Let\u2019s go back to this issue of our power equation: adoption, utility, productivity, inflation. We talked about adoption, and my point there was you\u2019re just syndicating \u2014 if the world was static, in a static world where there\u2019s $1 Trillion of assets, if you get $100 Billion on the network then that\u2019s better than $10 Billion! And $500 Billion is better than $100 Billion! And in a static world it\u2019s just all about recruiting and getting people to join the network. But the world is not strictly speaking static! The next thing is dynamic, and technology is what makes it dynamic! And that\u2019s where utility comes in! So if I can take Bitcoin and I can buy it from Square Cash, it\u2019s got more utility! If I can send it as $22 \u2014 if I can send it from Square Cash \u2014 if Square will convert my Bitcoin into dollars and send it in a split second, it\u2019s got more utility! If Apple Computer builds it into Apple Pay, and I can link a small wallet with 1% of my Bitcoin into Apple Pay and I can zap that around on my iPhone, it\u2019s got more utility! If Kraken creates a crypto bank and they offered me 4% interest and they\u2019ll offer it to me with institutional low-risk counterparty and they represent to me that they\u2019ve got $100 Billion of insurance and I can give them my crypto wallet and I get 4% interest on it or 6% and I trust them, the utility just went up again, and Bitcoin becomes more valuable! If I get to the point where I can manage my crypto keys using my retina scanner face ID and give speech instructions and I can say, Send Robert $37 of my crypto in cash \u2014 and if it always works and I just did it and it\u2019s more secure than a hardware key and I don\u2019t have to remember my 12 [word] seed key or whatever and it never fails \u2014 utility went up! Right? If I can say, Robert \u2014 maybe I\u2019ve got a girlfriend, Lisa\u2014 I could say, Send Lisa flowers on her birthday every year for the next decade \u2014 click! And it\u2019s jacked into my crypto\u2014utility went up! There\u2019s a lot of ways utility can go up. Buying stuff, selling stuff, etc. It\u2019s all a function of technology. If the Lightning Network works. In the ideal world, back to my example, I have X money \u2014 $10 Million \u2014 I have $100,000 in my checking account. I say, Move $100,000 in checking, leave the rest in the bank yielding 7% interest \u2014 tie my checking account into Apple Pay, link that to my Uber account, my sister\u2019s Uber account, my Domino\u2019s account, and use it to pay off Netflix, Google, this, that, and the other thing, and pledge it as trusted collateral on some dating network to show that I\u2019m a real person, and then use it to automatically pay all my fees on my domain registrations every year when they become due. There I just set it! I just did it \u2014 that\u2019s utility! That\u2019s [what we\u2019re looking for! 1:06:09]"}

Well we have a million HODLers and they put $1 Million each into the network and now we have $1 Trillion in the network. Adopting it as your primary treasury reserve assets means sweeping your excess cash flows into Bitcoin, so those million people put $1 Million each, but how much money do they make each year, and how much do they save each year? So let\u2019s say they make $100,000 a year, and they save $10,000 a year. So $10,000 times a million \u2014 $10 Billion! So in that case $10 Billion in fiat gets converted into Bitcoin every year! That\u2019s the productivity! If they all get a raise \u2014 next year it\u2019ll be $11 Billion. The next year it\u2019ll be $12 Billion. If they all start their own business, the near year it\u2019ll be $30 Billion. If the economy\u2019s growing and they\u2019re inventing cool stuff and one of them becomes the next Michael Dell or Bill Gates or whatever, that person\u2019s gonna put in $100 Billion or $50 Billion! If you get lucky and one of your HODLers is Jeff Bezos he\u2019s gonna put in $37 Billion! So the productivity of the individuals is going to sweep cash flows into the network. And the same is true with the productivity of the corporations! So Microstrategy, we put $500 Million into a network, we make $50 Million a year. If we generate $50 Million a year after tax, we sweep that into the treasury, right? And do that 10 years in a row, our initial $500 Million is going to become $500 Million more of discounted cash flow! So now we\u2019re just back to some basic finance theory: What\u2019s the value of the stock? It\u2019s equal to the balance sheet cash value plus the discounting of the cash flows. The discounted value of the cash flows over time! So, the treasury that gets put in is the initial slug, and the discounted value of the cash flows of all the people in the network is the next value proposition. Of course, this kind of dovetails nicely with economic theory, because if the overall worldwide economy is flat and not growing, then the cash flows are not gonna grow! If the overall economy tanks and starts to deteriorate, the cash flows will deteriorate! If I destroy the economy, cash flows are going to zero, no value will accrete! And if I invent an atomic overthruster that gives you infinite energy in a sugar cube, presumably productivity is gonna go through the roof and cash flows are gonna go through the roof! So ultimately we\u2019re getting a bunch of people to join the network and then all of our fates are intertwined with all of our productivities! We\u2019ve created a cyber economy! Just like Warren Buffett said, Never bet against the United States. The United States was a 20th century physical economy and every business in it was working to the benefit of every other business in a competitive capitalist Darwinian ecosystem. Well now we\u2019re actually creating a cyber economy where you can be in a relationship with anybody else to the extent that, Robert, you adopt as a HODLer and I adopt as a corporate treasurer! If I\u2019m successful, you benefit! If you\u2019re successful, I benefit! Obviously, if we can get Apple Computer to put $100 Billion in and then sweep $50 Billion a year, we all benefit! And when a country does it, they benefit. And of course, if the people that join the network are more responsible, if they actually are productive and they save more than they spend, or they earn more in revenue than they spend in cost, then the network grows. And if they spend more on revenue, flip it the other way \u2014 a million HODLers all of a sudden save their money and then they start going crazy and partying and quit their jobs and buy Lambos and blow it all on champagne and gambling, they start drawing down their balances in the Bitcoin network and they sell their Bitcoin for fiat! And if they\u2019re selling it for fiat they\u2019re draining it out of the network! So the network is going to accrete with virtuous economic behavior and debase and dilute with vices!"}

Because it was indeed a place in the world with the lowest impediments to free trade that actually led to America creating the most wealth and the most capital. And in many ways I think Bitcoin positively embodies a lot of the founding principles of American free market capitalism. You have inviolable property rights in Bitcoin, which in the American ecosystem actually marginally disrespected through Quantitative Easing and fiat currency printing. There\u2019s a rule of law here in the US, so we have non-violent dispute resolution and enforcement of contract law, and clearly the Bitcoin network is the most adept network at reaching global consensus we\u2019ve ever created! And then kind of from the first view, honest money or hard money would be something else that a real capitalist system puts out. So it\u2019s almost as if America as an experiment was the closest thing to pure capitalism we had prior to Bitcoin. Because again the nation state always gives in to that temptation to violate the money supply and thereby violate the private property rights of the citizens."}

I\u2019ve described Bitcoin as a swarm of cyber hornets behind a wall of encrypted energy. Well the United States is a swarm of military assets: the navy, army, and air force, behind a wall of water! The insulation is the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean! 3,000 miles of water \u2014 you have to go through the army, the navy, and the air force, and that protected a bunch of capitalists, a bunch of entrepreneurs. In service of the goddess of wisdom, in this case in service of the American way! The American businesses pursuing the American Dream unhindered by interruption because they\u2019re behind a wall of water. You know if you go to Poland, they\u2019re good people too! I\u2019ve been there! I have a lot of Polish employees \u2014 they\u2019re brilliant! Between Russia and Germany. Again, Trotsky\u2019s point, You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you! It\u2019s kind of hard to go about your business when people are rolling over you with tanks this way and that way. And the equivalent of that in a monetary system or an energy system is with someone stealing your energy! Okay? How do I keep my coffee warm? I put it in a thermos! I need to insulate my energy so that no one steals it! If I take your Starbucks coffee and I put it in a cooler of ice and I drop it in the ice your coffee\u2019s getting cold! And so the wall of encrypted energy is the insulator. The wall of water is the insulator. The insulator is the insulator. The vacuum is the insulator. If you want a crucible of virtuous innovation, you need that vessel that serves as the insulator against all the forces that would attack it from without or [within] from fear with this process. And that is Bitcoin, right? We\u2019re creating that! And having said all that, right: adoption, utility, productivity \u2014 those three things create that monetary chemical reaction of sorts. And the last piece is inflation. But inflation is almost just the way that we translate the energy \u2014 it\u2019s a translation coefficient of the energy into a frame of reference of the dimensionality or the domain where I\u2019m spending it. I mean, I\u2019m gonna have to translate my monetary energy into Rubles or Pesos of Dollars or Euros of Yen if I cross into one of those domains, because it\u2019s their world, not our world! So if the Dollar didn\u2019t inflate, then would Bitcoin go up? If the United States had a perfect monetary policy \u2014 no inflation \u2014 could Bitcoin succeed? Yeah! It could succeed! If people adopt it \u2014 because it\u2019s got technical advantages, right? If they adopt it as a reserve asset, I mean their choice is that versus stock versus bonds versus property \u2014 you still have the issue of: How do I commute energy through time and space? So I would still adopt it! Technology will still get better! I mean if there was no inflation you would still like the iPhone. You would still like Zooming to me if there was no inflation! Technology would get better, and we\u2019d have productivity! We\u2019d be inventing stuff: fusion, better materials, etc. And when we created stuff like Zooming and we put together Zoom with YouTube, we would talk, and someone would put it up on YouTube and 100,000 people would see it and 3 people would have an idea and something would happen that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise! You don\u2019t need inflation for Bitcoin to be successful anymore than you need it for Google or Apple or Amazon to be successful \u2014 it just happens that in an inflationary environment it accelerates \u2014 2% inflation will grow it 2% faster, 10% inflation will grow it 10% faster \u2014 in theory if a bond is pure energy and if bonds are inflating at 20%, then that means that Bitcoin will have a 20% real yield in that currency where you see that energy inflation! And it\u2019ll be different relative to the frame of reference of every single domain or every country depending upon how they choose to manage their currency. They could in theory \u2014 I could peg the Dollar, like in Singapore or the UAE I peg to the Dollar. I could peg to gold. If I peg to gold, it\u2019ll be a 3\u20134% differential. If I peg to the Dollar it could be a 10\u201315% differential. If I peg to the Peso it could be a 32% differential. So all of the value of Bitcoin relative to the people in the ecosystems in the domain will vary! And of course, that\u2019s why if I\u2019m in Lebanon or Argentina, this is even more insanely valuable to me than if I\u2019m in Switzerland!"}

I would just maybe add that 2% inflation would increase adoption say by 2%, but as you increase the inflation rate, I think it would actually be non-linear, because if you take the extreme example of hyperinflation, everyone would pile out of their currency into the Dollar or into Bitcoin \u2014 something that was more reliable, such that, as you increase from say 2% to 10%, people\u2019s inflation expectations actually increase, which gives them further incentive to move into Bitcoin or something alternative."}

You can\u2019t create more of it! If I give this much to you, you can\u2019t wiggle your fingers and make it twice as much! If you lose it, it\u2019s gone! And you can play all these games and thermodynamics \u2014 it\u2019s a great field because everybody thinks \u2014 they\u2019re all looking for that perpetual motion machine. The laws of thermodynamics, we used to paraphrase them at MIT in a snarky way, we\u2019d say, You can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t break even, and you can\u2019t get out of the game! The laws of thermodynamics! It\u2019s like, from a layman\u2019s point of view: You can\u2019t cheat! There is no cheating in thermodynamics! It might look like you got something for nothing \u2014 even Maxwell\u2019s demon. He posed, Maybe I could actually fight or reverse entropy and get order from disorder by dividing a chamber and I have a demon and there\u2019s a little door and molecules are bouncing around, and what if my demon opened the door when the molecule bounced from the right to the left and closed it before the [molecule] bounced from the left to the right? I could over time with randomness get all of the bouncy molecules on one side of the chamber and I could reduce entropy. And they couldn\u2019t figure that out! They called it Maxwell\u2019s demon. Well what\u2019s wrong with that argument? Doesn\u2019t that break the laws of thermodynamics? And the answer came along 100 years later when some IBM computer scientist pointed out that information is building up in the head of the demon, and the information is in and of itself creating entropy, and so no you\u2019re not cheating! Once you actually account for all the information, disorder, and energy in the system, it did respect the laws of thermodynamics! You can\u2019t cheat time. You can\u2019t cheat space. There is ultimately conservation! And Isaac Newton \u2014 all of Newton\u2019s laws: conservation of mass, conservation of energy F = ma, it\u2019s the basis of physics, the basis of mechanics, the basis of every machine we\u2019ve built that works, it\u2019s the basis of all of our heat exchange, and it hasn\u2019t been \u2014I mean scientists and engineers don\u2019t have a high opinion of economists. And one of the reasons why is that it hasn\u2019t been important for economists to understand closed systems, isolated systems, servomechanisms, conservation of mass and energy, E = mc\u23032. E = mc\u23032 matters! What it means is: If there\u2019s mass, it becomes exponentially expensive to move it around. E is the energy! You wanna move stuff fast? You need to take the mass to zero! And that\u2019s how you move stuff fast! So economists, maybe what they were doing didn\u2019t matter before Bitcoin! You could say, maybe Bitcoin is the first time that technology crashed into economics! You have energy, you have technology, you have math crashing into economics and now you couldn\u2019t really be a competent economist without appreciating closed systems, energy efficiency, math, conservation of everything!"}

Another thing this calls to mind and maybe a unique way to look at Bitcoin: We can\u2019t break the laws of thermodynamics. Those are the rules of the game within which we are operating in physical reality. And Bitcoin in a way maps onto that system very nicely, because it gives us an economic system in which we cannot break the laws. It perfectly respects and aligns itself with the laws of thermodynamics in the economic sphere! And another thing this made me think of was \u2014 this was a framework I got from you on inflation \u2014 was that, CPI is low, but everything you want is inflating rapidly. You could probably plot that on a spectrum as, The things that are more energy intensive to create are inflating more rapidly, and the things that are created easily are tweaked and controlled and dumped into that CPI bucket!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-5-BON7cSMJjxV/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:30:15]: Alright guys! That was Episode 5 of the Saylor Series and, man! What a big episode! We hit on some major concepts today! I just thought it was super interesting, as always! Mr. Saylor brings the heat! I think first of all we talked about how fiat currency is basically implemented as a means of augmented the portability of gold, because gold is heavy and physical, it\u2019s difficult and expensive to transact it across space, although gold is really good at holding its value across time and has a high relative scarcity. But the point there that Saylor brought up was, Although gold-backed paper currencies were great at moving value across space \u2014 that was their purpose of introduction \u2014 they actually suffer because they have all of these frictions between different regulatory and intermediary environments, such that when you try and move cash from say China to the US, you hit different types of capital controls and whatnot. So it can be very expensive and cumbersome to actually move fiat currency across different jurisdictional domains which actually inhibits its original purpose, which was to increase the portability of money! And I like the analogy he drew with a boat: If you consider that the moving value across space function of money is something like putting goods on a boat and selling it across the sea, he\u2019s saying effectively that gold was dingy\u2014very unlikely to move value across space well, whereas fiat currency might be something more like a wooden ship \u2014 a little bit better at doing that but still not idea, whereas Bitcoin is actually like a steel ship \u2014 it\u2019s an extremely strong protocol and as long as you maintain the steel by painting it it\u2019s basically indestructible. The analogy there being: So long as Bitcoin is maintained by the mining network \u2014 which generates its revenue through the block revenue and the transaction fees \u2014 that essentially makes the monetary network itself self-reinforcing and indestructible in a lot of ways. And then the last analogy is that steel is super repairable! If you weld a steel plate onto the hull of a ship, the weld actually has a higher tensile strength than the original steel itself, which I think again analogizes [to] Bitcoin, is that: It can absorb superior competitive features from the marketplace, so it can actually repair or improve itself in a way that makes it even stronger than its original form. So that was a great analogy! And the other one that I liked that we touched on was the vacuum sealing of food, which if you think about it it\u2019s just a way of restricting the stored energy \u2014 whether it\u2019s food or money \u2014 from contact with entropy of the environment. In the case of vacuum sealing, we\u2019re removing all of the air \u2014 all of the microorganisms that might exist in that air, water, or moisture \u2014 from the package itself, such that none of them can attack the energy content stored therein. And the analogy there being: Getting the entropy or uncertainty out of the monetary channel. We can think of the SHA-256 algorithm as an encrypted vacuum sealing of the monetary energy stored in the Bitcoin network. So it gives it this super-high resistance to impurities or uncertainty or nefarious actors \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even have to be nefarious necessarily depending on your perspective on central banks\u2014but it gets the uncertainty out of your money! So it gives it this energetic vacuum seal, so I thought that was a really cool analogy too. [1:34:38] And we talked about money being power. And that money itself is this superset of all power that humans have been able to create in the world. Again the physics definition for power which I really liked \u2014 because it ties back to the importance of proof of work \u2014 power is the capacity to do work over time. So to be able to apply force over distance over time \u2014 that\u2019s what power actually means. It makes sense that we would generate power, or be able to allocate energy into a power storage network through proof of work. That\u2019s what gold mining was, and that\u2019s what the mining expenditure related to Bitcoin is! So we think of money as this amalgam of all the powers that human beings have had over time and looking at Bitcoin through that lens, we see that the power of the network \u2014 which was another analogy that Saylor used was the voltage in a closed source system \u2014 so the supply of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t move, but the amount of energy stored in the network is the only thing that can be increased! So it\u2019s a perfectly closed system that mass can neither exit or leave, but only energy can be added to it! In that way we can think of the power of the Bitcoin energy network as its price, effectively. We dug in a little bit in that and talked about stock to flow model and Bitcoin supply issuance. It\u2019s not actually the supply that is driving the value necessarily \u2014 as we go into later \u2014 it\u2019s more a function of its utility. Because as Saylor said the impossibility to produce something is not what makes it valuable, it\u2019s actually the impossibility of producing something that already has relevance to someone\u2019s goal-directed action! So value is this subjective quality where if a particular object or even a service or a piece of knowledge is relevant to you accomplishing the aims of your goal-directed action \u2014 if it\u2019s an accelerant for you towards you achieving your goals \u2014 then we can say that thing has value! Even if something is an accelerant towards you achieving your aims \u2014 say like oxygen, we all have the aim of breathing and surviving \u2014 it doesn\u2019t actually have a lot of value because it has no scarcity! So the scarcity can amplify the value, but the value itself is actually a function of the individual good, service, or knowledge\u2019s relevance to your goal-directed action. So we actually put it in these buckets of what actually defines the monetary network value of Bitcoin. And he classified it as: adoption, inflation, utility, [and productivity]. And I loved this quote he used. He said that Bitcoin is, \u201cAn encrypted energy crucible in which we store the energy of life.\u201d So we touched on it repeatedly in this show that money is life force. It\u2019s this meta-energy that allows us to access essentially any other form of energy that\u2019s available in the marketplace. [1:38:08] And in that way we need a system that maps onto the scarcity of the thing that it represents, if that makes sense. So in thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so it makes sense that the money which best maps onto that will become naturally selected in the marketplace! And then we went into another definition of money\u2014and this is one I\u2019ve used several times. I say that, Money is an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future. The ineradicable uncertainty of the future! No matter how much technology advances, we\u2019re never going to get rid of uncertainty! Uncertainty itself by the way is another expression of entropy! We live in a universe pervaded by entropy, and in fact entropy is the only thing that defines the flow of time in the universe. Everything \u2014 often these processes are symmetric \u2014 but the one thing that imparts a directionality to time is this flow of entropy: things left unmaintained becoming increasingly uncertain or breaking down or more chaotic over time. So money, since it gives us pure optionality in the marketplace \u2014 it\u2019s like, no matter what unforeseen consequence we encounter, money is the best tool for dealing with that uncertainty, because it gives us a claim on the collective savings of the world! So we can access whatever it is we may need\u2014assuming it\u2019s available in the marketplace\u2014to resolve that uncertainty when we encounter it. And Saylor made a good caveat to this analogy because he said that one thing about an insurance policy is that it carries a lot of counterparty risk. So even today we\u2019re sitting in 2020 with this global pandemic striking, many insurance policies are not being paid out because it had exclusions for a pandemic or other force majeure I guess they call a lot of them. So we could say that Bitcoin is actually even more valuable than just a standard insurance policy in that it\u2019s a non-counterparty insurance policy! It\u2019s a money that does not have any political exposure to pay out. So if you\u2019re holding cash in a form that can\u2019t be confiscated, inflated, stopped, then no matter what eventuality you encounter or what circumstances you encounter in dealing with the uncertainties of life, you have a pool of pure capital optionality with Bitcoin! And that cannot be said for any other asset! There is no other money that can provide you that degree of assurance! [1:40:53] I mentioned that quote from Carl Schmitt that, Sovereign is he that decides the exception, so this really important because by totally removing counterparty risk from money, Bitcoin has removed all exceptions from money or the monetary policy if you will. And by doing that, you\u2019ve taken away the ability to make exceptions in the game of Bitcoin, so all of a sudden\u2014Sovereign is he who can make the exception \u2014 if no one can make the exception, then no one\u2019s sovereign so there\u2019s no sovereign over participants in the network, which means you\u2019ve maximized the individual sovereignty of all network participants! And this is something that\u2019s really radical! You really have to think about this for a long time! Again we could define sovereignty somewhat simply as just, The authority to act as one sees fit. The ability to conduct an action consistent with your purpose of aims. And Bitcoin\u2019s the only money in history that maximizes our ability to do that! As I argue in one of my latest pieces, Bitcoin is Hope, that Bitcoin is money purpose-built for entrepreneurship. It maximizes not only their sovereignty but also their accountability, and their ability to engage in adventure! To engage in business dealings and taking on risk to try and solve problems for the market and generating value in the process. So I thought that was a really interesting way to look at it. And then we got into debt, and I love the way he described debt as almost an anti-energy, where you\u2019ve actually, instead of having this capital cushion against uncertainty, that debt actually can amplify the negative consequences of encountering uncertainty! Now it can also be used to enhance the positive consequences! That\u2019s what leverage is, that\u2019s what amplifies gains or losses, but it tends to be a poor strategy over time, because the one thing that\u2019s unavoidable in an entropic universe is volatility. It makes positive volatility more beneficial, but it can make negative volatility cause you total destruction. It puts you at risk of ruin, which if you\u2019ve any of Taleb\u2019s work, it\u2019s just the number one thing we all must avoid! We got into some specific examples of how fiat currency \u2014 because it\u2019s depreciating over time and large corporations have access to really cheap loans, it\u2019s actually incentivizing them to take negative treasury positions! To borrow money on the market at low rate and buy back their own stock, because again you would expect that the scarcity of that stock and the performance of the underlying capital tend to outperform the borrowing cost in a market where the cost of borrowing is suppressed by central banks, effectively. [1:44:13] So this puts corporations in a weird position because the incentive structure is such that it\u2019s causing them to fragilize their own business model into \u2014 instead of having a positive buffer against uncertainty in their treasury they\u2019re actually carrying negative treasury balances \u2014 which can make them subject to their creditors! The wishes of their creditors, which again \u2014 Sovereign is he who makes the exceptions. All of a sudden, by marginalizing your own capital position and putting yourself in the hands of creditors you\u2019ve now given away your sovereignty in the world to your creditor, and taken it away from yourself and your shareholders. So I thought that was brilliant as well! And then we went into the politics of currency, and this is another way to look at the importance of Bitcoin is that people for years have talked about getting the money out of politics. If we get the money out of politics that would make for a more fair equitable system, but Bitcoin\u2019s gonna flip that on its head! If you\u2019re getting money out of politics, that would require legislating away human nature somehow which in a way that\u2019s not possible! What we would do instead with Bitcoin is just get the politics out of the money. All of a sudden we have a money that can\u2019t be manipulated or confiscated based on political will. And Saylor\u2019s analogy here is that politics actually toxify the currency. And we could think of Quantitative Easing or monetary inflation is actually like putting a healthy individual on chemotherapy just to enrich the physician \u2014 the physician being the government! The physician is administering this \u201cmedicine\u201d to the patient, but the patient \u2014 being the productive economy \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually need it! Quantitative Easing again is not infusing any new value into the economy, it\u2019s just reallocating it away from those holding the fiat currency as a store of value to those holding assets that inflate: typically real estate, stock, reliably scarce assets. So the other part of that is that over time this analogy holds because like even sugar or drugs like maybe heroin or chemotherapy \u2014 it loses its efficacy over time! So the stimulative effects of fiat currency inflation actually diminish over time as well! And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing today in 2020 is that central banks have pushed all the levers to the metal so to speak and they\u2019re getting very little economic response as a result. And through that biological lens we can consider hyperinflation as being a form of socioeconomic organ failure or a toxic shock where all of a sudden these energy centers\u2014in the form of our institutions or economic networks\u2014the life blood that flows through them in currency has been so diminished in terms of its informational energetic carrying capacity that the institutions start becoming unraveled! People can no longer interoperate between themselves and between these institutions. The trust that maintains the social cohesion is basically diluted along with the currency! I thought that was a great way to look at it as well. And then this \u2014 I just think this is just a wonderful argument \u2014 this next point \u2014 on how to just diffuse anyone\u2019s counterpoint to Bitcoin! Assuming they have a relatively sophisticated understanding of a store of value function\u2014and it\u2019s just a very simple thought experiment: How do you store value effectively for 100 years into the future? How can I store value today in the most lossless way to transmit it 100 years into the future? So we could say, Alright, what\u2019s being used today as a store of value? FAANG stocks or other high-performing equities! They\u2019re being used today \u2014 why not those? So the problem with those is that clearly by owning an equity you\u2019re taking on industry, regulatory, and counterparty risk. There\u2019s not really many equities you could\u2019ve invested in 100 years ago that would still hold their value today! Maybe none actually\u2014I could be wrong on that! But very very few, so you\u2019d have to be the stock picker of the century so to speak for that to work. So you\u2019d say, Ah well let\u2019s look at something like real estate! Real estate also suffers from all of those issues! It does have reliable scarcity but it\u2019s an asset that\u2019s out in the open, it can\u2019t be hidden, in the event of a war or an escalation of property taxes or even just outright confiscation as in the US with Eminent Domain \u2014 your property could just be taken away completely! Even if it worked perfectly, say you\u2019re paying a low property tax rate of 2% a year, you\u2019re still getting cut in half every 35 years! So that\u2019s not a very effective way. So historically the most trust-minimized asset or trustless store of value was gold. But as we covered in the last episode, gold has 2% inflation per year. If you\u2019re trying to circumvent the counterparty risk related to it you need to move it every quarter or every few years. That can be another 25 basis points to 1% per year. So now even looking at gold as the hardest economic store of value historically, you\u2019re talking about getting cut in half every 22\u201335 years, and over a 100-year period you\u2019re approaching a 90% loss of value. You could say fiat currencies \u2014 the US Dollar! The US Dollar is strong today, but I would argue that there\u2019s scarcely a worse choice than that! That is the wealth storage medium that least holds its value over time. I think your best case of holding a fiat currency for 100 years \u2014 at least the past 100 years, say in the US Dollar you\u2019re above 99% total loss of value \u2014 and that\u2019s if you pick the right currency and yours doesn\u2019t hyperinflate or is invaded by another country and deauthorized or whatever it may be. So you\u2019re somewhere between 99%-100% loss of total value in fiat currency. So what does that leave you with? It leaves you with Bitcoin! There\u2019s only one store of value that is totally free of counterparty risk, has a fully diluted or a universally transparent and predictable supply schedule \u2014 so we all know the inflation, there\u2019s zero unexpected inflation \u2014 and it can be stored in any number of ways in these custom, ultra high security custody schemas like multisig and things of that sort! So I think if you just zoom out on the store of value argument, it\u2019s a clear winner! There\u2019s just not even competition! I mean your second best choice is maybe I guess gold or possibly real estate, and you\u2019re still looking at \u2014 say in the case of real estate, if everything went perfectly and you only had your 2% property tax per year, you\u2019re looking at an 87% total loss in 100 years! Whereas Bitcoin you have essentially 0%! It\u2019s not that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have inflation in the system, but the inflation is a fully-diluted cap table if you will. Everybody knows what it is! So you\u2019re playing off of 21 Million even though only 18.5 Million Bitcoin have been issued so far to date. So I thought that was brilliant! A great way to look at it. Zoom out! In the store of value area, Bitcoin is \u2014 undisputed \u2014 the best contender! I mean the one argument against it would be that it\u2019s new! It\u2019s only 12 years old, so how could argue that it\u2019s gonna last for 100 years \u2014 and that just comes down to faith and the existing track record of Bitcoin and the protocol and the math defending it. So it\u2019s not a surefire bet, but assuming Bitcoin continues to function in the same flawless way it has to date then it\u2019s not even a contest! Bitcoin is far and away the best store of value! [1:52:55] So that goes into a discussion about history, and Saylor made the point that the greatest lesson of history was that the most organized group of people win. Clearly, right? We are more than the sum of our parts when we can coordinate our efforts! And again, by getting the politics out of money, Bitcoiners are essentially perfectly aligned! We can compete and fight amongst ourselves and argue and all of these things, but the one thing that doesn\u2019t change, that\u2019s not subject to politics, is 21 Million, no confiscating, only private keys can generate and spend transactions \u2014 these fundamental rules of money that are not subject to politics enhances the cohesion of Bitcoiners, effectively. And so that\u2019s another perspective on why Bitcoin wins! It\u2019s just gonna have a more organized, more disciplined human force behind it! And the way it \u2014 I Tweeted this the other day \u2014 and this gets back to the Sun Tzu thing, Territory is the most decisive factor in determining the outcome of any battle. And as Bitcoiners, the moral, intellectual, and philosophical high ground that we occupy is virtually unassailable! So in my mind that\u2019s why we win! We are operating from a place that is the most protected and gives us the most optionality against all competing systems, and therefore that causes Bitcoin to outcompete all of the other systems over time! That\u2019s just Darwinian. And then going back into the SOV store of value versus medium of exchange argument, Saylor had a brilliant way of describing this, that, Bitcoin\u2019s a high-frequency store of value and a low-frequency medium of exchange! So that every second you\u2019re holding Bitcoin, it\u2019s performing its function! Anyone that\u2019s saying Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have utility, they don\u2019t understand inflation. They don\u2019t understand store of value. Because every second you\u2019re holding Bitcoin and it\u2019s adhering to that fixed and diminishing supply schedule and you\u2019re storing it in a custody model that\u2019s really difficult to confiscate or to corrupt, it\u2019s performing its function! It\u2019s storing your monetary life energy in an encrypted vacuum sealed container! And one of the things he said there was, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin is immortal energy! We\u2019ve never had anything like this! And this too got into how preserving this wealth will impact Bitcoin\u2019s relationship with fiat currency. So Bitcoin \u2014 which is historically yielding about 200% annually \u2014 if you can go out into the market and borrow at 5%, you have an incentive to never sell! You have an incentive to just keep accumulating Bitcoin and borrowing up to these intelligent thresholds, of ideally never being marked to market, and having favorable loan covenants. The incentive is to borrow, and acquire Bitcoin! Again he analogized this to how generational wealth is handled, where a lot of families just own, say, a block of New York City, and they just borrow against it little by little over time. So Saylor\u2019s point is, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin operates as this immortal energy. And the incentives related to Bitcoin are interesting because historically it\u2019s been yielding say 200% annualized return, so if you can go into the marketplace and borrow let\u2019s say 5% or anything below the annualized return, then you actually have an incentive to do so! To actually go out and borrow and acquire more Bitcoin! And more recently \u2014 this was recorded before Saylor\u2019s latest announcement most recently \u2014he actually used Microstrategy\u2019s balance sheet to go out and raise some convertible notes and do this very thing! Where he can borrow at a rate below Bitcoin\u2019s expected annualized return, and he\u2019s using it to acquire additional Bitcoin! And this points toward something really interesting: Pierre Rochard wrote a great piece about this years ago. I think it\u2019s called Speculative Attacks. And so what\u2019s effectively happening is that, since Bitcoin tends to outperform broader investment indices, and since debt and interest rates are being artificially suppressed by central banks, this opens up an attack vector on the fiat currency itself where market activists can go out into the marketplace, borrow fiat, and then actually sell that fiat to acquire Bitcoin! And if you do this at scale, this can actually induce inflationary pressure on the fiat currency undergoing the speculative attack. So this is to say: Saylor\u2019s recent move with the convertible note play is in some ways a speculative attack on the US Dollar! So again it just points towards how the economic principles underpinning money and the incentive schemes related to both fiat currency and Bitcoin sort of all point towards the ultimate success of Bitcoin in the long term! Then we got into the utility of money. It was another one of these factors that drive Bitcoin\u2019s success. And the general point here is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s: Bitcoin is extensible. Meaning, it\u2019s protocol is adaptable. You can add other features to it, you can build businesses on top of it, you can connect APIs to it. There\u2019s a great degree of programmability that Bitcoin enables that something like gold just does not! Gold is this dumb rock that essentially just sits in a vault and provides assurances of supply scarcity, but offers none of the feature sets that Bitcoin enables! And looking at it as technology, we can also say of fiat currency, it suffers because it has these technology backdoors in the form of issuers being able to inflate the supply and steal wealth from everyone else. Whereas something like gold or Bitcoin does not! It has these backdoors closed! And this spins up a number of interesting possibilities with Bitcoin which Saylor went into in a little more detail, but basically, by interfacing this base monetary protocol that we call Bitcoin with digital technology, we now gain a huge degree of customizability and unique ways to channel our will or intent across time and fund it in many unique ways. And you can do this with things like smart contracts that actually mitigate or minimize counterparty risk. Whereas if again you wanted to send flowers to your niece on her birthday every year for 100 years after your death, to do that with something like gold you\u2019d have to put all your trust in a custodian and some type of payment mechanism to get to the flower delivery guy, and then the flower delivery business itself you\u2019d have to bet on one that was gonna stay in business! Whereas with something like Bitcoin you can actually write a lot of these things into the code or into the smart contract that can go into the marketplace and search for say a good payment service to deliver the payment, a good flower delivery service. So it gives you a much higher degree of adaptivity and resiliency and projecting your will and intentions beyond the grave if you will, so super interesting way to look at Bitcoin. And then he touched on another aspect of Bitcoin that really drives its valuation, and he was referring to the productivity of the Bitcoin network participants themselves. So when market actors \u2014 whether they\u2019re individual, corporate, or government \u2014 have decided to go long Bitcoin, they\u2019re making a similar decision to what Saylor did, where they\u2019re deciding to use Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, or said differently, just to hold it on balance sheet as a means of storing wealth. And what this does is that this is a two-phased approach because the initial phase is, Hey, I\u2019m putting my treasury into Bitcoin. I\u2019m selling the cash and buying Bitcoin. But the second-order effect of that is, once you\u2019ve made that decision, you as a productive and effective entrepreneur are going to continue sweeping profits or excess cash flow into your treasury over time! So not only is the value accreted to the Bitcoin network \u2014 it\u2019s not even that initial slug of capital in the form of the treasury transaction \u2014 but also the discounted future expected cash flows from future sweeps into that same treasury! And I think this is an incredibly way of looking at it, because I\u2019ve never seen anyone in Bitcoin that studies it closely that becomes bullish \u2014 that ever becomes less bullish! So it\u2019s almost like once you\u2019re allocating capital in and you\u2019re studying it more closely and you see all of these things we\u2019ve covered in depth and more things we will cover on how significant of a monetary innovation this really is, and it just causes you to escalate your allocation into your treasury. Maybe 20% of your treasury initially and creeping up to 30, 40, 50%! And this is all just a self-reinforcing feedback loop, because every decision you make to increase your allocation of Bitcoin is putting game theoretic pressure on all other market participants to do the same! It\u2019s a game of frontrunning or taking as much territory on the network as possible! So this has a really interesting effect of intertwining the fate of Bitcoiners together in a way that \u2014 it\u2019s like a compounding incentive structure that incentivizes us not only to become more productive to generate even more free cash flow to put into this superior savings technology, but it also incentivizes us as HODLers to want to educate others! We want to describe to the rest of the world \u2014 not only for financial purposes but also for moral purposes \u2014 how the existing system is rigged! And you are being robbed! And this is not only pragmatically the best system but also philosophically the best system for savings the world\u2019s ever had! And even evangelize! Once you\u2019re a Bitcoin HODLer and you\u2019ve found this way of saving your own wealth \u2014 your own life energy \u2014 in an uncompromisable medium across time, you want the same for others! The natural human proclivity towards helping one another I think comes to the surface in that you want others to succeed in the same way because why would you want anything else? Actually\u2014other people succeeding in true free market economic competition \u2014 it\u2019s a positive sum game! Every time someone\u2019s doing something better, faster, cheaper, that solution they\u2019re providing accretes to all of us! So Bitcoin really\u2014not only does it intertwine all of the fates of its network or market participants, but it\u2019s also encouraging all of us to think differently and communicate differently! Versus a fiat currency paradigm which is much more zero-sum\u2014much more rent seeking focused. So on this topic of Bitcoin as an American \u2014 in the idea sense \u2014 technology, Saylor had this great quote that, A crucible of virtuous innovation requires a vacuum insulation layer. Again, to preserve the wealth whether that\u2019s the productivity, the energy generated, the profits, the cash flows of any entity requires an insulating layer of some kind! Otherwise the entropy of nature \u2014 whether it\u2019s the greed of man or the uncertainty of nature or the taxes of moving capital from one jurisdiction to another \u2014 they just eat up that wealth itself! So again we\u2019re back to Bitcoin being the ultimate vacuum sealing of capital we\u2019ve ever had! We got into inflation a bit and the one thing I really wanted to point out here is that contrary to what Bitcoin is \u2014 this virtuous feedback loop of incentives and game theory \u2014 fiat currency is actually the reverse! So not only is inflation theft \u2014 it\u2019s eroding real wealth through fiat currency supply inflation, but there\u2019s also a psychological element to it as well! If inflation is growing, market actors are smart! They start to attempt to frontrun future inflation, so actually inflation expectations tend to outpace actual inflation in a nonlinear fashion! So inflation\u2019s coming in at 2, 3, 4, 5%. If it\u2019s growing, people expect it to continue growing and they\u2019ll actually start selling their fiat today in anticipation of further fiat currency inflation in the future. And if you sell fiat currency, you\u2019re inducing further inflationary pressure on it. You\u2019re actually increasing the velocity of money itself. It becomes this game of hot potatoes \u2014 you don\u2019t want to hold the dollars. And this can add fuel to that vicious cycle that ultimately culminates in hyperinflation. Again that\u2019s just the precise opposite of Bitcoin\u2019s quantitative hardening technology \u2014 it\u2019s disinflating over time, causing it to appreciate! And finally we got into one of the topics I like to talk about a lot which I think is eternally mystifying \u2014 is this concept of truth! Saylor presented it in a way I never heard before in that he said, Conservative energy is truth. Meaning that: Whatever strategy or organism or organization best adheres to the first law of thermodynamics and optimizing its inflows and outflows of energy or money or anything else \u2014 that\u2019s how you succeed! You wanna maximize your cash inflows, minimize your cash outflows, for instance, to be a successful organization. In that context Bitcoin is the first conservative monetary network in history! We could say gold was one \u2014 it was the most conservative monetary network in history \u2014 but Bitcoin\u2019s the first one that maps perfectly onto thermodynamics! As Saylor said sort of jokingly how they talked about thermodynamics at MIT in that, You can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t break even, and you can\u2019t escape the game \u2014 Bitcoin maps onto that really well! You can\u2019t manipulate 21 Million, you must incur transaction fees \u2014 so you can\u2019t really break even \u2014 and you can\u2019t ignore the game! You can\u2019t escape the game of Bitcoin! It just imposes its rules on everything! So that was it! I think it was a great episode! He concluded with saying that perhaps Bitcoin is actually the first instance of technology crashing into economics, so possibly it\u2019ll cause a rewriting of history books, which I\u2019ve intuited it would! More so in the sphere of say capitalism versus socialism, but we may actually see economics become more focused on these physical principles of say energy and everything that we discussed today \u2014 thermodynamics and things like that. And actually the new book by Saifedean \u2014 he\u2019s writing a book called Principles of Economics, and it goes into energy! Which is not something that you typically see in economics textbooks, so he might be right at the cutting edge of something really important! That was Episode 5, I hope you can tell things are heating up at this point! We spent a lot of time building this foundation and now I think you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of that. Things are only going to get more interesting in future episodes. Thanks for listening, and we\u2019ll see you soon!"}

Welcome back to Episode 4 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! We\u2019re coming back today with part 4 of the Saylor Series! And this is the first part of Day 2! So Saylor and I spent 2 days recording, we did about 10.5 hours in total, so Episode 4 represents the first episode in Day 2. And if you haven\u2019t seen episodes 1\u20133 yet I highly recommend you go and check those out! We built a lot of foundational material there that just gets referenced back to going forward, so I think it\u2019s really important! In Episodes 1\u20133 we covered the Stone Ages, the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we went forward into the Steel and the Industrial Age. And now, today, we\u2019re getting into the good stuff! Bitcoin theory, the Digital Age, how money and economics is changing once again based on these new and radical innovations in the world today. So today we\u2019re gonna learn about how Bitcoin is the first true digital monetary system in world history! We\u2019re also gonna get Saylor\u2019s answer to that all-important question: What is money? And he has a really good answer I think you\u2019re gonna dig! And we\u2019re gonna get into a bit of the economic principles underlying commodities and their use as money, and why commodities make a really bad form of money, actually. Saylor lays out a really good case for the commodity money kind of being a self-defeating endeavor. And then finally, we\u2019re gonna start looking at Bitcoin as the ultimate means of wealth settlement and preservation. As Saylor refers to it \u2014 it is the first closed loop or closed source energy system we\u2019ve ever had! So I don\u2019t want to spoil anything! This episode\u2019s really good! For me this when a lot of the light bulbs started to go off and started to have a lot of those little, mini epiphanies during our conversation, which you might see me having as we engage. So I hope you like this! It\u2019s a really good episode. See you again soon!"}

We\u2019ve tried others, they just didn\u2019t work! This is the first one that\u2019s perfected, that\u2019s functioning! It\u2019s the first one to cross $100 Billion in market cap and now it\u2019s about $200 Billion in market cap. $200 Billion means $200 Billion of monetary energy, and if I look at all of the great digital networks \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 when they cross $100 Billion of monetary energy, then that\u2019s a legitimizing step! Generally when they get there, 95% or more of the investing community doesn\u2019t believe in them! Sometimes 99% doesn\u2019t believe in them! But they\u2019re too big to fail \u2014 they\u2019re fires that have been unleashed into the society, and they\u2019re burning, and the effect is exothermal. What we have in each of these networks is: we have the collapse, a dematerialization of some product or service or virtue or some ineffable quality be it friendship or mobile devices or information. It\u2019s collapsing into a lower energy state. And as it collapses into a lower energy state, huge amounts of energy in the form of profit, cash flow, and value get given off! Apple can ship a better camera to a billion people overnight for a nickel! Facebook can improve the way that you communicate to your loved ones overnight for a nickel! And Google can package the Library of Alexandria in the palm of your hand and ship it to a billion people overnight for a nickel! And when you have these massive dematerializations of value and they get on a network with a network effect, it\u2019s almost like \u2014 well you see a crystallizing structure where you\u2019ve got an amorphous substance and as it crystallizes we go from steam to water to ice! Collapses, gives off energy. And what Bitcoin is, is it\u2019s that first digital monetary network, digital monetary system. It\u2019s collapsing into a much more efficient form, it\u2019s giving off energy! And that just brings us back to that entire subject of: how important is energy to the human race!"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-4-DyItQhjeWpc/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 4 | Bitcoin: The First Digital Monetary Energy Network", "text": "Robert Breedlove [09:52]: Let me just ask you a question there: there\u2019s a chart with phase transitions of say, water, of going from ice to water to steam as its temperature increases, and it shows increases in temperature, and when it actually goes into the phase transition it flatlines! So it\u2019s like all that energy is being reallocated to I guess changing the molecular structure for the next state. Then the temperature starts to increase again as it goes into water, and then it flatlines again before going into steam. So I guess what you\u2019re getting at is that energy becomes transmuted into the next state before it can start to give off energy in the form of profit, productivity \u2014 it\u2019s giving back economic substance to its users. And I think that\u2019s sort of the analogy you\u2019re drawing there?"}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-4-DyItQhjeWpc/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 4 | Bitcoin: The First Digital Monetary Energy Network", "text": "Michael Saylor [10:44]: Yeah it\u2019s a wild thing when all the monetary energy leaps from gold to Bitcoin! Or when it leaps from fiat to Bitcoin! There\u2019s this phase transition, and we see it throughout all areas of science, but right now this is just the first time in human history that we see this creation of pure digital monetary network! And I want to replace monetary network with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! And money is energy! In fact, money is the highest form of energy! So if we ask the question, What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. So if I look back through time, human beings as a species prosper by channeling energy. And when we mastered fire, we channeled chemical energy. And when we mastered missiles we channel kinetic energy. And when we master water and hydraulics, we\u2019re actually channeling gravitational energy. The idea of an aqueduct is, well, I\u2019m using gravity to move water 70 miles! Or I\u2019m running a water wheel, or I\u2019m floating a 2-ton block in the water and the gravity\u2019s pushing down on the water and the water is pushing up! And when I dam a stream and I generate hydro energy, well that\u2019s gravity being converted into energy. But if I dam the stream to divert a bunch of fish into my pond, I\u2019m still using gravity! Now, I can channel gravity by dumping a bunch of rocks on your head, but it\u2019s not nearly so easy to create a river of rocks as it is to just tap into a river of water! And so the mastery of fire and water is the mastery of chemical energy, gravitational energy, eventually thermal energy, and the modern era morphed into the mastery of electrical energy and atomic energy. And of course there\u2019s conservation of energy, and when we look at all of these energy networks, I mean look \u2014 100 guys with bows and arrows are an energy network! I\u2019m moving kinetic energy from this side of the battlefield to that side of the battlefield! And a civilization at the mouth of a river with cities up and down the river is sitting on an energy network, just like the Aegean, and the Greek civilization was sitting at the middle of an energy network and they were using gravitational energy. And wind energy \u2014 another form of energy between sails and gravity \u2014 I\u2019m taking advantage of these energies! So the theme is: humans prosper by channeling energy. Now, what\u2019s the most efficient energy network in the history of the world? Well it\u2019s about to be Bitcoin! Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain? And by domain I mean perhaps governmental domain \u2014 like how do I move my energy from New York to Tokyo? And this becomes an interesting question! Let\u2019s take a typical power grid: well I generate power, I channel chemical energy into electrical energy, I lose like 35% of the energy in the coal or in the fossil fuel. When it gets onto the grid, I move it over a high voltage line, and I can move it up to about 500 miles and I lose 2% of the energy. Now it has to get stepped down to 240 volts or lower voltage even, to get into your house. As the voltage steps down, I lose more energy \u2014 it\u2019s about a 4% loss. If I had pure energy at the power plant, I\u2019m gonna lose 6% of the energy to put it into your house 250 miles away! I can\u2019t send 2,000 miles away \u2014 I just can\u2019t I can\u2019t send it 10,000 miles away \u2014 energy will not move from New York to Tokyo. But I can New York to Schenectady! Now when it gets into your house, you have to use it immediately! You can\u2019t store it! So let\u2019s say I wanted to store it \u2014 I need a battery! Well the absence of a battery prevents a mechanism. The mobile wave is a function of Lithium ion batteries in the palm of your hand \u2014 no Lithium ion battery, no smart phone! Now we\u2019re working with modern batteries. Tesla: it\u2019s all about the battery, right? And Elon Musk has really driven battery technology! So let\u2019s say I put a battery in your house. And you pull energy into your house. Well you\u2019ve lose 6%! Now a typical battery \u2014 a good one \u2014 is gonna lose 2% per month! Okay, that means you\u2019re gonna lose 24% of your energy a year! Well what does that sound like? It sounds like 24% inflation a year! It sounds like hyperinflation \u2014 it could get worse, right? Hyperinflation is 100% inflation a year! Let\u2019s say that I have a battery which loses 20% of my power a year, well my half-life on my energy that I pulled off the plant is 3.5 years in 10 years! I\u2019m down to 12.5% of my energy! So the entire civilization is based upon electric power grids and networks, and yet it\u2019s not that good! I mean you really can\u2019t store that much power! Anybody that ever put their computer, they charged it and left the computer for a month or 2 months and you whipped it open, it\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s drained!"}

So if they don\u2019t use it today, it starts to bleed out. And so this is the loss on the network."}

And I think this is important too to tie this back to money, is that gold itself \u2014 to your point \u2014 was an energy network! Whatever productivity couldn\u2019t be allocated towards something more economic, we would go and mine gold, such that gold became this claim on savings of humanity\u2014which is what money is. And those savings themselves are the result of all our collective energy utilization up until that point. We\u2019ve been transitioning energy into capital, and then gold, or money, becomes the network that commands that capital, and then what I think is interesting too is that the scarcity of the gold actually reflects the scarcity of the energy. So it maps onto it in a way."}
{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-4-DyItQhjeWpc/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 4 | Bitcoin: The First Digital Monetary Energy Network", "text": "Michael Saylor [18:44]: A brilliant insight! And now let\u2019s play a thought experiment: let\u2019s take our $100 Million worth of monetary energy and let\u2019s put it in a power network that runs on copper, and then let\u2019s put it into a gold network! If I put it into a copper energy network, I have 24% bleed rate per year by the time it gets to the battery. I lose 6%, and I can\u2019t get it more than 500 miles. Okay, so it\u2019s a very short term, short duration, here and now energy network. Let\u2019s put it into a gold network: I put $100 Million into gold. Now I can move that $100 Million of gold 100 miles \u2014 would I lose 6%? Probably not 6%! I could probably move $100 Million of gold 100 miles for $10,000-$100,000 depending on how much security I need! So we\u2019re talking about 10 basis points, instead of 600 basis points of loss. 10 basis points! So gold is a more efficient way to move large amounts of energy for short distances. What if I want to move $100 Million of gold 10,000 miles? Well, that\u2019s about 3,000 lbs of gold, 1.5 tons. So I put it on a global express, it costs $10,000 an hour, I put some dudes with guns on it, I fly 16\u201318 hours around the world \u2014 that\u2019s about $180,000 plus another $70,000. $250,000. If I have to fly the plane back \u2014 let\u2019s just assume I don\u2019t! It\u2019s $250,000, so now we\u2019re up to like 25 basis points. 0.25% is the cost to move it around the world once! Okay? So that\u2019s okay. Now what if I want to deliver $100 Million of gold 100 years into the future? What if I wanted to deliver $100 Million of energy 100 years into the future on copper and batteries? Well my half-life is at 24% at 2% bleed a month. My half-life is 3.5 years. It\u2019s gone completely! And everybody with any common sense knows if you put your laptop charged in your attic for 100 years, it will not be charged in 100 years! You cannot store electricity on a copper network or a Lithium ion battery, it\u2019s no good! I put it in gold, put it in a vault. So let\u2019s say I put it in a vault in J.P. Morgan in 1900 in the United States of America. And the United States is the most successful country in the 20th century: we win every war, and J.P. Morgan remains as a bank and the vault in New York remains. In that case, assuming a 2% mining rate, assuming a stock to flow of 50 and miners mine 2% more gold a year, the half-life of a gold battery is 35 years. I go from $100 Million to $50 Million in 35 years, to $25 Million in 70 years. So about $12.5 Million in 100 years! So I\u2019ve depleted my gold battery 87% if the United States wins every war, and if J.P. Morgan isn\u2019t a corrupt institution and doesn\u2019t fail, and if no one drops a nuclear bomb on New York City! If those things don\u2019t happen then I will get 12% of my money back!"}

We have a gold network and we want to move money, so I put $100 Million in gold and I want to move it around \u2014 well it\u2019s 25 basis points every time I want to move it around. If I want to move it once a quarter, it\u2019s 1% bleed a year if I move it once a quarter. If I mine it it\u2019s 2% bleed a year. That gets me to 3% bleed a year. Divide that into 70 and every 22 years \u2014 that\u2019s the half-life of gold. Energy on a gold network has a half-life of 22 years at best! When you throw in the counterparty risk and the need to move it around \u2014 let\u2019s just assume that we move it around so you don\u2019t lose it! You\u2019re just down to now the issue of technology and commodity risk. And this is an important point: gold is the king of commodities! Gold is the greatest of all human commodities! But my first job at DuPont was I built computer simulations of commodities and specialty chemical networks, and let me tell you what people in that business think: they think commodity is a dirty word! The first thing I learned is: commodity is awful! Nobody wants to be in a commodity business! And here\u2019s the reason commodities are awful: if I actually create a factory that creates a commodity, say, gasoline \u2014 the only thing it can do is create gasoline! If I invest $10 Billion into gasoline refinery, my fixed cost are $10 Billion. The ideal, rational price for me to make a profit? Probably at $4 a gallon? But my variable cost is $1.50 a gallon, because I\u2019ve got all these billions of dollars in the factory! What happens is, when I create commodity refineries, when the price below the profitable point, I will still keep running the factory, because I\u2019ve got a variable margin. I\u2019m generating cash flow even though I\u2019m driving the price down for everybody else in the business. So it\u2019s possible in the commodity business for every single producer to be losing money! And for them to all be acting irrationally, and they\u2019re all pumping out the commodity be it silver \u2014 if you\u2019re a gold miner, what can you do other than mine gold? Once I\u2019ve gone and I\u2019ve invested $100 Billion in mining gold, if the price of gold is cut in half, but my variable cost is $400 an ounce and it\u2019s $800 an ounce, I\u2019m mining gold and selling it at $800 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $700 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $600! When it gets to $500, I\u2019m selling it because the market is not rational \u2014 I can\u2019t transmute my $100 Billion of gold mining capital into Google stock!"}

Maybe a certain government wants to mine gold! Maybe I can\u2019t legally stop even if I wanted to stop! So when you have a commodity business where people have specialized capital and they make those investments, what happens over time everywhere in every industry in every commodity in the history of the world is: the producers overproduce the commodity because, in the phrase of Hotel California, You can check in anytime you want, but you can\u2019t ever leave! It\u2019s a one-way route! You go in, you can\u2019t get out! So that takes us to this real issue of gold, or the real risk of gold, which is: gold prices goes up by a factor of 10, capital gets attracted into commodity production. It\u2019s a feedback: people produce more, gold price goes down, people keep producing to try to recover their cash flows, lots of intelligent people become desperate. When men are desperate, they invent new techniques to produce more gold. They keep producing because they don\u2019t have a choice! They will produce down until the variable cost equals the price, then they will keep producing below variable cost, because it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re in a situation where they can lay off \u2014 for example: a government that takes ownership of a gold mine will produce below variable cost in order to maintain jobs."}

If you\u2019re Singapore and you turn off the airlines because they\u2019re not profitable, you turned off your bridge to the world! The politicians will run the airline below variable cost. If I want to keep jobs \u2014 and how many countries want to project jobs \u2014 if I want to project jobs, I will produce something and sell it below the variable cost. We do that with anything that is politically charged! When a government decides: education, healthcare, transportation, automobiles, local manufacturing, security, defense \u2014 defense is a great example of something that we produce whether we like it or not at a cost that\u2019s higher than potentially the value and use of it!

So in that way it\u2019s kind of like the smartest form of energy, because human beings \u2014 our ingenuity, our time, our ability to see the world \u2014 we are the greatest form of economic energy in the world, and gold is the instrument that commands that energy!"}

It takes us back to why Marjorie Merriweather Post was the richest woman in the world! Because Post cereal was starch was stable in a box for a year! Stability at room temperature! Like, Coca-Cola is stable at room temperature in a can. And gold is stable energy! So yeah it\u2019s energy but nonetheless it\u2019s a commodity, and you know what they call a business when it\u2019s been totally wrecked? They call it commoditized! [inaudible] And so every businessperson forever has always strived to avoid being commoditized! That\u2019s the origin of branding, right? We branded sugar water, we branded Gucci bags, we branded everything. We patent things, we brand things, because we want to avoid the inevitable result! The result is: as soon as something is commoditized and open to the public and anybody can produce it, its value goes to the variable cost of production and then it goes below! For example, Apple Computer \u2014 worth $2 Trillion today \u2014 Google, worth more than a Trillion, Facebook. These are valuable networks! But are they the most valuable networks? No! They\u2019re not the most valuable networks to humanity \u2014 they\u2019re the most valuable non-commoditized networks! Because if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on Google, it\u2019s inconvenient. But if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on the power company, it\u2019s deadly! If I cut off your power and your water or even turn off the bridge \u2014 people die! If I turn off Google, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 nobody in New York City\u2019s going to die, right? And so people forget this! And this is the danger of putting all your wealth, of storing your wealth in Apple stock! The world thinks Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 Big Tech \u2014 they\u2019re a store of value! And post-pandemic, everybody surged into the NASDAQ five, and the NASDAQ, because of Big Tech equity \u2014 this is a store of value! I\u2019ll be safe here! We\u2019ll you\u2019ll be safe there for a year, or two years, but you know, General Electric and General Motors and Standard Oil were once, they were the most important networks on Earth, and they changed humanity a lot more than Google, Apple, and Facebook did! And you want to change your life? Try to go a week without electricity and see if there aren\u2019t riots, murders, mayhem! So people don\u2019t ask the question, Why is it that I get my electricity for nothing? Why do I get my water for nothing? Because you try to go 3 days without water, 3 days without electricity, you see what that\u2019s like! And the answer is: because those two things got declared as public utilities \u2014 that they\u2019re so important that nobody have a monopoly on it! As soon as Standard Oil became so instrumental that it changed the Western world, politicians got interested in Standard Oil! And if your power company said, We just decided to jack the cost of electricity by a factor of 10. Would you pay it? Sure you\u2019d pay it, right? Would you complain? Who would you complain to? A politician, right? So we\u2019ve got these networks, they\u2019re really important! But eventually if they\u2019re important enough, they become commodity networks. And so that\u2019s an interesting characteristic. The reason that gold doesn\u2019t work over time is \u2014 we have two examples. It doesn\u2019t work over time because people produce 2\u20133% more of it every year, and over 100 years that means you lose 90% of your energy. It doesn\u2019t work over time because there\u2019s counterparty risks, and the Polish bank, through no fault of their own, got overrun by the Nazis in World War II, and Beijing bank got overrun by first one regime then another regime then a third regime! So that\u2019s another reason it doesn\u2019t work! And a third reason it doesn\u2019t work is if the people become threatened by the network \u2014 so for example 1933, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt found gold to be inconvenient \u2014 if the people become threatened, they complain to the politicians. The politicians might go ahead and take action, and in this case, the reason they were able to take action is because all the gold was sitting in the same place! So if the gold\u2019s sitting in a vault and we know where it is, and it\u2019s under the control of institutions, the institutions are under control of government and therefore that heightens the counterparty risk because of the centralized nature of gold. So the best case for a gold network is you\u2019re gonna lose 90% of your energy over 100 years! But the likely case is you\u2019re gonna lose 95%-98% of your energy over 100 years. And if we look at Nicholas Taleb\u2019s range of outcomes, if you take the 100 biggest cities in the world and you put your gold in the best bank in any of the hundred cities in the world, it looks like in 95\u201396 of them or maybe 99 of them, you lost all your money! You lost all your gold!"}

Because it is so heavy and hard to transact \u2014 compared to Bitcoin, that\u2019s non-corporeal, it can be transmitted at the speed of light \u2014 because gold is so heavy to settle, that that leads to its centralization in bank vaults, and that becomes the ultimate honey pot for politicians and governments, frankly! And the other attack vector we didn\u2019t discuss is that temptation is always given into! As soon as things get dicey, governments immediately monopolize that gold energy network, which is the most important in the world!"}

Every good technology is smarter, faster, stronger! Every technology! Smarter, faster, stronger! So coming to digital gold versus gold: physical gold is not fast enough! How fast is it? If I wanted to move $100 Million of gold, as we talked about, it\u2019s gonna cost me $250,000. So that\u2019s an impedance! But how long is that gonna take you? A week? A month? Somewhere between \u2014 you wanna move 3,000 lbs of gold from New York? I\u2019ve got a month I\u2019m guessing, if you want to get all the protocols set up. So you\u2019re talking about a quarter-million dollars and a month to move the gold. Assuming I needed another custodian and I used Bitcoin, and I wanted to move $100 Million to Bitcoin \u2014 and this is where Bitcoin critics are just utterly wrong and missing the point! \u2014 they all think, Oh, well it takes 30 minutes and $5 to move Bitcoin! And they\u2019re comparing it to a new crypto network that has no value on it! And they\u2019re saying, I can find a way to move it in 5 minutes for a nickel \u2014 but that\u2019s not the point! The appropriate comparison is to gold! How long would it take to move $100 Million of gold? Because there\u2019s $250 Trillion in assets in the alt-assets! And there\u2019s only $25 Billion of real assets in the altcoins or the alt-cryptos. So how long does it take me to move the $250 Trillion around? And when you think about that you realize that Bitcoin would move it in 30 minutes instead of 30 days. Okay? That\u2019s 1,440x as fast! A thousand times as fast a minute versus 1,440 minutes in a day. And so it\u2019s a thousand times as fast, but then it\u2019s $5 versus $250,000! So that\u2019s 50,000x cheaper! So now we\u2019ve got people saying, Oh well it\u2019s very energy efficient \u2014 blah blah blah! Well it\u2019s not, really! It\u2019s inefficient in the way that it\u2019s inefficient to create an electro high speed transit system, a mass-transit system. It was expensive to build the mass-transit system, it got really really cheap to move onto the rails! If you look at the history of railroads, the biggest thing in the 19th century was railroads. It was pretty expensive to create the railroads! It became really cheap to move on the rails! So what we do is we\u2019ve created crypto rails in order to make it 50,000x cheaper to move! But it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s 50,000x cheaper, it\u2019s that it\u2019s 1,000x faster and 50,000x cheaper, and then when you start to multiply 1,000 x 50,000, and you realize \u2014 it starts to be 50,000,000x faster, and then you start to add that third dimension, which is maybe a computer that thinks about this while you\u2019re sleeping 18,000 times, and you realize eventually you get to 50,000,000,000x faster! And now we\u2019ve got to a new engineering or new scientific metaphor which is: superconducting networks! There\u2019s impedance going through an electric power network and you\u2019re losing it, so the solution is that I need to get this superconducted! So I gotta cool the network down to close to near-zero, and it\u2019s expensive! And the point is: Yeah! It\u2019s expensive to get to near-zero, and then the impedance disappears in the network and the friction goes away! And what could you do if the friction went completely away?"}

And that\u2019s the breakthrough that people don\u2019t get, it\u2019s like, What can I do if I had vacuum, and I was rid of friction? And yeah there\u2019s a price to pay!

Now get into outer space and take your flashlight and shine it, or flip it the other way: the Hubble telescope!

It\u2019s something that\u2019s just altogether unique and we\u2019ve just never had it before! If you now conceptualize that and you go through your thought experiment, you realize: we need a monetary system, and our monetary system\u2014the three in front of our face are, let\u2019s take it\u2014fiat is a monetary system, gold is a monetary system, Bitcoin is a monetary system. If I put my $100 Million of monetary energy \u2014 I have energy. I take energy, I sell it on the grid, you give me money! I take my money, I put it into the US dollar bank \u2014 it\u2019s in fiat. I wait 100 years, and it\u2019s 7\u20138% asset inflation rate, I have a half-life of 10 years, so I get cut in half 10 times! Okay? $100 Million\u2026$50 Million\u2026$25 Million\u2026$12 Million \u2014 it\u2019s gonna get painful!\u2026$6 Million\u2026$3 Million\u2026I only cut in half 5 times!\u2026$1.5 Million\u2026that\u2019s 6 times, now it gets really painful!\u202670 basis points\u202635 basis points\u202617 basis points\u20268 basis points! By the way, 8 basis points if you don\u2019t get hyperinflation! 8 basis points if your nation wins every war! So we\u2019re not even \u2014 what to say is: you\u2019re losing 99% of your energy. 99% of your energy is being charitable! Now let\u2019s generate $100 Million worth of electricity by burning coal or nuclear power or peddling on my flywheel or rowing on my row machine \u2014 however you got to it \u2014 windmills! Let\u2019s sell it to the grid, take the $100 Million, and let\u2019s to go J.P. Morgan and let\u2019s buy $100 Million worth of gold and let\u2019s have them custodian for me. Put it in their vault \u2014 I guess I could just take it with me, it\u2019s 3,000 lbs! It\u2019s $2,000 an ounce, or whatever the number is! Okay so 1.5 tons \u2014 no! I gotta put it in a vault, right? So I put it in a vault and I pay for custody fees and going in there\u2019s a fee, and then I\u2019m paying, whatever, 20, 30, 40 basis points a year to keep it, and then the miners are out there doing their mining thing and it\u2019s probably 200 basis points worth of additional gold. So that\u2019s 250 basis points a year. And if I watch it and assuming it\u2019s just a dead rock and it\u2019s heavy, I\u2019m not moving it \u2014 I\u2019m doing nothing with it, I\u2019m just staring at it \u2014 then I\u2019ve just gotta add on the counterparty risk and then the fracking risk, or the technology risk. The fracking risk is \u2014 academics always opine about shortages. Academics have been saying there\u2019s an oil shortage, and energy shortage coming! They\u2019ve been saying it since the Club of Rome in 1973 or something! They said it in the \u201950s, \u201960s, \u201970s, \u201980s, and \u201990s, and the world always predicted that we were gonna run out of oil or energy in about 10 years. I studied this at MIT \u2014 I created computer simulations about it. There\u2019s an entire school of thought \u2014 system dynamics \u2014 that studies these things. And the flaw in the reasoning is: it\u2019s a linear interpretation of the world instead of a closed feedback or a non-linear interpretation of the world. The linear interpretation of the world is: we\u2019ve got 10 years worth of oil because that\u2019s what our main proven reserves are! The closed loop interpretation of the world is: when we actually get to 5 years worth of reserves, people start looking for more reserves! And so, no company wants to carry on their balance sheet more than about 10 years worth. And then they just keep finding more, but they don\u2019t publish it. We\u2019re not factoring in human will to live, human ingenuity! People have a tendency that when you tell them they\u2019re about to run out of something, they reprioritize, they think a little bit harder, and they come up with an innovative solution! So that\u2019s what happened with fracking. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil, we had a crisis, and eventually the price of oil went high enough. The people sat down and said, You know? If we invent a new chemistry, and if we raised some capital, we can go ahead and implement fracking, and we doubled the amount of oil! And we did it fast! We had 5 Million barrels a day for like 40 years and that was conventional wisdom and everybody thought, That\u2019s it! And then we went the next year to 6 Million, the next year to 7 Million, the next year to 8 Million, the next year to 9 Million, the next year to 10 Million! And I watched it happen, and I watched all of the big investment bankers \u2014 J.P. Morgan and the like \u2014 they went and they raised billions of dollars from investors and they invested in these fracking companies, in Chesapeake Energy and all these others popped up, and we were awash with oil! And the next thing you read is that we have too much oil! Because it\u2019s a commodity! Because if you put $100 Billion into anything, you invent something new! So for you to be a \u2014 this is why being a cynic and being a pessimist about technology is generally a losing trade, because you\u2019re assuming that human beings won\u2019t invent anything new and have no capability to do it different!"}

And if you study the history of science, the history of science is very simple: the non-scientist and non-believers that will tell you why it\u2019s impossible, and then the creative, innovative scientist who thought, I\u2019m gonna ignore that\u2014and just go try it. And 99% of the population generally will just tell you why it\u2019s impossible and be cynical and be critical and they\u2019re fearful. And the 1% will say, I think I\u2019ll just go try it! And of course the 1% is generally right! I mean, they\u2019re wrong until they\u2019re right! The technology fails until it succeeds. But if they just keep trying, the likelihood that you\u2019ll invent electricity or airplanes or antibiotics or better techniques for agriculture or mobile phones or YouTube\u2014the likelihood is high! It is highly likely that someone in the future will come up with a way to extract all the energy that you\u2019re ever gonna need from some element the size of a sugar cube. We don\u2019t have it yet, and I can probably find a million conventional thinkers that\u2019ll tell us why it\u2019s impossible. The same guys that told John Harrison he couldn\u2019t discover longitude with a clock, and the same guys that told the Wright brothers they couldn\u2019t fly! It would be those same guys\u2014and they\u2019ll be right until they\u2019re wrong! And in this particular case, that\u2019s a good thing! That\u2019s a good thing if what you want is abundance. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s a crippling intellectual mistake to run a monetary standard on a commodity that can be produced by man! Ultimately, you have to run a monetary system on math, right? As you pointed out before \u2014 mathematical money \u2014 because 2 + 2 = 4, and as long as 2 + 2 = 4, human ingenuity is not the enemy! And this is a basic sociological principle, really, which is: do you want to design a system assuming that people are stupid and will not evolve and cannot defeat it? Or do you want to design a system assuming people are smart and channel the energy of human ingenuity into making the system work better? And this is why gold is defective! And why a decentralized crypto network of which Bitcoin is the most successful in the history of the world \u2014 that\u2019s why it is effective, because Bitcoin is channeling human ingenuity into making it better! And every commodity is channeling human ingenuity into making it worse, as a money! So if we come back to this idea, Bitcoin is the ultimate energy network! Well we\u2019re gonna bleed 99.5% of our energy on a fiat network. We\u2019re going to bleed 95% or more of our energy on a gold network. Once you calculate the fully diluted Bitcoin count \u2014 21,999,999.98, as I heard from Andreas the other day, that number just slightly less than 21 Million \u2014 once you\u2019ve done that, then you just realize that it\u2019s a lossless monetary energy system through time. Through space, it has a slight loss in the form of transaction fees, but it\u2019s a good thing, and the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are like a little bit of impedance and/or a little bit of gravity, a little bit of friction. And the goddess of wisdom that created the universe gave us a little bit of friction \u2014 it\u2019s a good thing! No gravity, no friction \u2014 your life gets really really complicated!"}

That\u2019s why the idea that I\u2019ve gotta drive transaction fees to zero is a silly idea! It\u2019s like, No! What we want to do is drive inflation or the loss of energy over time to zero, and then we want there to be a slight loss of energy when we reorganize all of the monetary energy. When I send $100 Million from New York to Tokyo, I don\u2019t mind spending $5. I probably won\u2019t mind spending $50! When Bitcoin has $250 Trillion of energy into it, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t pay $25 Billion in transaction fees! People forget \u2014 again \u2014 this is the problem of the crypto community: they\u2019re fixated upon a prototypical coin network that\u2019s a lab experiment, and they\u2019re comparing it to Bitcoin, instead of comparing Bitcoin to actual monetary or asset networks in the real world! So for example here\u2019s a real asset network: it\u2019s called real estate! I have $100 Trillion of real estate. You have a house. Let\u2019s say you have a $1 Million house. You wanna hold \u2014 this is a good example \u2014 let\u2019s assume that real estate is my energy network! If you wanna actually carry a $1 Million house 100 years \u2014 in Florida, there\u2019s a 2% real estate tax. You would pay $20,000 a year every year for 100 years, assuming that the house was capped and not reappraised, and so you\u2019re in essence going to lose the house in 50 years! Right? Under the best of circumstances! You\u2019re gonna lose all your wealth in about 20 years if you store your wealth or your monetary energy in a real estate network in Florida. So if you go to any other real estate jurisdiction, they\u2019ve all got different tax rates over time, but this is why you can\u2019t really store energy in property, because the tax rate generally will bleed you out in somewhere between 20-100 years. Now that\u2019s the inflation rate, or the energy loss rate over time. What about over space? What if you wanted to transfer a $100 Million house? What if I want to buy it from you? So you want to exchange \u2014 heat exchange, energy exchange \u2014 you want to exchange the energy in the house? Well it\u2019s a 6% transaction fee, and at the point that I said, Robert I want to buy your house, I\u2019ll give you $1 Million bucks for it. How many days \u2018till closing? 30? Probably 30! Okay, so you just paid $60,000 and waited a month in order to do your transaction! Now compare that to Bitcoin again? 30 minutes? $6 bucks? 30 days, $60,000! This is why we don\u2019t use property as an energy network! By the way, some people do! You can ask people point blank, How are you gonna actually give your money to your granddaughter? Well I\u2019m gonna buy property. But it where? California? Florida? Where? It\u2019s the same counterparty risk! It\u2019s worse than gold! You can move 3,000 lbs of gold in 30 days for $150,000-$200,000! You can\u2019t move $100 Million worth of property in 30 days to another country!"}

It\u2019ll take you 30 days to do the transaction. Now we just come back to this fee, right? What are the transaction fees on the Visa network? What are the transaction fees across any monetary network? It\u2019s pretty routine to pay 1%, 2%, 3% to move something around. If Bitcoin gets to be $100 Trillion and there\u2019s 1% transaction fees, it\u2019s going to be \u2014 well pick any number and multiply it by 1%! It\u2019s $1 Trillion a year in transaction fees! Nothing wrong with that! What\u2019s the entire size of the \u2014 you know what the spreads are in the bond industry? Like, I used to buy and sell convertible debt. There were 200 basis point spreads. You could buy at 0.98%, you could sell at 0.96% \u2014 the banks got in between! So all of the financial system is built on taking a spread. That\u2019s why New York City has tall buildings! We\u2019ve talked about this before. Wherever there\u2019s a node in a network \u2014 a rail head, Venice, Paris, London, New York \u2014 wherever there\u2019s a node in a central network where there\u2019s exchange, there\u2019s a transaction fee. And if you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s only 1% or 2%! When you\u2019re unlucky \u2014 I mean there\u2019s a reason people refer to free ports. Free port meant that when you pull your ship into our port we weren\u2019t gonna steal it all! You know what the great breakthrough is in Singapore? Here\u2019s the breakthrough: we\u2019re gonna have a port in the middle of the Pacific where when the ship comes into our port, we don\u2019t take all of their cargo! Or we don\u2019t take 10% of their cargo! That\u2019s your idea? Yeah! That\u2019s my idea! We\u2019re gonna let them stop here and not seize 10% of their stuff! Wow! That\u2019s a brilliant idea! By the way, that\u2019s such a unique concept that Singapore is Singapore! It is the greatest port in the Pacific \u2014 because it\u2019s so rare that a country agrees not to take 3% of what you have when you stop! You can\u2019t even come into the United States without filling out a customs form where they charge you a 10% duty on whatever you have in your possession! The point is: it\u2019s very common to take 10% of what you have when you come and when you leave. That\u2019s why those cities are cities! That\u2019s why those empires are empires! So when someone sits around and they whine about $5 in transaction fees is too great, they\u2019re whining because it\u2019s more expensive than their laboratory experiment on their scientific workbench that no one\u2019s using! Yeah, I can conceptualize hypothetically in my perfect world a perfect system where it was better. But the real world is $100 Trillion worth of real estate and $250 Trillion worth of bonds and stocks and gold and silver and other property! And that stuff\u2019s moving around with transaction fees which are high enough to have paid for all the buildings in London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Venice, and Rome! It\u2019s not a new idea to charge transaction fees! It\u2019s not a problem! And the beauty of Bitcoin is, as more miners come on, they create a very competitive industry, and if a miner charges too much transaction fees, someone else is gonna drive the cost of transaction fees down, and if the revenue from transaction fees falls below the variable cost of running the mining rigs, people are gonna take mining rigs out of production eventually \u2014 unless a government wants to subsidize them! Unless a government\u2019s gonna be subsidizing the crypto rails which create the 21st economy, and that\u2019s a reason why mining is a bit riskier as a business than owning Bitcoin! Because you\u2019re getting into a commodity business where you may get driven down to the variable cost of the electricity, or below the variable cost of the electricity if someone else wants to get into the business and they can. It\u2019s good for Bitcoin, it\u2019s good for everything built above the chain! Caveat emptor if you wanna get into the commodity \u2014 or the business of encrypted energy!"}

I think that\u2019s a great point too that you bring up the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are set at fair market value. It is a freely competitive industry such that all of the transaction fees are a consensual exchange, and the value paid in those transaction fees goes \u2014 with very little loss \u2014 directly to supporting the security of the network! Whereas ostensibly these government fees\u2014they\u2019re non-consensual, they\u2019re conducted under a monopolized area. A lot of that value being extracted \u2014 10% in, 10% out \u2014 is not going to securing the property rights that you\u2019re bringing in and out! It\u2019s a very small piece of that!

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-4-DyItQhjeWpc/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 4 | Bitcoin: The First Digital Monetary Energy Network", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:11:04]: Alright guys! How good was that? Another great episode with Mr. Saylor! I think we\u2019re starting to see things coming together in this episode where all of this foundation we\u2019ve been laying starts to relate and highlight the significance of Bitcoin in the modern age. We started out talking about Bitcoin being the first true digital monetary network in history. There had been prior attempts with things like E-Gold and other things, but they had never solved the issue of counterparties, frankly! We\u2019ve never had a trust-minimized digital money that was basically more or less free of counterparty risk! And Saylor brings up the great point that Bitcoin \u2014 at the time that we recorded was well over $200 Billion market cap \u2014 and when you look at Bitcoin through that lens as a digital energy network, other digital energy networks like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc., one they pass that $100 Billion milestone, it tends to be kind of a point of no return! And also a point that leads them to realizing these winner-take-all dynamics in digital competition. And he also makes a great point that, at that point in those companies\u2019 life cycles, those digital energy networks\u2019 life cycles, 99% of the investment community still doesn\u2019t get it! When Amazon or Apple is at $100 Billion market cap, people were still just writing them off and didn\u2019t realize that these were gonna be even multi-trillion dollar companies today! So I thought that was really interesting that Bitcoin is really at that juncture where it\u2019s crossed the multi-hundred billion dollar market cap threshold, and that gives it a lot of resiliency to disruption or downside potential, where it still has just a ton of upside potential if you look at it even in the context of gold\u2019s market cap, or other stores of value. And I liked that Saylor went to how these digital networks, they\u2019re dematerializing some ineffable quality. Like social media is friendship, or with Apple you could say maybe it\u2019s information or communication, and with Bitcoin it\u2019s money. And it\u2019s taking that ineffable quality to a lower energy state, something that\u2019s more crystalline-like, and when it does that \u2014 using the analogy of a phase transition \u2014 let\u2019s say water going from liquid to ice, all of this thermal energy is released! And in an economic sense that would be value or cash flows or market cap. What I think he called was an exothermal reaction, where is actually collapses to a state that requires lower energy to remain cohesive, and gives off that excess energy in the form of value of some kind. I thought that was a brilliant way to look at it! And it calls to mind again standardization, right? When we achieve certain standards and everyone starts singing off the same song sheet, productivity just explodes! So our effort necessary to maintain the network collapses, so the network gains a lot of density, and then in doing that it just throws off all of this \u2014 whatever the ineffable quality is that it\u2019s aiming for, whether it\u2019s energy or value or productivity for instance. And then Saylor was so kind to actually answer the question that we always ask on this show, which is, What is money? And the way he puts it is that, Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. And indeed if you go back to what we talked about in Episode 1 to those Stone Age technologies, that\u2019s what human beings have been doing to advance themselves. That is what distinguishes man from animal in fact, is that we harness energy and channel it across the field lines of our intellect, essentially. The three Stone Age technologies we looked at were: fire, missiles, and water. Fire was harnessing and channeling chemical energy, missiles were kinetic energy, and water was gravitational energy! And in the modern era, we\u2019ve evolved past that and now we\u2019re dealing with things like thermal energy, electrical energy, and nuclear energy! And the point that he makes is that, All of the meta-energy, if you will, that controls all of the others is money! Money is the claim on the collective savings of humanity. It\u2019s a claim on the efforts present, past, or future of all of us! So any group that commands one of these forms of energy can be commanded themselves by money. So it makes money this form of meta-energy, which I thought was a very interesting definition! [1:16:27] And it\u2019s also what defines civilization in a way. It\u2019s like, What types of energy are we harnessing? Are we a Stone Age civilization that\u2019s only harnessing fire? And at what scale are we doing that? At what scale are we channeling that energy? Those two aspects are kind of what defines civilization in a lot of ways! And he makes the point too that the challenge has always been moving the energy across domain, and this domain can either be a jurisdictional or governmental domain \u2014 how do you get your capital out of one country into another with the least loss possible, it could be characterological \u2014 so if I\u2019m going from thermal energy to kinetic energy, what\u2019s the most efficient way to do that? We could look at something like the steam engine was such a breakthrough because it allowed us to transition energy the most lossless way. Or even just moving the energy across space and time! If we can harness it and store it in a medium that\u2019s reliable and then transport it somewhere else and redeem it at later times for later uses, that has a lot of value as well! As humans try to go into the world and solve problems. So in that lens, historically at least, gold was energy money! It\u2019s what captured the residual energy that mankind was able to produce, that was not able to be put to a higher and better use. So if we couldn\u2019t dedicate our efforts towards any other activity that could increase productivity more than say gold mining, then we would just go and mine gold! And gold, again being this hard energy money, would sort of be \u2014 it\u2019s annual appreciation would be a proxy for the aggregate productivity growth in an economy. And unless your investment could outperform that, say it\u2019s 2-3% a year, then you would just mine gold! So it kind of provided this floor for human energy, and it was a medium through which we stored and transported it. But, I love this part where Saylor went into the math behind why gold sucks! Even though it was the best thing we ever had historically, it still sucks as an energy money! One was, If you want to move gold around the world once, say it costs you 25 basis points, which on $100 Million is $250,000 just to move it around the world once! So if you\u2019re doing that once a quarter that\u2019s 1% energy loss per year. And then something \u2014 which we got into \u2014 you would almost have to do, because if you\u2019re gonna store gold, you\u2019ve gotta put it in a vault. It\u2019s gotta be physically safeguarded over a long period of time, and you have to trust a counterparty. You have to trust a custodian! And as we went through history, many of these custodians and nation states have fallen over, so if you wanted to transport wealth across 100 years, you would necessarily need to change locations rather frequently just to avoid and minimize that risk! So that was across space, say it costs 1% a year to move it 4\u20135 times a year across space. And then also, gold production increases by about 2% a year, so gold\u2019s got a 2% dilution built right into it from gold mining. So if you put those two together, call it 3% loss per year on this monetary energy batter \u2014 you\u2019ve got a 22-year half-life! In 22 years, holding your value in gold, you\u2019re gonna get cut in half! So that\u2019s just not that great as far as building something with a long time horizon! After 100 years, you\u2019re talking about 87% loss in value if you\u2019re storing in gold! And that\u2019s your best case! That\u2019s assuming that you move it to the right places and you don\u2019t end up storing it in a Frankfurt or Tokyo in 1900 or any of these other cities that lost a war or their institutions were compromised. This assumes that you make the right moves with it! Your best case is let\u2019s say a 90% loss in value. Your worst case is 100% because of confiscation outright, or theft. If you\u2019re Poland and Germany invaded your country your gold was stolen! And Bitcoin is just fundamentally different because it\u2019s this form of money that\u2019s digitized energy! So it\u2019s not stored in a physical corporeal form that can be seen, targeted, confiscated. It\u2019s informational, which allows you a lot of unique ways to custody it in these ultra-high security schemas that are largely resistant to these forms of counterparty risk that we\u2019ve seen gold succumb to in the past. And then we got into commodities, the economic principles surrounding them. [1:21:54] And I liked how he described gold mining in that the cap-ex deployed into gold mining is really largely for the purpose of mining gold, and the switching costs related to it are very high, so you can\u2019t just turn your gold miner off and start mining silver, right? In some cases, depending on the actual piece of equipment, it only may be useful for mining gold. But assuming it\u2019s useful for mining something else, you have to pull it out of the mine, put it on a truck or a ship, ship it somewhere else, redeploy it, not to mention all the training and security involved with that! So very high switching cost on the cap-ex related to gold mining, and this leads to specialized producers overproducing! So they\u2019ll overproduce this commodity \u2014 gold \u2014 down to the point where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, so there\u2019s no profit. And even below at times. Again they\u2019re trying to amortize the cost of this cap-ex that invested in gold mining. Or, it could also possibly \u2014 if they get desperate enough \u2014 they could also seek a government subsidy that can allow them to mine below the cost of capital even further! And so all of this leads to commodity money getting destroyed! The incentives are to always increase its supply and always compress its margins. The way Saylor puts this is that the energy being channeled into commodity production, it\u2019s actually \u2014 the incentives related to it \u2014 are targeting human ingenuity at destroying that commodity! You\u2019re commodifying it, which is to say compressing its profit margin and increase its supply! Whereas those incentives in Bitcoin are fundamentally different, which we\u2019ll touch on shortly. But the interesting thing here with gold as a commodity or energy money is that it was a stable form of energy at room temperature. Which as we touched on in prior episodes, is akin to the breakthrough with consumer packaged goods, with Post foods, so they could store food energy at room temperature in the form of corn flakes or other canned or dried goods. This also points to \u2014commodification at least \u2014points to this interesting configuration in the world where we have, say, the electric and water networks. And in our civilization they\u2019re clearly the most important, right? If you turned off electricity or water, chaos would ensue! Whereas if you turned off say Google or Amazon, it might be inconvenient, but it\u2019s not necessarily gonna be this whole breakdown in society! But, Amazon and Google are tremendously more valuable on a market cap basis than electric and water networks, and the answer to why is because electric and water networks are commodified. They have become this network that\u2019s so fundamental to civilization that we\u2019ve optimized how we produce and distribute these goods in a way that makes them ultra-cost effective to the consumer. Whereas things like Amazon or Google, they haven\u2019t been commoditized yet. They\u2019re still new enough, they\u2019re newly explored industrial territory if you will. There\u2019s still very large margins there and they\u2019re also monopolists. As we saw earlier in the Steel Age in the railroads and whatnot, in these newly charted industrial spaces you tend to have monopolies first before commodification. First of all the monopolists set standards. Once the standards are set, the commodification sets in and actually compresses the margin and leads us to the more free market environment we have today! So commodification also points to why FAANG stocks \u2014 which are being predominantly used as a store of value today \u2014 since the store of value function of fiat has been so compromised, we see a lot of institutional capital pulls, high net worth individuals, everyone really, that would typically depend on fiat currency as a store of value, resorting to the FAANG stocks or other high-flying tech stocks, as a store of value! Something that is reliably scarce enough to hold its value across time. But commodification \u2014 the history of it, and the economic principles behind it \u2014 actually point towards why that\u2019s a really bad strategy for the long run! Because we\u2019re early in the digital age, these data monopolies, although they could be expected to persist for some time \u2014 years, possibly even decades \u2014 it\u2019s very unlikely that the large profit margins they\u2019re enjoying today will persist far into the future. What\u2019s more likely is that now that standards are established, we\u2019ll see commodification of some of these digital utilities that are monopolized today! If history is any indicator. So in that way the FAANG stocks, although they\u2019re like a primary store of value today maybe second only to government bonds, and increasingly so now that government bonds are largely going negative, they make for a really poor long term store of value. And this also points to Bitcoin and the uniqueness of it in that Bitcoin is like the ultimate store of value through this lens of commodification, because it actually resists commodification! So Bitcoin mining is this race to produce hashes more cheaply. We\u2019re thinking about hash as a vote or a lottery ticket trying to solve the puzzle to win the coinbase reward, which is the newly minted Bitcoin in every block every 10 minutes. So the commodification of Bitcoin is actually in the energy being allocated into its network, however \u2014 and this is where Bitcoin is so unique \u2014 is that, every 4 years, the algorithm adjusts itself in such a way that it actually pushes back on this commodifying force by cutting its new supply flow in half! So at the halving, the operation and energy expense being allocated to generate a hash\u2014which is to create Bitcoin basically\u2014that same cost flows into half as much Bitcoin being produced! So as Bitcoin is undergoing this downward pressure to cost of production as people figure out how to generate hashes more cheaply with cheaper energy or better ASICs or whatever the breakthrough is, the algorithm pushes back every 4 years! You\u2019re pressing down cost to production in one way, but every 4 years we\u2019re gonna double it! And that\u2019s actually the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin so interesting, because that keeps ratcheting it\u2019s marginal cost of production higher, and as we know by studying commodities and money, that the marginal cost of revenue or the market price tends to converge to the marginal cost of production. So the algorithm actually has this rising floor cost of production, and that\u2019s what\u2019s ratcheting its market price higher and higher! And if you look at the price action of Bitcoin historically on the log scale matched over these halvings you see it perfectly! It\u2019s not to say that that will hold indefinitely into the future, but it\u2019s definitely very unique in that we\u2019ve never seen an asset that has this \u2014 at least we\u2019re 12 years in \u2014 very predictable and algorithmically driven market value. It\u2019s definitely influenced by the algorithm! So that\u2019s really interesting and really unique to economics. The other thing that\u2019s interesting to me about that is it\u2019s inverting the economic principles behind commodification. So if you think: the ratcheting effects in, say, gold production will actually be to produce gold more cheaply over time. So just make gold more and more cheaply over time, which actually points to why gold was selected as money because it was so resistant to commodification! You couldn\u2019t get the cost of gold production lower because it\u2019s so scarce and hard to produce! But because Bitcoin\u2019s pushing back, instead of all of that energy flowing into producing cheaper Bitcoin, it\u2019s actually pushing us to just seek out cheaper energy, so it\u2019s created this global perpetual incentive scheme to figure out cheaper ways to make energy. Because that\u2019s the only way to access cheaper Bitcoin production, effectively, although Bitcoin just keeps getting harder to produce! [1:32:23] So it\u2019s just really really unique economics to think about! And then we went into the settlement aspects of Bitcoin, and why comparing it to another crypto asset is simply the wrong comparison. Saylor made a great point that, if you want to compare the cost to settle in Bitcoin, you have to compare it to gold, because with gold, you are settling in finality. If I flip you a gold coin, you put it in your pocket and walk away, you and I have participated in an irreversible transaction! There\u2019s no authority in the world that can make you give me that coin back, and there\u2019s no authority in the world that can \u2014 aside from gold mining \u2014 that can devalue that coin! So we\u2019ve transferred a token of self-sovereign wealth. It is a final transaction, a final settlement. And there\u2019s only one other asset in the world that lets you do that in a fully depoliticized way. You could argue that Ethereum allows you to do that, but Ethereum is subject to political attack vectors, we don\u2019t know its whole supply, there is a small group of people that control its functioning, whereas it\u2019s just not true for Bitcoin. It\u2019s the only truly decentralized digital asset in the world! So that points to another way to think about Bitcoin. Another analogy that we went into was the superconductive monetary network. It\u2019s a lossless energy network. So we can now transmit this meta-energy that is money across time, across space, across jurisdictional domain, governmental domain, with the least amount of loss! And the analogy there to superconductivity is that superconductivity is effectively cooling the conductive material to a very low temperature. So a very low entropy medium, and by getting the entropy out of the channel, it maximizes the flow of energy! There\u2019s the least impedance or the least friction in the channel. And I love that analogy for Bitcoin, because that\u2019s the breakthrough that Bitcoin is, right? It\u2019s the first asset we have in history that has absolute zero-percent noise in the channel, which is: unexpected supply and inflation. Everyone knows and can agree to what the supply is and what the supply ever will be! And the other thing that analogy points toward is that it\u2019s very expensive to achieve that! There\u2019s a great deal of energy expenditure necessary to achieve superconductivity, or to achieve this breakthrough, but once you get there, you release all of these productivity gains! Again, kind of like that phase transition to a lower energy state: when it crystallizes, it just throws off this exothermic reaction of value, cash flow, profit, whatever it is! That\u2019s what Bitcoin\u2019s done! We\u2019ve now had this singular moment breakthrough which we could call the Genesis block\u2014pretty everything from there is a step function of the algorithm\u2014that is now releasing all of these gains into the world in terms of reducing frictions to trade, reducing the noise and theft in the channel from inflation, and then giving us a medium of wealth storage that can\u2019t be confiscated! So it\u2019s taken a lot of unpredictability out of money, if you will! And that same achievement can also be analogized to achieving escape velocity, which I thought was a really cool analogy. And that once you get \u2014 you know there\u2019s a huge expenditure to get into orbit \u2014 if you imagine a rocket, how much fuel it has to expend, how much ingenuity and design and science has to go into building a rocket to get it going fast enough away from the Earth to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational field \u2014 but once you get into orbit, all of a sudden your returns on energy expending go to like near-infinity! The example Saylor gave was throwing a baseball in a baseball field. It\u2019ll go a hundred feet if you\u2019ve got a strong arm. You throw that same baseball in orbit, it just goes around the Earth forever! So your returns on energy expended just explode, it just becomes astronomical! And about this Saylor said, Bitcoin is the most efficient system for channeling energy through time and space in the history of mankind. If we just sit with that for a while and really think about the profundity of something like that, and that we are the species that channel energy across time and space. That\u2019s what distinguishes us as man! And here we have the system that has achieved this function to a higher degree than any other system we\u2019ve ever created! That\u2019s the breakthrough that Bitcoin is! It\u2019s something truly remarkable! And it\u2019s why so many of us have decided to devote our life to it, talking about it, educating others! I love the engineering mindset and lens that Saylor brought to this equation. I talked about a lot of these aspects of Bitcoin previously, but I was more focused on the time side, which time too is like absolutely scarce, but it\u2019s more of an experiential aspect of reality. Whereas Saylor is very focused on the energy, which is much more of an engineering or physicist aspect of reality, and much more measurable and objective than even time! So I think it\u2019s kind of saying the same thing, but just speaking to a different audience in a way. I think it\u2019s just really good stuff that he\u2019s bringing to the table! The last part I thought was cool about the absolute zero superconductive monetary network for achieving escape velocity, was the example of the Hubble space telescope. So for the whole history of astronomy, we\u2019ve been pointing our telescopes toward the sky, but we\u2019ve dealt with atmospheric distortion \u2014 something we\u2019ve had to correct for, something that for certain objects far into the distance we just couldn\u2019t even see, and it\u2019s all because we had this distortion of the atmospheric shell that surrounds our planet! But again once we achieved this escape velocity and we got into Earth orbit, we got a telescope up there in the form of Hubble telescope, that when we started to see our Universe in a whole new way with a whole entirely new degree of clarity and precision unlike anything we have ever seen before! Just totally free of atmospheric distortion! And it\u2019s because we eliminated the frictions to visibility, if you will. We\u2019ve eliminated the frictions to communication \u2014 in this case, communicating light to the eye or light to the telescope \u2014 and it gave us this entirely new perspective on the Universe. And I think Bitcoin is just going to do something similar! We\u2019ve eliminated the atmospheric distortions, if you will, of counterparty risk, monetary inflation, commodification \u2014 all of these things that have screwed up every monetary system historically and broken civilization after civilization \u2014 all of a sudden we have this invention through Bitcoin that\u2019s like the Hubble telescope! It exists in an orbit that\u2019s beyond man\u2019s reach \u2014 which is really important, so it\u2019s not vulnerable to counterparty attack vectors \u2014 we all know what the inflation rate is and ever will be, so there\u2019s no unexpected inflation. And it\u2019s just a lossless energy network, as Saylor says! It\u2019s something that\u2019s a really big breakthrough! The other thing there is the price signals that it would propagate. Price signals being the coordinating force in any economy \u2014 they\u2019ve always suffered from these distortions that we just mentioned like inflation and counterparty risk and what have you \u2014 uncertainty in general, entropy, entropy in the channel. By being an entropy-less or entropy-minimized monetary channel, a Bitcoin-denominated world promises to allocate capital more efficiently than ever before! And that may sound kind of economic-nerdy when you say allocating capital, but that means putting people and assets in the right place! So they\u2019re best satisfying wants or best solving problems for the demands of market participants! So it will lead us to a world where more of our desires are more easily satisfied. This is a really really big deal! And Saylor talked too \u2014 I like this \u2014 that there\u2019s kind of two types of people: we have the doers in the world, and we have the nay-sayers. I would also say we could call those the tinkerers and the bureaucrats, or the entrepreneurs and the legislators. And what distinguishes these two people is: one is action-oriented \u2014 willing to fail, willing to take risks, willing to put their skin in the game, whereas the other one is just contrarian \u2014 says things can\u2019t be done. I flash back to the example of the Wright brothers where every intellectual in the world\u2014there was basically consensus among them all that man would never fly! Until these two guys flew in their garage. So it\u2019s a really idea to bet against human ingenuity. If history shows nothing else, it\u2019s that we have this amazing ability to problem-solve in a way that we can\u2019t even fathom! So the point being \u2014 when we looked at a commodity money versus something like Bitcoin \u2014 is that it\u2019s a really bad idea to try and run a monetary system based on a commodity. It\u2019s much better to run a monetary network which is intended to be a system for allocating our time and our energy based on math! Based on a system that has inviolable rules or one that incentivizes fair play versus a twisting of the rules, because that would actually produce the best outcome, and the best moment of play. When rules are fixed, players are gonna play the game to the best of their ability. But when rules are bendable or breakable, you\u2019re actually creating incentives to behave in a corruptive or exploitative way. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is. Through that game theoretical lens you could say that it\u2019s a fixed rule set that no one can change or manipulate. And looking at a money based on a commodity versus a money based on math, Bitcoin is actually channeling human ingenuity in a way that causes it to improve over time, and in a way that causes civilization to improve. Whereas a commodity money is gonna be channeling human energy and ingenuity into the compression of the profit margins on that commodity, and the overproduction of that commodity! So it makes so much more sense to be in a true, digital money with a rule set based in math, versus something based on our ability to produce it in the natural world! It\u2019s such a leap forward in innovation and in potentially civilization advance as well that it\u2019s hard to even comprehend how big of a deal this is! And finally we touched on the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. So although it\u2019s a \u201clossless\u201d monetary system, there is a need \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be a need \u2014 for some resistance in the channel, which we would call transaction fees. And this is essentially the fee we\u2019re paying to the miners for securing the network. And we could think, as Saylor alluded to, the goddess of wisdom always introduced a little bit of friction! It\u2019s kind of like all things exist in opposition. We need something to push against to move forward. You could also think of the transaction fees as the expense or the tax we\u2019re paying to the governors of the network, which the enforcers of the rules are the miners. So in the same way you pay taxes to the government ostensibly to protect and preserve your private property rights, in the Bitcoin universe we actually have to pay this tax to the mining network so that they can secure the monetary network itself and preserve our private property rights in the Bitcoin time chain. So to argue that a crypto asset needs to eliminate the transactions is just sort of ignorant of this fundamental truth that we need it in a monetary network. What we need truly in a monetary network is zero unexpected energy loss or inflation, which Bitcoin provides. So I hoped you guys enjoyed that episode! Again that was our first session on Day 2. We\u2019re now into Bitcoin theory, we\u2019re getting into the Modern Age and it\u2019s only going to get more interesting from here, so I\u2019ll see you in the next episode!"}

We started in August, we were the first public company to make a serious commitment, and then Square followed us, and then Marathon Patent did a pretty big Bitcoin acquisition for their balance sheet a few weeks ago, $150 Million. And then when Tesla did, we\u2019ve now got four public companies in a row that have all made pretty material commitments! Of course, the market\u2019s been enthusiastic! Generally, the market\u2019s been very supportive of all the Bitcoin companies. If you look at Square\u2019s stock, PayPal\u2019s stock, Riot Blockchain\u2019s stock, Marathon\u2019s stock, Microstrategy\u2019s been well treated, I think Tesla of course is the most successful stock of the year. We\u2019ve checked off one question, which was, How will public shareholders view this? And there was some trepidation, and in fact they\u2019ve viewed it enthusiastically! For example, since Marathon did their $150 Million Bitcoin acquisition, their stock doubled! If you\u2019re wondering how the public shareholders will view it, oftentimes the thing that holds back public companies from doing something is their concern about how it will be perceived by their outside shareholders. And because it\u2019s very difficult to meet with outside shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re changing every minute of the day between 9:30 and 4:00 PM, right? Your shareholder base is changing! So it\u2019s like trying to grab onto a whirlpool in the middle of an ocean! You can\u2019t quite get your hands around it \u2014 it\u2019s dynamic! That\u2019s a challenge, but as we came in the conference I thought\u2014first of all, there\u2019s a lot of demand bubbling up! We had a lot of people asking us! A lot of people asking us, How\u2019d you do this? What should we do? There\u2019s illegal issues, regulatory issues, where you trip the 1940 Act, are you gonna need an ETF, what\u2019s the accounting treatment for it, what\u2019s the appropriate corporation governance? You know, rather than try to have one meeting at a time \u2014 Saifedean, you realize at some point, if you had 40 hours of meetings a week for the next 30 years, well that\u2019s like 2,000 times 30, right? What is that, 6,000? You can touch 6,000 people in 30 years! You just can\u2019t go fast enough! So you can\u2019t do these one at a time. So we thought, let\u2019s just go ahead and add it as a track to Microstrategy World, which was all virtual, and I thought \u2014 by the way, Microstrategy World last year was 2,500 of our customers in a room and it cost us $4 Million, and it cost them probably another $6 Million, so we spend $10 Million in 2019 to put 2,500 customers into a convention center. This year\u2019s Microstrategy World, we probably spent 1/15th that much money, our customers spent nothing, so we spent probably 1/30th! We reduced our travel and entertainment and event budget by 97%! We reduced all of our travel and events budget by 98% year over year, if you want an interesting factoid \u2014 98%! So Microstrategy World was pulled off for 97% less money, we had 21,000 people registered instead of 2,500. We thought, We\u2019ll tack on Bitcoin for Corporations as an afterthought. I thought, Well if we get 800 that\u2019ll be good! Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll probably get 1,000. Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll get 2,000! And I went on television and I said, Well I think we\u2019ll get 2,000, and then we had this surge, and the day of the event \u2014 no joke, it broke the Internet! Like it actually broke our video server, and the stress was, we blew through 15,000 people and I was on the phone with my IT people saying, Get more capacity from our vendor! And for like an hour or two hours in the morning leading up to the noon thing we were like maxed out and I was worried! So some enterprising cyber hornets \u2014 I love the Bitcoiners, they\u2019re so enterprising! \u2014 while I\u2019m trying to solve the problem the conventional way, someone turns on livestreaming to YouTube, and they set up bootleg live streaming channels that have thousands of people on them! When we finally got to the noon session with Ross \u2014 who you introduced me to by the way I think, thank you!\u2014 so we got to the noon session with Ross and we had 8,500 come into that session, so I thought I\u2019d have 2,000 and we went to 8,500! I thought I\u2019d have 1,500 companies represented, and it was actually 7,000 companies represented in the live session! And then the live session got bootlegged out and posted on YouTube, went viral, I think we\u2019re up to 250,000 views now! [09:58] So I guess the summary would be: exceeded my expectations! And we had people from Space X there, you know, some of Elon Musk\u2019s companies, we had people from Marathon there. The ones you would expect were there, but of course there\u2019s an avalanche of private companies, and there were a decent number of public companies and treasurers and CFO\u2019s that were lurking. Some of them don\u2019t want to have their names mentioned as you can imagine, because it\u2019s a sensitive topic, right? It\u2019s material for a company! But I think we can call it a success, because on television for the past few days, we\u2019ve had the CEO of GM asked if he\u2019s gonna invest in Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CFO of Twitter asked about Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CEO of Uber asked about Bitcoin! We just had the Miami, Francis Suarez, announce that they\u2019re moving forward to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and it\u2019s become part of the conversation, even to the extent that now people are grappling with the accounting and the volatility issues, which I account to be an incredible success for all of us! Because a year ago, no one would have even discussed this! This morning we had a milestone: in the CFO section of the Wall Street Journal, the challenges of incorporating Bitcoin on the balance sheet for CFOs was discussed in an article, and I think that\u2019s the first time that the Wall Street Journal in the CFO section had ever actually brought up the topic of Bitcoin! So the implication is: it\u2019s in the conversation everywhere! And increasingly, people have to come to terms with why they\u2019re not doing it. And there will be technical reasons \u2014 Oh! It\u2019s volatile, right? I mean, it\u2019s going up 200% a year, but it\u2019s going up, it\u2019s making us large sums of money in a volatile fashion, that\u2019s a technical reason. If you\u2019re an investor and your reason for not investing in something is, It\u2019s making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion \u2014 I\u2019m not even gonna say what I think of that! It\u2019s quite amusing to me! [12:14] But if I had to be criticized, I think I\u2019d like to be criticized for making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion! And then they\u2019re grappling with the accounting issues, because if you hold it as the underlying asset, it\u2019s currently accounted for as an intangible on the balance sheet, which is the most conservative way. Kind of like the way you\u2019d account for patents or things like that. You know, if you hold it as a fund, then it may, under certain circumstances, be accounted for as an investment asset. But then if you have a fund, it\u2019s a security! And if you hold the asset, it\u2019s property and a commodity! And if you have a lot of securities, at some point you might trip the SEC 1940 Act and become a finance company, because you have more than 40% of your assets as securities. There are a lot of nuances and people are grappling with them, but they\u2019re good debates, right? Good discussions to be having right now! And a year ago, no one would have even considered these matters! So we have injected this into the conversation I think around the world, and I think the Bitcoin conference was part of it. Clearly the Tesla purchase was helpful! And I think February 8th, you could call Mainstream Day, Saifedean! February 8th, this year, was the date when the entire story of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset crossed outside of the Bitcoin and the Crypto community, and it was in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Irish News, The Straits Times \u2014 every major financial publication everywhere in the world, and all the mainstream media! I got invited the next day to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, FOX, CNN, NPR! And I\u2019m like, No more! I can\u2019t do any more! But the point is, CNN, NPR \u2014 these are not Bitcoin journalists, these are mainstream sources! So I think the message is exploding into the mainstream \u2014 you could start the clock: February 8th was the day the shot was heard around the world! And that, combined with the Bitcoin for Corporations Summit, placed this in the public domain. The beauty now of course it, I used to meet with 100 people, and I could meet with 10 a week, and then we met with 8,000 people, and then it went viral to 250,000 people, and now we\u2019ve published our Bitcoin Playbook, and that\u2019s out there circulating amongst lawyers and accountants and advisors and investors, and we just let that percolate and I think good things will happen!"}

I was going to say the exact thing that you mentioned which is: one year ago, none of this was going on anywhere! Nobody was talking about any of this stuff! I remember exactly it was one year ago, it was a conference, and I was with somebody who works in a Bitcoin company \u2014 they were talking about some blockchain nonsense \u2014 and I was telling them that the case for corporations really is: hold a small part of your balance sheet in Bitcoin! And especially if you\u2019re operating internationally, it will help you get around banking closures and it\u2019ll protect you from inflation also! The response I used to get when I\u2019d mention this to people was always, No! It\u2019s too volatile! And the accounting would be too much of a headache! There\u2019s no way anybody would do it! And it\u2019s incredible, and it\u2019s almost entirely down to you, how the conversation\u2019s entirely shifted in a year now to the point where we have a complete playbook that the lawyers and accountants can just go to microstrategy.com, download your corporate playbook, and they have the complete guide to how they need to answer those questions, and we\u2019ve already had thousands of them show up! So I think I can\u2019t but commend you for your incredible service to the cause! And this unbelievable contribution of just putting this out there and forcing it upon people! People call it speculation and people say, Well people are just speculating! But I think ultimately, every economic decision is speculation, and maybe the reason this speculation is paying off is because it is a better economic decision! Maybe it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a better asset on the balance sheet and the world is discovering that!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [18:03]: So a couple of thoughts I had. You made this point: you were talking about money progressing from soft to hard. The gold standard was the culmination of commodity monies from glass beads and seashells and stone coins and the like, and copper and brass and eventually we get to gold and gold is pinnacle and silver is next. And so gold is the hardest commodity money, it lasts the longest, and then you make the point: human beings are able to take a longer view! Your time horizon stretches out! If you had seashells as money or carved wood sticks, your time horizon wouldn\u2019t last beyond the rotting of the wood sticks. Or your time horizon wouldn\u2019t last longer than when people trekked off of the seashore to get more seashells. So gold is the hardest money of that time period, and human beings were able to take a long view. They can create longer lasting structures, right? If you have a harder money, you can create a longer lived structure and that structure would be an institution. And the hard money is working against time. Time is the impedance, and the money is flowing through time! So I started thinking about that as an engineer and I thought, Materials progress from soft to hard, and we build with wood and then we build with brick and then we build with stone and then we build with iron and then we build with steel! And steel is, right now, the winner of the materials, and using the hardest material, human beings are able to create the largest and the tallest structures! They\u2019re working against gravity! So time is an elemental force, gravity is an elemental force, so the significance of steel is, I\u2019m able to build a 100-story skyscraper, and the significance of strong money, or gold money, was, maybe I could create a 50 or 100-year old dynasty of some sort. Maybe I could even build a cathedral based upon the gold! Money progresses from slower to faster. When we get to Bitcoin, you\u2019ve got a harder money than gold, so if it\u2019s harder, that means in theory you can build structures like institutions that\u2019ll last longer than the gold institutions or the fiat institutions! I had the thought when Jack Dorsey just announced today that he put 500 Bitcoin into an institution or an endowment to finance Bitcoin development with a focus on Africa and the like. So presumably Bitcoin development, Lightning development, etc. And I thought, 500 Bitcoin will eventually be \u2014 if you don\u2019t spend it \u2014 it\u2019ll be worth $500 Million! We\u2019ll get to $1 Million a coin and then maybe Bitcoin will start to appreciate at 20% a year, 30%, and eventually it\u2019ll slow down, but you could borrow against $500 Million\u2014$50 Million a year \u2014 which is enough to finance a development unit of hundreds of software developers! Forever! You know, a simple rule of thumb: 500 BTC might reasonably support 500 professionals working an organization forever! Okay? Why? Because Number Goes Up, it\u2019s a store of value! If I put the equivalent amount of money into government bonds, the half-life is not gonna support anything, right? 500 BTC you can calculate it today \u2014 500 BTC is $25 Million, right? So $25 Million invested in something which is going up less than 20% a year is losing value! So the S&P wouldn\u2019t work, gold doesn\u2019t even work, they\u2019re both clocking in at 15% a year! Sovereign debt doesn\u2019t work! So the NASDAQ sort of works, it\u2019s going up. Big Tech sort of works, but you couldn\u2019t really say forever with Big Tech, because it\u2019s tied into \u2014 it\u2019s got so many risks and complexities! So if I endow an institution with the hardest money, I could reasonably have a 100-year or multi-100-year time horizon! And I\u2019d look you in the face and I\u2019d say, Yeah! It looks to me like 500 BTC will support 250 people at $200,000 a year, 500 people at $100,000 a year. I mean if you\u2019re supporting people in Africa, developers in Africa, right now the cost per engineer is $25,000-$50,000 a year, probably $25,000 a year! So you could support 500 people forever! Let\u2019s call it 1,000 years! I mean we could go back and forth, but \u2014 so hard money lets you work against time with an institution. And then I think you\u2019ve got this other dimension, which is, Is it smarter and is it faster? Bitcoin is maybe 10\u2013100x harder than gold, and so we can look out hundreds and hundreds of years. But it\u2019s millions of times faster than gold! I pointed this out the other day: if you have a $1 Billion block of gold that\u2019s 30,000 lbs, moving it across the continent is probably a $5 Million, 1,000-hour exercise. 1,000 hours to organize a few 747s, lots of armed guards, lots of diplomatic issues. So $5 Million, 1,000 hours! And if I want to move a $1 Billion block of Bitcoin \u2014 $5, 1 hour! A million times cheaper! A thousand times faster right now! And so that means when money progresses from slower to faster, humans are able to create higher frequency structures, and they\u2019re working against space or against friction! So longer-lived structures have to work against time. How am I gonna endow the foundation for 1,000 years? And higher frequency structures are all about, I need to move $1 Billion of gold every 2 hours! Or $1 Billion of money every 2 hours! Not every 2 months. And the gold, of course, is so low frequency \u2014 it doesn\u2019t oscillate at all, right? I mean, if you have 30,000 lbs of gold, how frequently does it move? I mean, didn\u2019t the French send that aircraft carrier to pick up their gold once, in a century?"}

And it\u2019s kind of like criticizing someone running a power reactor when you\u2019ve got a lighter in your hand, you know? Like, it\u2019s totally unrelated! It\u2019s silly! If you\u2019re gonna compare the speed and the efficiency of Bitcoin, you have to compare it to the gold network, because you need to have final settlement on $1 Billion of money, of tangible property! And you\u2019re not really getting $1 Billion of settlement on a fiat network without so many other things. So I guess my point is: we have something that\u2019s gonna last a lot longer \u2014 it\u2019s harder. And then we have something which moves faster, so you create the potential of high-frequency structures which are inconceivable! Like a bank that actually makes $1 Billion loans and moves the money tangibly every day, every hour, every minute! There are certain structures people can\u2019t conceive of because they never thought about being able to tangibly move $1 Billion of monetary energy in 37 minutes and then move it back! In the crypto world they\u2019ve got this idea of flash loans, maybe that\u2019s the closest thing? I don\u2019t know how enamored I am of a flash loan that lasts for like 400 milliseconds? I don\u2019t know! It seems to me to be interesting but cute \u2014 maybe a little bit more gimmicky? I can definitely see the application of a loan that lasts 87 days! Or 31 days! Or maybe moving a block of money for 187 days! If I can do it with two institutional counterparties without the banks in the middle and the governments in the middle \u2014 and we\u2019ll get to this in a second, this fiat issue \u2014 that opens up a new world! You could imagine in like 1600 in Renaissance Europe, they\u2019re building buildings with masonry and they\u2019re 5 stories high and someone says, You know one day we\u2019ll have steel and we\u2019re gonna build 100-story skyscrapers and they\u2019ll be shaped differently! You know? And the architects couldn\u2019t even conceive of that because they didn\u2019t have a material strong enough. I don\u2019t think people can conceive of the kind of banks or the kind of institutions that we\u2019ll have with high-frequency money! And I think this last issue is that money progresses from dumber to smarter. Humans are able to create more complex structures and they\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 complexity? Maybe entropy is the word! So we\u2019re either working against time \u2014 we gotta be harder, we\u2019re working against space \u2014 we gotta be faster, we\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 we gotta be smarter! And the material is the semiconductor chip to make us smarter combined with Bitcoin, and the material is the network to make us faster combined with Bitcoin. I mean Bitcoin is basically sitting on the network on the chip getting harder, faster, smarter, and the conclusion you come to is: just like architecture, where I can break the laws of gravity \u2014 what does steel give us? It didn\u2019t just give us 50\u2013100 story buildings! It also gave us cantilevers and it also gave us bridges, right? And Carnegie made all his money by the way \u2014 I read his biography \u2014 his big customers were municipalities buying iron and steel for bridges! Bridges are a pretty big deal! Actually, you could make the argument: bridges may be even more important to civilization than skyscrapers! I mean, knock out the bridges in Manhattan and everybody starves to death! You ever see in a bridge \u2014 the bridge that connects San Francisco and Oakland, or the Bay bridge that connects the eastern shore of Maryland to D.C. \u2014 with the bridge it\u2019s a 1-hour commute. Without the bridge it\u2019s a 12-hour commute! Or it\u2019s an 18-hour drive! In one case I drive to work, in the other case, I don\u2019t! Right? It ends the civilization! So I think this element of money \u2014 I think you put your finger on something very fascinating, which is: as the money gets harder, we can see further into the future with our institutions! But I think, as it gets smarter and faster, we can construct institutions or relationships that are inconceivable before with slow, soft money! And I would say, that takes us to fiat. Fiat is softer money. It\u2019s faster than a block of gold, but it\u2019s still so much slower and stupider than Bitcoin!"}

It\u2019s a machine in a sense \u2014 it has its own truth within it! You can verify it even though it\u2019s a little bit expensive. But with fiat it\u2019s ultimately manual. But today\u2019s use, it is generally faster to move it around than moving around physical gold, but its real drawback as you were saying \u2014 in holding onto value for the future\u2014that\u2019s where it\u2019s really not good and in that sense, the way that I look at it is: the harder the money, the more it incentivizes us to lower our time preference and therefore makes us think more and more about the future, because the harder the money, the less uncertain the future! Because now you have something that\u2014I have this wealth, this monetary energy that I\u2019ve stored \u2014 and I have more certainty in the fact that it\u2019s going to be there in a year or in 2\u20133 years. So 1, 2, 3 years becomes more of a foreseeable thing for me, less of a uncertain thing for me, and so I start discounting less! When I start discounting it less, I start effectively lowering my time preference and providing for the future. And this is why I think the harder got\u2014silver and gold were continuously getting harder and silver was eliminated and gold was hardest\u2014that was the pinnacle of human achievement, arguably! This was when we made the most incredible technology! This was when we invented all these incredible things like the airplane and many, many, many things of the 19th century which I mentioned in The Bitcoin Standard! And I think in the 20th century, maybe we\u2019ve reversed that process because our money is getting easier and so the future is becoming less certain and so we\u2019re becoming more high time preference because we discount the future more!"}

I mean I know as a corporate CEO, in March \u2014 as I was staring at a block of $500 Million US dollars and I was watching the money supply expand and the dollar devalue, my anxiety went through the roof! My anxiety went up so high that it kind of kicked me out of the fiat standard into the Bitcoin standard, right? Like the boiling frog, or jumping out of the boiling whatever! I mean it literally shocked me! It\u2019s all about engineering a mechanism or engineering a security for yourself, right? I mean, steel allows me to stand on a cantilevered structure a hundred feet over a canyon! Or it allows me to stand on a bridge 1,000 feet over the Hudson River or the East River with security! I can even drive a car over it and steel allows me to stand 800 feet in the air! And you imagine the insecurity of that, taking the structure away! Human beings are able to go to places with engineering. Space stations, right? We\u2019re able to go places with engineering, where otherwise you literally can\u2019t live! Like there\u2019s no life there without the engineering! You know, you got me thinking about the fiat standard and some of the criticisms I\u2019ve heard lately about energy consumption of Bitcoin got me thinking about, Well what\u2019s the comparable system? Again the critics are people that\u2014they have a little toy railroad train in their garage and they think, Well my toy railroad train is more efficient than Bitcoin! But they don\u2019t really contrast the energy consumption of Bitcoin to the energy consumption of the alternative system that it is replacing! So if you look at the fiat system, money\u2019s gotta do two things: it\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange and a store of value, and Bitcoin kind of is one structure and the fiat is another structure. So I look at the current system and I think, Well to make this work, when we replace the gold standard \u2014 I mean the gold standard in its \u2014 when commodity money reaches its pinnacle I suppose after all the shuffling around we eventually arrived at gold coins and silver coins! And gold in my opinion is store of value, and silver is the medium of exchange! You know, one of them was the day-to-day currency! A gold coin was like 8 grams, a quarter of an ounce? Feels like it\u2019s about a $500 coin? And so the gold coin is about 1 weeks salary for a laborer, and you wouldn\u2019t have used a $500 or $1,000 coin to pay for things routinely, but if I gave you a stack of ten of them, that\u2019s your treasury! So the silver coin is the medium of exchange, and in that standard you\u2019ve got a very clean structure! Gold coin, silver coin, you mine the gold, you mine the silver, you mint the gold, you mint the silver, you store the gold, you store the silver, they all circulate around! And eventually maybe they\u2019re gold notes, right? Maybe some notes that are fractional or fully reserve-banked \u2014 moving that around. [35:51] When we went to the fiat standard, we replaced that with\u2014the Treaty of Genoa got me thinking about this, Saifedean! \u2014 we replaced this with diplomats, corporations, accountants, lawyers, programmers, security guards, contractors, buildings, armies, software, mints \u2014 we kept the mints, we kept the printers, we kept the gold mines, we kept the vaults, and then we tacked on ideas like ETFs, bond indexes, bond funds, financial managers, and everything else around them, in order to create a medium of exchange and a store of value! I\u2019m trying to figure out how much energy is consumed by\u2014what is it, like 100,000 bank buildings? J.P. Morgan has 200,000 people, so I\u2019m guessing there must be in the finance industry around the world\u2014in the US it\u2019s like 8 Million \u2014 so half of the finance industry is tied up in store of value medium of exchange! So if we could figure it out it\u2019d probably be like 40 Million people in the world! Maybe it\u2019s 20\u201340 Million people! So what\u2019s the carbon footprint and the building footprint and the concrete footprint and the steel footprint and the electricity consumption of \u2014 and I was kind of kind \u2014 I\u2019m not really allocating all the armies and the like, but you could probably say, if you really wanted to keep track of the real cost of the system \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Yeah I mean, the first cost of the system is probably 20\u201330 Million bankers and financial advisors and the like! That\u2019s the primary cost! The secondary cost is all the government infrastructure, the diplomats and the military officials and the aircraft carriers and the armies and the back and forth! I guess the third cost is actually the wars themselves that get waged back and forth! And then I think the fourth cost \u2014 the pernicious cost \u2014 I guess is the inflation! If we\u2019re burning \u2014 you said 7\u20138% was the monetary inflation on average \u2014 if there\u2019s $500 Trillion of monetary assets and you\u2019re debasing 5% of it a year, even, that\u2019s $25 Trillion! So I dunno \u2014 $50 Trillion a year? It must be $50 Trillion! If we could somehow calculate that number \u2014 I mean if you really wanna do something useful \u2014 calculate the cost of the infrastructure, the banking infrastructure, then the governmental infrastructure, and then the first order cost of the currency debasement and the second order impact on the currency derivatives \u2014 the stocks, the bonds, and the real estate! And then after you\u2019ve done that you could throw in the business insolvency and the destruction of good enterprises and the political insolvency \u2014 destruction of good countries, right? The inefficiency of the system results in the destruction of entire countries! I guess the best example being like the meltdown of the Weimar Republic due to the Treaty of Versailles, which was I think largely the result of poor treatment of debt and, following World War I, I mean they pretty much crashed that entire political system because of the way they layered the debt asymmetrically on the Germans and not on the French and the Americans! We know how that one ended! Which wasn\u2019t good for anybody! I think we can see, in the 20th century, we see an example of lots of countries destroyed by the fiat standard. I\u2019m sensitive to all the companies destroyed by the fiat standard as well! The example of that is: as they keep cranking up the monetary expansion rate and as CEOs keep attempting to have their stock hold value, the only way the stock can hold value is to expand the cash flows per share faster than the rate of money expansion! And that means that in an environment where the money\u2019s expanding at 7% a year, if your company\u2019s growing at 3% a year, you can\u2019t store value in the stock, and the political pressure to hold value in the stock causes you to take on massive debt, and then the massive debt is used to either issue dividends or buy the stock back, and so what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019ve taken on $1 Billion of liabilities to actually pump the stock up and then you\u2019re impoverishing the company! Eventually you end up with the company having billions of dollars in debt and no equity, and then when you hit a crisis \u2014 like a technology crisis like Amazon attacks Toys \u201cR\u201d Us while they are insolvent \u2014 or you have a pandemic crisis and they shut down your restaurant and you\u2019re insolvent! So the crises create insolvencies because the companies are undercapitalized because they took on debt under political pressure to keep their stock up! And you could see that playing out even right now, where the majority of CFOs \u2014 like we just saw, I\u2019m not gonna name the CFOs \u2014 but the majority of CEOs and CFOs will say, We\u2019re gonna take our cash and buy our stock back, and conventional financial thinking is: Reward CEOs and CFOs for buying stocks back and issuing dividends, and criticize them for buying Bitcoin or tangible assets with their cash flows! Like, I would be criticized as a speculator taking risks with my balance sheet even though today I have $3.2 Billion of tangible assets on my balance sheet! A year ago I had $500 Million, right? And conventional wisdom is, You should give away the $500 Million and have zero! So conventional thinking is: decapitalize the company! And you\u2019re really ostracized or criticized if you convert cash from a weak asset to a strong asset! Primarily by conventional thinking. I know I said a lot, and I threw a lot out there but I should pause and we should just talk about it because I think there\u2019s a lot of interesting implications and they start with this idea of the fiat system and the fiat standard!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [42:51]: Yeah! That is great! Thank you for that! The cost of the fiat standard is all the things that you mentioned. There\u2019s also the business cycle which is constantly causing misallocation of capital and causes businesses to make malinvestments which get wiped out all the time! And then there\u2019s the fact that \u2014 and this is primarily outside the US , it\u2019s a much bigger problem elsewhere\u2014 which is that you have the countries pay its balances, all of their international account and their current account, all of it is settled with the central bank\u2019s cash balance, which is also used to back people\u2019s deposits in the banking system, and it is also used to buy government bonds, so essentially just financing government bonds. [43:41] And it backs the national currency. So you\u2019re constantly putting all of society\u2019s savings and all of the society\u2019s ability to trade with the outside world essentially as collateral for government to borrow against! And of course, government has high time preference incentives to continue to abuse this all the time, and so it ends up creating all kinds of destruction of savings and destruction of capital. I think that\u2019s really \u2014 well it\u2019s hard to estimate which is the biggest \u2014 but if you think about a century of misallocation of capital, when you think about, How much capital was misallocated? And, How much capital was essentially leaked away from prudent, productive people who have put it away to finance their future and then suddenly saw it go Poof! because their central bank had printed it! And all of that went to finance wasteful government spending and war and investment in things that were not chosen on the market! If you think about the opportunity cost of that over a century, I think the world would be a very different place! And I don\u2019t necessarily have to speculate about technological achievements that we haven\u2019t made, but I think with the things that we have, owning a house with 24-hour electricity and running water is probably something that would be attainable for everybody in the world if money was hard! If you think about it, anybody, particularly people in the poorest country in the world, if they had had gold for the last century, it would be almost trivial for people to be able to secure a modern house with electricity and running hot water as a basic infrastructure! I think the upside of where we would be is almost unimaginable for people in our position! [45:29] But I think the bare minimum would be that: basic technology would be far cheaper all over the world and far more easily available because people could afford them! It\u2019s not that expensive to build an engine that gives you 24-hour electricity! It\u2019s a really simple engineering problem that\u2019s been solved in many places in the world for many many decades. And it just keeps getting cheaper every year! I think the reason that so many people in the world don\u2019t have it is because they have bad money that just continues to lose value. And it ruins their time preference as we were saying earlier! It prevents them from thinking of the future."}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [46:03]: One thing that\u2019s interesting to me is: in the perfect gold standard, the store of value is a gold coin and the medium of exchange is the silver coin. As I read The Fiat Standard, I see we kind of had to abandon the gold standard because we needed faster money and we needed larger quantities of it! You know, we replaced the gold standard with this network of tens of thousands of banks and hundreds of central banks and armies of accountants and lawyers and bureaucrats! The currency was the medium of exchange, the store of value when the fiat system worked \u2014 first they tried the store of value as gold \u2014 it seems like they layered on fiat currency over gold to try to do that, and then over time as the gold got seized and it was synthetic gold or hypothecated gold, and then in 1971 the semblance of that started breaking down and then the store of value in the fiat system was sovereign debt! If we look at the world today, there\u2019s all the currency, and the theoretical store of value, right? If you ask a corporate treasurer, What are you gonna do with your treasury, I need to store my value? Well I don\u2019t hold my cash outright, I would hold it in government debt \u2014 treasuries were the gold. The gold standard is treasuries! And that kind of worked! For example, the currency system \u2014 international currency trading \u2014 used to kind of work! There was price discovery in the market! For example, you remember when Greek debt was trading like 8, 9, 10%, and I remember Spanish debt or Italian debt used to trade 5\u20136%. I would say if you go back to before the EU was formed and you had all these countries with all their different currencies, the currencies were in a competitive market, and if a country wanted to keep its currency from collapsing, you had to raise the interest rate! So you remember when people used to have 12% interest rates and 8% \u2014 under the Volcker regime, we go back to the \u201980s: you had Ronald Reagan \u2014 he was fairly conservative, Volcker was conservative. There you had the fiat standard, but they took the interest rates to 18% in the US! The thinking was, countries had to compete to make the currency viable: you had to have interest rates that were market-set, and in that world you have 8% 30-year bonds and you had 5% bonds. In 2010, short-term interest rates were 5%! So you remember you were saying, Well the money supply was expanding at 7\u20138%, maybe 7% or something! In that world, if I\u2019m a corporate treasurer, I can get 5\u20136% on bonds. Call it credit-worthy bonds, AAA credit. The store of value in the fiat system, when it works \u2014 and we\u2019ll go back to good ole days, Ronald Reagan when it was the good ole days \u2014 when it works you buy credit-grade bonds, AAA-rated, you buy sovereign debt, it yields 4, 5, 6%, the money supply expands either 3% or 7%, say it\u2019s expanding at 7\u20138%, you\u2019re getting a 1\u20132% loss, I give you $100 Million \u2014 the half-life of the money is 35 years! So in that world, you can have \u2014 by the way, 35 years or 30 years is kind of a magic number, it\u2019s your career, Saifedean \u2014 so if I\u2019m a CEO or I\u2019m a corporate treasurer and I\u2019m running on the fiat standard in that time period, I can take my capital, I can put it into like credit-worthy bonds, not take a lot of execution risk, not try to guess what happens with Zoom versus Tesla and I\u2019m not \u201cspeculating,\u201d right? The fiat standard, when it works, gives you sovereign debt and credit instruments that allow me as a responsible corporate treasurer to protect the assets of the company for the next 20\u201330 years, long enough for the company to execute its business strategy. That used to work! But then something started breaking down in the last 30 years! And today it\u2019s busted! There\u2019s no price discovery, sovereign debt is not a store of value! Last week the junk bond index dipped below 5%, it was 4.9%! Okay? The theoretical risk of junk bonds, the risk of default to anybody is 4%, but to a rational person it feels like it\u2019s 8%! It\u2019s 4\u20138%, is the risk on the bond, which means that if you\u2019re getting 4% yield, you\u2019re at best zero and at worst, it\u2019s a negative real yield of 4% or something after credit adjustment! So that tells you that corporate bonds, sovereign debt, and junk bonds are no longer stores of value. And the currencies yield no interest! The US 30-year swap was 72 basis points a year ago. Today, it\u2019s 175\u2013180 basis points! And that\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get! [51:34] The EU 30-year swap is 20 basis points. It\u2019s nothing! There\u2019s no yield! So what can you say? You can say: the fiat standard has broken down starting the year 2020, because at this point there is no tangible store of value where all the traditional treasury instruments are no longer stores of value! Now, when did it start? And I\u2019m going over this in my head \u2014 forgive me, I read your book, you got me thinking, I\u2019m literally thinking about this this morning but I\u2019m thinking \u2014 I\u2019m thinking it started to break down with the Japanese in 1980s. I think the Japanese had a crisis, the crisis was: the digital revolution, computer chip came out, Intel, Microsoft \u2014 the Japanese dominate analog electronics, the world shifts to digital electronics, their exports start slipping, and as the world moves to the Computer Age, the Japanese economy weakens. Their reaction is: the central bank starts to intervene. They\u2019re a closed system and authoritarian, a single government in a closed system under economic crisis. And so they start buying everything, price discovery disappears, asset inflation goes through the roof, real estate in Tokyo goes through the roof, zombie companies start to manifest themselves, the economy freezes! And that\u2019s the first place you start to see the breakdown of the fiat standard! The interest rate goes to laughable numbers! Non-competitive, and it\u2019s like this self-referential closed system \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever! And America looks at it and in America we have 18% interest rates, you know? And so the Japanese response was central bank intervention, and they were the first major country. Maybe not the first, because I\u2019m not a student of China and every other country. I just noticed in Japan. Then what happens next, America has the Reagan revolution and so Reagan and Volcker really define the game plan until 1988. And we have the fiat system lurching toward normal \u2014 you had savings accounts that yield 6, 7, 8% interest! You know, the way you know that there\u2019s a semblance of normalcy is: checking accounts yield 0% and savings accounts yield 8% interest and the banking system offers those things! You know, a savings account allows me to save money! If the money supply\u2019s debasing at 7% a year, the savings account is yielding 7% interest, there\u2019s some hope! When I was a kid, there was hope! And then Clinton came in and Clinton inherited a great economy and Microsoft\u2019s killing it and there\u2019s the Internet revolution and Google and Apple \u2014 this is the rise of America and all of a sudden we thought the Japanese were gonna own everything in America! They were buying the Rockefeller Center, Sony was crushing everybody, etc. So we lurched in 1980, an inflection point! America got its mojo back and we thought technology and the Internet \u2014 that makes us leaders! We didn\u2019t think we were world economic leaders when Reagan was elected! I mean, people really thought the Japanese, they were setting up Toyota plants, there\u2019s a movie Gung Ho \u2014 we thought we were gonna be working for the Japanese! [54:54] The world took a left turn, the Japanese economy missed the digital revolution, and I think this is deep-seated in the Japanese language. It\u2019s a pictographic language, that they didn\u2019t have the programming skills. They missed the digital revolution! America started to rise, the rise of Western Europe, the US started to prosper from digital productivity. And Clinton inherited this very healthy economy from Reagan, and Clinton was kind of a moderate. And we went on to 2000. And what happens in 2000? The EU! And before the EU you had all these different currencies and when you crossed Europe, every currency had to have its own interest rate and its own bank, and they\u2019re competitive with each other! And if a currency prints too much, their currency crashes and no one\u2019s gonna save them! And so there are interest rates! Go look at the interest rates \u2014 they\u2019re real interest rates! It was like a 7%, a 6%, an 8%! Right? There are consequences to irrationality under the fiat standard when there\u2019s 100 central banks and they\u2019re all competing! And you talked about it in your book: there\u2019s all these central banks! The US as a currency swap was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t 87% or 90% of all currency \u2014 it was like 30%! You can see this manifest itself in 1980, because when you had different currency systems \u2014 the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indian, South America, the German bank, the U.K., the French, the US \u2014 they\u2019re all different currency systems. And the US had to raise their interest rates, and there are consequences to our inflation! We had to take our interest rates to 18\u201319% to actually fix that problem! We couldn\u2019t print money with impunity! It\u2019s like pissing in your own bath tub! It\u2019s a small bath tub, and there are consequences to foiling your own bath tub, but when it\u2019s a big ocean, there are no consequences and you feel like you can \u2014 if you print $1 Trillion in a $10 Trillion economy that\u2019s a problem. And if you print $1 Trillion in a $50 Trillion global economy that\u2019s 2%, right? That just goes away! So in 1980, you couldn\u2019t do it! And we started lurching toward globalism, and then the EU was this big change! And what happened? Well the EU came with a light hand, but it was a massive increase in governmental authority and fiat authority. Because now you\u2019ve got an EU central bank! In my opinion, the biggest beneficiary of the EU? When the EU formed, the biggest beneficiary was the US! Because you saw every local country \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Here\u2019s what I saw: when I traveled through Europe in the \u201990s, there were 10 languages \u2014 the menus were in 10 different languages \u2014 10 different currencies, I have to change money at every border, I started with $1,000, I ended with the equivalent of $780 or $900, the money-changing was expensive, and I couldn\u2019t read the street signs! When you travel through Europe after the formation of the EU, all the menus converted to English, EU adopted English as the second language, you converted to the Euro, and if you\u2019re living in Portugal or France or Spain you\u2019re thinking, Well I had to give up Portuguese and Spanish and Italian for English! And I had to give up the peseta and the lira for the Euro, but I might as well just convert it to the dollar! The Italians aren\u2019t gonna adopt French! And so it\u2019s almost like all the Europeans agreed to adopt English, and then they started pegging to the dollar! And the US was the big beneficiary of the formation of the EU, because now everybody had to accept English and the dollar, and that played into TCP/IP and the Internet, and Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and the entire US economy benefited! And it was US San Francisco progressive views, San Francisco technology, US law. The American legal and economic and cultural system encroached on Europe in a big way! We saw the formation of a Western Europe and the United States, a billion-person trading bloc trading in dollars, convertible dollars trading in English language subject to basically US trade law! So what happened next? Well, the EU was weak, and there was a crisis, and it used to be that, if I wanted to buy Italian bonds I could get 7\u20138% yield, and the German bond yield was 2%. And the Germans had the best credit rating and the French were next, but the Portuguese had a weaker one and the Italians had an awful credit rating and their bonds yielded great! And the Greeks, at some point \u2014 you could probably go back and pull the bond yields, it probably tells the story of the death of the fiat standard, right? Or the encroachment of the fiat standard! If you look at bond yields in European countries from 2000-on, there\u2019s a point at which they all pretty much pegged to the EU bond yield, and that was as the EU central banks started taking responsibility for the default of the Greeks. The Greek crisis was probably a seminal event! [1:00:56] When the EU bailed out Greece, that was an expansion of the EU central bank! I almost think about two crises: we had the Great Financial Crisis, when the United States bailed out every bank, and we forced them all to take hundreds of billions of dollars, and we bailed out every European bank with US dollars! And it seems like once we did that, we owned them all! Like, the US dollar as the world reserve currency, it went from being 30% to 40% to 60% to 80% to 90% after that crisis! And it seems like after the debt crisis of Greece, and after the Italian debt crisis when the EU central bank bailed out those countries, the EU kind of owned them as well! The summary is: by the time this is all said and done, interest rates in the European Union have crashed to zero, short-term interest rates are negative, long-term interest rates were like 8 basis points for 30-year money on a swap a few weeks ago! And so what you really got is the massive expansion of the EU central bank and the Fed from the year 2000 to the year 2020. And as they expanded, all corporate debt, all sovereign debt, stopped being an effective store of value! The currencies became dominant and for whatever reason, the US currency just got progressively stronger and stronger from 1980 to the year 2020! And now the entire transformation has taken its hold!"}

The death of the savings account forced everybody probably first into bond indexes and then stock indexes. And today, a 22-year old Uber driver knows that the savings account is worthless! If I have cash at some of these bulge bracket banks, you know in their money market funds? They\u2019re actually charging like \u2014 they\u2019re offering 15 basis points yield and charging 25 basis points management fee! The literal fee is higher than the yield on the account! The marketplace has migrated, and it\u2019s being forced. And stage one was gold, stage two was sovereign debt, and then the rise of corporate, AAA-rated debt. You could almost say that in order to replace the gold standard, we had to have an army of credit rating agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s and S&P and you could say the rise of the junk bond market might be explained by this! \u2014 people desperately chasing after store of value without equity risk. Finally they threw in the towel and they started absorbing some equity risk! And then in 2020, we kind of kicked the thing into high gear, right? March of 2020 is the point where everything just breaks! Like, because 5, 6, 7% money expansion against an 8% S&P index and against a 5% bond yield or 4% credit worthy yield and 8\u201310% junk bond yield \u2014 you can sort of almost make that work, but it stops working when the money supply expands by 25% and the S&P yield is 15% and the junk bond yield is 4%, and the sovereign yield is 0\u20131%!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: I think right now the only two store of values \u2014 the people are smarter in some ways than the politicians and mainstream media, because even the 23-year old Uber driver knows that they\u2019re probably better off to buy Tesla stock or to buy a market basket of technology stocks, or even take a flyer on GameStop, or buy Bitcoin, than they are to put their money in a savings account and wait! I think that what\u2019s happened is, people have migrated, smart money has determined that there\u2019s only two stores of value left! Really smart money that\u2019s brave says, Bitcoin! If you\u2019re really progressive and if you\u2019ve got some courage, then you realize that the best store of value is Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s digital gold! The other layer of smart money that is either very comfortable \u2014 they\u2019re already wealthy, they\u2019ve got plenty of money and they\u2019re comfortable or they\u2019re conventional \u2014 the comfortable, conventional smart money has decided that Big Tech or growth is the store of value. And the best surrogate for that is NASDAQ. If I go right now case for Bitcoin, and I look, what does that show me? ROI 1-year it\u2019s saying Bitcoin is 356% up, NASDAQ is up 43%, gold is up 14.7%, S&P is up 16%, and treasuries are 2%, and your money expansion was 25% or whatever you want to plug in! And if you plug in 15% going forward you can see you\u2019ll tread water with gold and S&P \u2014 maybe! I wouldn\u2019t [with gold]! I think that you\u2019re more likely to tread water with the S&P. I think with gold, gold is in a ballistic trajectory \u2014 it got a boost in the crisis \u2014 now it\u2019s losing momentum, it\u2019s broken down in the last 6 months and it\u2019s about to crash! And you\u2019re going to see people short gold, reallocate from gold, the price is gonna crash! And it\u2019s probably the scariest possible investment right now, because gold only exists as long as people are looking for a non-sovereign store of value, and you only need one, right? And there\u2019s only one that can be! And you pretty much have to be brain-dead to be allocating to gold versus Bitcoin in the year 2021! You\u2019re just gonna have to go through like mental gymnastics! So I can buy the argument that I buy a market basket of all the stocks, because you\u2019re just buying the economy, but I can\u2019t really buy the argument of gold anymore! And of course, treasuries are disasters because you\u2019re long money \u2014 not only are you taking on cash that\u2019s losing 15% of its purchasing power a year, you\u2019re locking yourself in for 20\u201330 year duration! By the time you get the cash back you\u2019re going to have lost 95% of your money, so that\u2019s just foolish! But you\u2019ve got growth, right? Everybody wants growth! They\u2019ll take growth discounting risk to zero! They\u2019ll even take the prospect of growth, right? Like if you just tell me a story, and if I can\u2019t have growth then they\u2019ll buy GameStop because at least there\u2019s the potential of \u2014 if I can\u2019t have growth, I\u2019ll take speculation of growth, and if I can\u2019t have speculation of growth, I\u2019ll just take speculation of a short squeeze! All of those are more compelling than anything left in the fiat system!"}

Sure, there will definitely be stocks and investing in stocks has its place, but I think for the store of value market, that\u2019s going to distinct from money that you want to risk on high growth, high risk stocks! So the interesting thing will be to see how this develops! Now you\u2019ve been saying that you don\u2019t think Bitcoin threatens the dollar. So would you say that Bitcoin threatens treasuries, but doesn\u2019t threaten the dollar and therefore we can continue to see maybe just more inflation in the dollar, but governments continue turning value against Bitcoin and continue to collect taxes from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin replaces their treasuries, puts them on a tight leash, and makes their inflation a little bit more transparent, but their dollar continues to survive! Is that how you see it?"}
{"link": "https://saifedean.com/podcast/34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standard/", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #34. Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [1:10:46]: Yeah I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very constructive for the community to focus upon Bitcoin replacing the dollar! It\u2019s a crypto-anarchist idea! I could be more supportive of Bitcoin replacing the Zimbabwe dollar, or the Venezuelan Bolivar! Like, in a government where all of the institutions of government have broken down, an utterly corrupt, dysfunctional government where they can\u2019t function anymore, and that\u2019s a hyper-inflationary environment \u2014 I\u2019d probably be more supportive of that! Because there, people are going to starve to death! So there\u2019s billions of people in collapsing economies where the currency is collapsing. There, some kind of stable currency \u2014 it might be even a stablecoin like the US dollar sitting on a crypto-rail backed by Bitcoin, which might be what Tether is or what something is \u2014 I think that that\u2019s probably got a value, that\u2019s probably got a place! But in the United States and in Europe, as the fiat currency expands, it maintains its place as a medium of exchange and a lawful currency and as legal currency. And it will, and we should hope it will, because I don\u2019t think anybody wants France or Germany or the US to look like Zimbabwe, right? I mean those are literally countries where the rule of law and the right to property break down! When the rule of law and your right to freedom of speech or the right to life, liberty, and property break down, you\u2019ve got a situation of true anarchy! And then \u2014 I suppose if you\u2019re a crypto-anarchist and you support reinstalling free speech and right to property via a crypto network \u2014 I get that! That makes sense! But in a country that has a rule of law and a right to property, the logical thing that happens is, when people lose faith in the currency, they migrate to gold! When gold isn\u2019t fast enough \u2014 by the way, gold is an antiquated, elitist asset! I mean, the criticism of gold that people should focus on is that it\u2019s elitist! How do 500 million people buy $1,700 worth of gold? Calculate: what is the mark up on $1,700 worth of gold coins purchased $87 at a time, right? Isn\u2019t that like 40% mark up? Like, aren\u2019t you looking at \u2014 I mean elitist is, I\u2019m gonna basically pay double! I mean even coins are expensive! If you want to get gold at a reasonable price you have to buy a bar of London good delivery gold, which is 400 ounces at a time \u2014 that\u2019s $800,000 blocks of gold\u2014and you probably have to buy five of them from J.P. Morgan to get treated anywhere close to reasonably, right? So gold is an elitist store of value. It is not accessible to the billion people in the Western world \u2014 in Western Europe and the US! It\u2019s certainly not accessible to the 7.8 Billion people on the planet! And so, if you\u2019re going to deliver a store of value to everybody with a mobile phone on Earth, Bitcoin is your best bet! Bitcoin is gonna be running transaction fees of less than 1%. 1\u20132% would be high, you know? Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be nothing compared to the cost to acquire and store and maneuver gold! Gold is elitist and gold is antiquated, because I can\u2019t move $37 worth of gold from point A to point B to pay for an Uber ride! I can\u2019t fund with gold! Gold is not bankable! Gold is slow money. With Bitcoin, we\u2019re on the verge of a world where you\u2019ll have $1 Trillion of Bitcoin\u2014you can plug a billion consumer accounts into it and you can offer people the ability to borrow against the Bitcoin at 4% interest! J.P. Morgan offers you securitized loans up to loan-to-value 50% against conventional assets at LIBOR +50 basis points if you\u2019re an institutional customer! You could get LIBOR +200 basis points if you were a consumer! You\u2019re talking about 2\u20133% interest! So in a world where a major bank were to plug into Bitcoin, there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t get to a point where a billion people could borrow money against Bitcoin at 2% and then never sell the Bitcoin forever! I think in the next 36 months we\u2019ll see 4\u20135% consumer loans against Bitcoin! When\u2019s the last time you got a loan against gold? No! And then we\u2019re onto this next thing which is, Okay, we\u2019ll write off gold. Well what\u2019s next? Bond indexes? No. So we migrate to stock indexes! I think the free market in the Western world is inventing asset classes to serve as stores of value, and they\u2019ve been doing them legally and ethically, and the government allows you to create asset classes! I mean, when $1 Trillion moved into the Vanguard 500, the S&P 500, the government didn\u2019t block that! So I think that the right way to think about it is: Bitcoin as a store of value asset class, as digital gold, growing to be $10 Trillion, and then $20 Trillion and then $40 Trillion. The big model I have is a monetary planet. And let\u2019s say the monetary planet is $500 Trillion, it\u2019s a gaseous planet! The outside of it is $100 Trillion worth of M2 or M3 money \u2014 currency, derivatives and the like \u2014 Euros, Dollars, etc. And so that\u2019s currency that\u2019s moving through all the governments on Earth, and that\u2019s gonna continue as long as there are governments on Earth! Then inside of that is $400 Trillion worth of other assets, and it\u2019s broken up between real estate and collectibles and stocks and credit instruments and bonds and derivatives. $350 Trillion of the $400 Trillion \u2014 I dunno, maybe it\u2019s not that \u2014 maybe $200 Trillion of the $400 Trillion is what I\u2019ll call currency derivatives! Their value is based substantially or in part on the discounted value of the future cash flows of the asset. So stock\u2019s valued on future cash flows, commercial real estate\u2019s valued on future cash flows, and bonds valued on future cash flows. Those are currency derivatives. Now inside that is a higher quality set of assets \u2014 I\u2019m gonna call them trophy assets, collectible assets! A beach house in the Hamptons, Palm Beach, a Picasso \u2014 even a trophy equity, to the extent that own Disney because I love Disney, because I love Mickey Mouse, because Mickey Mouse was part of my formative experiences! A trophy piece of debt, it\u2019s a piece of debt for the Children\u2019s Hospital in my neighborhood because they saved my kid\u2019s life. Like something that you would hold and you would value because it\u2019s part of your self-identity! A football team, a soccer franchise \u2014 things that people love and they would hold them irregardless of the forecast of the discounted cash flows into the future. Your personal home \u2014 your personal home has value to you, your personal car, your personal yacht, your personal plane! These things have value to you because you love them and they will be pried from your cold, dead fingers! And it doesn\u2019t matter what the interest rate is \u2014 it\u2019s your house! It\u2019s your lake house! So that stuff is a harder asset. And then in the middle of that is a $10 Trillion hardcore gold which we\u2019ll call non-sovereign store of value fungible money. And inside that, in this burning red-hot thing at the center of the Earth \u2014 that\u2019s crypto! There\u2019s a Trillion-dollar crypto fire in the middle of the $500 Trillion planet! And that Trillion-dollar crypto fire was started from a spark by Satoshi, and it\u2019s burning and it went from a Billion to $10 Billion to $100 Billion to a Trillion \u2014 the Bitcoin fire! And that is the hardest, fastest, smartest, strongest monetary asset in the history of the human race! And it is expanding and it is boiling these things, and it is boiling gold! And the first thing it\u2019s gonna do is it\u2019s gonna replace gold, and gold will collapse into the crypto fire! And then it will suck in sovereign credit instruments, negative-yielding sovereign debt, to the extent that that\u2019s held as a store of value! It will subsume some debt indexes and some equity indexes. And it\u2019ll probably expand from $10 Trillion to $20 to $40, $80, $100 Trillion, and it could get all the way to say $200 Trillion, and when it\u2019s $200 Trillion, it\u2019ll be the stabilizing framework and the gaseous monetary planet will go from $500 Trillion up by 10% to $550, maybe it\u2019s +15% a year, right? If it\u2019s +15% a year, your $500 Trillion monetary planet will expand to become an $800-$900 Trillion \u2014 what\u2019s after a trillion, is it a quad \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: We\u2019re headed toward a Quadrillion \u2014 a Quad planet! And Bitcoin will expand at 250%-300% a year\u2014for the last decade \u2014 and that\u2019s about as fast as it can go, because anything faster than that rips the wings off the airplane! People ask, How fast can human beings accept change? I think, if you look at the history of business, companies growing faster than 200% a year are rare! I mean, that\u2019s pretty much as fast as it can go! So it\u2019ll go 200%, and it\u2019ll track that way, and then I think at some point when it crosses gold, it\u2019ll slow down to 150% and 120% \u2014 you could probably work it out over the next 20 years as it goes from a Trillion to $200 Trillion! It might take 30 years. It might take 20 years. It might take 10 years. Somewhere between 10\u201330 years, right? If you look at the rate. And where we\u2019re headed is: a world where there\u2019s 8 billion people on the planet with a mobile phone, and those 8 billion people are storing value in digital gold, and probably that mobile device is gonna have a hardware wallet embedded in it that\u2019s gonna be the token, and you\u2019ll have multi-signature multi-hardware wallets securing digital gold which has become \u2014 I dunno what is it gonna be, a third, or half? \u2014 you have to ask the question theoretically, Saifedean! What portion of the monetary planet should rationally be store of value? And I think it\u2019s self-equibilating, because as more monetary energy \u2014 it\u2019s like magnetism, you\u2019re de-magnetizing something, you\u2019re de-monetizing something! \u2014 as more monetary energy falls off of gold and off of silver and then off of indexes into Bitcoin, price discovery will return to these other assets! So price discovery\u2019s gonna return to gold and it\u2019s gonna return to its ornamental and antique value! And price discovery will return to silver, and price discovery will return to stocks and bonds. What you can assume is that in a free market, price discovery will return, the bond prices will fall, the yields will increase, real estate prices will fall, the yields will increase for commercial real estate, you will see stock prices fall, dividend yields and yields will increase \u2014 everything will rationalize in a free market. Market dynamics, conventional market theory dictates that: no asset can be any more attractive than any other asset in a free market, because capital will flow and migrate so as to equalize the expected return on all assets! Now what you\u2019re gonna see is certain markets become not free! The way you break that is you pass laws! The extreme cases will what you\u2019re seeing going on in India right now. What you saw in China makes it impossible to convert your RMB into Bitcoin. And India\u2019s threatened by it, Nigeria\u2019s threatened by it. You\u2019re gonna see back and forth, and you\u2019ll see some countries will embrace it and other countries will run from it! But you know, the Chinese made Google, Twitter\u2019s illegal, Facebook\u2019s illegal, right? That\u2019s gonna happen! And it didn\u2019t stop them from being successful other places! I think you\u2019ll probably see the Western world will embrace digital gold, I think you\u2019ll see banana republics, corrupt regimes, attempt to resist it! On the other hand, I\u2019ve traveled all through China and everybody\u2019s got a VPN and they\u2019re looking at Twitter and Facebook accounts with VPNs! It\u2019s really difficult \u2014 can they actually stop it? Not really, right? I mean they can\u2019t stop it, they actually have a hard time stopping money traveling on crypto rails over VPNs and the TOR network. On the other hand, will they suffer from it? Yeah! There\u2019s a big cost to not have Google! I mean there\u2019s a big cost to not have YouTube, right? There\u2019s a big cost to not have electricity! There\u2019s costs to reject technology! If your money moves a million times faster, then that means the cost of capital for the world that embraces the technology drops, and that means that innovation accelerates! And you can cling to your gold coins and your giant stone coins of the Yap people and whatever, but at some point \u2014 there\u2019s a cost not having Google Maps, man! Cars that don\u2019t drive themselves, you know? There\u2019s a cost! And eventually it reflects itself in the Cuba standard of living, or the North Korean standard of living, and even the Chinese can\u2019t necessarily stop this thing! So bottom line is: I think the fiat system is going to continue as a currency, and it should! The currency rails work fine! What people still haven\u2019t got through their head is, I could have 150% of my assets in Bitcoin! You can have a million dollars, you can buy $1 Million in Bitcoin, you can mortgage your house, buy another $500,000 in Bitcoin, you could take out a personal loan against your future earnings if you\u2019re a doctor \u2014 buy another $500k in Bitcoin! If it was me, I\u2019d mortgage my house, I\u2019d sell my gold, and I would raise debt and I would buy Bitcoin! You can have 100% of your assets in Bitcoin, get a bank that will give you a loan against Bitcoin, if Bitcoin is going up at 25% a year, and if your expenses are going up at 5% a year, you can borrow money to pay for your coffee and to pay your rent and to drive your car and to live your life forever!\u2014 never pay it back \u2014 keep the Bitcoin, and your debt-to-equity ratio will fall! And so at some point you could literally fund everything in Bitcoin, and so you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar is my point! You don\u2019t really want to spend Bitcoin! What you want to do, is you want to plug your Bitcoin account into a Visa card, and you want to pay for things with Visa, and you want to run up a debt, and you never want to pay it off, and you want to die owing money! It\u2019s not that complicated! You have a million dollars and it doubles every year \u2014 you eventually have $100 Million, you can spend $100,000 a year going up at 20% a year, or you can spend $100,000 going up at 50% a year, and you will die with $90 Million of equity, $10 Million in debt, never having paid tax! And you don\u2019t need to replace the Euro, you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar, you don\u2019t need to get rid of your Visa card, right? Those things don\u2019t matter!"}
{"link": "https://saifedean.com/podcast/34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standard/", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #34. Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [1:28:23]: Yeah I think another argument in favor of this is the fact that maybe Bitcoin is actually reducing the demand for the creation of dollars and Euros because if people don\u2019t buy as many treasuries as they do, then fewer dollars are created. People don\u2019t get into as much debt, and fewer dollars are created. And so if people are holding Bitcoin instead of holding debt instruments on their balance sheet then less debt takes places, and the key concept in The Fiat Standard is that fiat is debt. So basically Bitcoin reduces the demand and the supply for fiat! But I guess it\u2019s unfortunately it\u2019s not a choice we get to make, it\u2019s an outcome of markets. So the question is: Can the dollar hold on? And can printing the dollar manage to maintain the Bitcoin storm? I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see! But there are reasons why we can see Bitcoin continue to grow without the dollar having to collapse. I\u2019ve got another question for you, switching gears a little bit: you waltzed into the Bitcoin world at a very very good time, you know! You came in at what was it $7, $8, $9,000, and within a couple of weeks we are now almost at $50,000 \u2014 it\u2019s at $47,000 I think right now. Obviously part of that is probably you and the impact that you have had \u2014 all the evangelism that you\u2019ve done! But also, we\u2019ve had periods in Bitcoin before where prices have declined for quite a while, so if this was high school, you would be signing up for high school the week of the prom and the graduation! You didn\u2019t sit with us through the dark days of holding the \u2014 buying the $1,000 top and watching it go down to $150 over two years! So I\u2019m wondering: you went in at a time where this was a possibility! We could have had another two years, you know? You may have chanced upon Bitcoin in 2018 and Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed much between 2018 and 2020, but if you bought in March 2018 you would\u2019ve witnessed the decline for quite a while! So I\u2019m wondering, was your entry, were you just thinking, Alright, this is now better technology \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna be buying as much as I can! Or was there some kind of price analysis going on in a sense of, We\u2019ve consolidated for a while, so most likely we\u2019re gonna be getting another jump! Would you have bought as aggressively in 2018? And do you follow any particular models for thinking about the price?"}

That was the risk/reward point where the risk had diminished by 99%, and the return and the use case had amped by a factor of 100! It was an inflection point in March of 2020! Look, I wouldn\u2019t have bought it at all in February of 2020! I didn\u2019t know it existed \u2014 I didn\u2019t really care to think about it! The world was totally different in February versus in April, so I think March is the beginning of the new era. I think that people in the Bitcoin industry, I think to a certain degree, they\u2019re biased by their history, and it\u2019s a liability for them. I think it\u2019s baggage that they should lose! I think that most people in the Bitcoin industry \u2014 most people in business, most people in life, they want to draw on their experience, because there\u2019s a bias that, I want to make decisions based on my experience, and I want to feel that everything that I experienced was worthwhile! And if I felt pain, I would like for it to have meant something, right? So what if I looked at you and I said, Saif, nothing that you experienced between 2010\u20132020 was relevant! And you could basically flush it all down the toilet and take a clean sheet of paper and start again! That doesn\u2019t feel good! Right? Psychologically it\u2019s hard to let go of that, but let me give you an example of inflection point: for 10 years before March [2020], we had tried to use video conferencing and I used Webex. And my experiences were uniformly awful for the entire 10 years! I could probably write a book on all of the bad meetings and all of the awful dysfunctional business results that came from that, and I fired people that wanted to use video conferencing and wanted to work remotely the previous year! Okay? And I had lots of experience! And then in March we decided to use Zoom and Zoom was 100x better, and I had only good experiences! And the truth of the matter is, the entire decade of experience that I had with video conferencing was of no value whatsoever! It actually just saddled me with a prejudicial bias because I had scars and I had pain, and it\u2019s all irrelevant! So after March, everybody on Earth needed Bitcoin! 1,000 companies! You heard Ross last week, he said, I had 20 clients at the beginning of the year, I had 280 institutional clients at the end of the year, I have 90 in the pipeline now. Ross will have 1,000 clients! He\u2019ll go from 20 to 1,000! All of his experience before March, all of your forecasts before March \u2014 irrelevant! It\u2019s what I said to Keith McCullough, All your models \u2014 destroyed! Why are they destroyed? Because they\u2019re based upon the statistical interaction. A tidal wave hits the beach! Okay? I drop a bomb on your head! Your entire history living in the town or playing on the beach \u2014 irrelevant! Irrelevant! You want it to matter \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! When $100 Trillion of capital comes through a nozzle \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! If you took every trade of Bitcoin from the point that Satoshi did the whatever and the pizza transfer took place, all the way through the blow-off top, all of it is irrelevant! Let me explain it a different way: if Elon Musk woke up tomorrow and decided, Screw it! I\u2019m buying $10 Billion of Bitcoin instead of $1.5 Billion of Bitcoin! That one decision renders irrelevant all of the studying of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory between today and last March! One person, one thing, makes a difference! And likewise, March rendered irrelevant the statistical models in the history before! What\u2019s going on right now is, on February 8th, on Monday, the day that you woke up, if you read the news, the world changed again! You have to keep redoing your models! The human race, I mean \u2014 read Paleo-theory: we ran around getting chased by wolves and apes for 3\u20134 Million years, starving to death! Life was difficult! And 10,000 years ago we invented agriculture \u2014 life changed again! 100 years ago \u2014 life changed again! The life of a human being today: the challenges, the dynamics \u2014 how many children get up and worry about getting eaten by a wild animal today? It\u2019s irrelevant, right? The history of the human race is irrelevant to a decision \u2014 like, you\u2019re gonna get in a car and drive the car? You can kill yourself in 3 seconds! What matters is, you\u2019re in the frickin\u2019 car! When you engineer a new system, it completely renders irrelevant your history! If I take a gun and I point it at your head\u2014and there\u2019s a bullet in it \u2014 nothing in the world that you\u2019ve lived through matters other than: can you get me to not pull the trigger? Everything else is irrelevant! And so, engineering machines, and when your circumstances change \u2014 when you\u2019re skiing down a ski-slope and there\u2019s an avalanche, all your skill as a skier \u2014 rendered irrelevant! All your skill as a human being! It\u2019s back to this issue of the guy that was the chairman of HNA \u2014 he was the richest guy in China, worth $30 Billion! 2 years ago? He went hiking in the South of France, stood on a rock wall, had a selfie taken, tripped and fell to his death! All of his money, all of his models, all of his lawyers, 87 Million frickin\u2019 people in China \u2014 irrelevant! In 1 second, he broke the law of gravity and he died! The point here is: Bitcoin has moved into a different zone, a phase shift! It was in one phase from 2010\u20132015, it went through another phase 2015\u20132018. When Bitcoin pulled ahead after the fork wars it moved into a different phase. And then in 2020 it moved into a different phase. And at the point that publicly traded companies started buying it and institutions started buying it and mainstream media started coping with it, when a Senator got elected, the mayor of Miami Beach, Senator Cynthia Lummis \u2014 when these things happen, when Gary Gensler takes his role at the SEC \u2014 you\u2019re in a different phase! And so, you have to recalibrate all of your models based upon a whole new set of assumptions. And it\u2019s like I took the spear out of your hand, I gave you a bow and arrow! The human race changed! I take your bow and arrow out of your hand, I gave you a gun! I take the gun out of your hand and I give you a bomb! As I change the engineering, the outlook changes and you cannot draw on your history anymore! You have to think differently!"}

It\u2019s been doing 1 block every 10 minutes for the past 12 years throughout all of these phases! And Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and market dynamics have not changed much! We\u2019ve gotten these big bull runs after the halvings every single time. So far, it\u2019s extraordinary what has happened in Bitcoin over the last year, but it isn\u2019t extraordinary by the standards of Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s happened before! So the question is: will this time be different, do you think? Have we moved into something fundamentally different after 2020 or would we still see a market cycle similar to what we had before?"}

For example, Bitcoin is not just the underlying blockchain \u2014 Bitcoin is the banks that are plugged into Bitcoin! So, Fidelity is a Bitcoin bank, Coinbase is a Bitcoin bank, Binance didn\u2019t exist 4 years ago\u2014it\u2019s a Bitcoin bank. The CME is a Bitcoin bank, PayPal and Square are Bitcoin banks, Microstrategy and Greyscale are Bitcoin banks! Those are radically different things! Probably PayPal and Square will, between the two of them, they will sell Bitcoin to \u2014 what do you think, 20\u201330 million people this year? The holders of Bitcoin have changed, the investment communities have changed, the narratives changed, the use case has changed, the way that people buy it has changed, and the technology to buy it \u2014 for example, I buy $200 Million of it, I do it with 88,000 transactions, every 3 seconds buying Bitcoin $2,000 a second! And I buy it to hold it forever! That\u2019s change! Look at all the Bitcoin that Greyscale bought \u2014 it\u2019s locked up in a trust! Do you know how that will be sold?"}

The construction of the trust is such that, when the money flows into the trust, they buy Bitcoin, there are GBTC shares that are issued. Those shares can be sold and the price of the shares \u2014 the derivatives can go down \u2014 the underlying Bitcoin can never be sold per the charter! Ever! Ever! So you see, there are fundamental different things that are going on! Last I checked they had $30 Billion of Bitcoin. That\u2019s $30 Billion of Bitcoin that can\u2019t be sold! Okay? Held by institutions! A very different world! So these are sources of inertia falling into Bitcoin. And the volatility is not the same! If you look at the drawdowns, they\u2019re not the same. Like when Bitcoin ran up to $40,000 it traded by down to $30,000 \u2014 that was a 25% retracement. Not an 80% retracement!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Yes! I do! Let me say it a different way: if you\u2019re a Boy Scout and you\u2019re shivering in the freezing cold and you\u2019re attempting to start a fire for the first time, you recall how difficult it is to start a fire and then you recall going to sleep without a fire and then maybe your friend froze to death and you\u2019re mortified by it! But then one day you grow up and you have a furnace in your house, or maybe you plug into someone else\u2019s electrical system and you have an electrical heater \u2014 you\u2019re not a Boy Scout anymore! Right? It\u2019s a totally different world, and the system, the network, is much more mature, it\u2019s just much better engineered, there\u2019s much more monetary energy in it, there\u2019s much more inertia. I mean ultimately, there\u2019s massive amounts of monetary inertia in the system! It\u2019s like an air compressor. We\u2019re compressing energy in a monetary battery and it\u2019s accelerating if you look at the rate at which energy is flowing into it! And as that energy flows, it\u2019s stabilizing! So the more monetary energy flowing in the system, the more stable it is, the more inertia it is, the more difficult it is to change the direction, and the less volatility it has! And I think that you\u2019re gonna continue to see that as these banks evolve! It\u2019s very clear to me ever since March, you can literally see the volatility and the instability in the entire network being damped by rational actors!"}
{"link": "https://saifedean.com/podcast/34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standard/", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #34. Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [1:44:13]: Let me give you my counter-case: I think ultimately, the more money comes into Bitcoin, the more the price goes up, the problem there is that you start getting more and more Bitcoin minted, so effectively Bitcoin becomes more inflationary as the price rises and I think this might be why the halving dynamic always will have a big rise but also a crash, because over the past 4 years in the previous halving period we had 4 years in which we were making 1,800 Bitcoins a day worth on average 7, 8, $9,000, so you had about $14 Million a day of new Bitcoins being produced! So for the price to hold around that level, we had to have $14 Million of new demand a day. Now, there\u2019s only so much more the demand can increase! There will come a point in which the demand goes up, and so the price goes up, and then the price of the new coins that\u2019ll be mined is also going up massively, so then the new supply becomes bigger than the demand \u2014 the demand can\u2019t keep up with the supply, and you witness an inflection because there\u2019s also a lot of leverage! A lot of people that are leveraged in so they get wiped out and then the technicals of the chart turn, and then we can have another big drawdown! What do you think?"}
{"link": "https://saifedean.com/podcast/34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standard/", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #34. Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [1:45:30]: I\u2019m not really a big believer in the halvings as being a driver going forward! Again I think that all of these models are mental models that were formed in the early years, and I think that you should throw them all out! And you should start to reason from first principles and build a new model! For example: I\u2019m staring at the screen of Binance right now! The 24-hour volume of BTC is 93,000 coins on Binance. If you double it, that means there\u2019s probably 180,000 coins traded today! 900 Bitcoin is irrelevant! The amount of Bitcoin being created is so de minimis compared to the volume of the trading, it\u2019s irrelevant! And also, I think it\u2019s irrelevant to any rational investor! It\u2019s just irrelevant to me! For example: there\u2019s 21 Million fully-diluted Bitcoins! Done! End of Story! Like, I don\u2019t care at what point they get printed because \u2014 again, what\u2019s the ratio of 93,000 to 900? The amount of Bitcoin getting mined is 50 basis points! It\u2019s half of a percent! Like when we\u2019re doing a trade, we pay half a percent as the fee! Like, people with serious amounts of money \u2014 they\u2019re gonna blow through this! They don\u2019t care! What matters a lot more than all of these concerns about the halving is if Paul Tudor Jones wakes up and decides to double his allocation from 1% to 2%? Or from 2% to 4%? That matters more than all of these other things, because the demand is excessive! So I think a better way to look at it is, it\u2019s emerging as an asset class like the S&P 500 index. And when it gets to be $10 Trillion or $5 Trillion or $3 Trillion just like the index, there\u2019s so much money coming in and going out of it that it\u2019s stabilizing the index, and it takes \u2014 if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class like gold, it would take a Trillion dollars! Why do you think I didn\u2019t buy gold? It\u2019s because I said, Well it\u2019s gonna take $20 Trillion to drive gold up by a factor of 10! How much does it really take, right? If you have a Trillion dollar asset class, then a Trillion dollars will probably drive it up by a factor of 10. Like if you double the demand? Maybe more! But if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class, a Trillion dollars drives it up by a factor of 2, maybe, or 50%. So as it gets more monetary energy, the inertial component gets greater, the liquidity gets greater! I really think for institutional investors, the halving just doesn\u2019t matter anymore! The dynamic that matters is \u2014 another example: if Dan Schulman wakes up tomorrow and says, I think I should put Bitcoin on PayPal\u2019s balance sheet! Dan Schulman has a $300 Billion company! He could put $10 Billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet! When Coinbase becomes public, they might be worth $100 Billion! If the CEO of Coinbase decides to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet, he could put a Billion on the balance sheet! $2\u20133 Billion! The decisions of individuals! Ray Dalio is giving a speech at ConsenSys. Ray Dalio\u2019s got $150 Billion of assets under management. If he decides that Bitcoin is 25% as good as gold, won\u2019t they buy like $10 Billion of it? Ray Dalio, Brian Armstrong, Dan Shulman, right? Individuals! There\u2019s probably 10,000 people in the world that have the ability to put a Billion dollars on the network! 10,000! And there\u2019s 1,000\u20132,000 that have the ability to put $10 Billion on the network! Again, every model that you have and all the history that we have is all irrelevant if any of them act! The actors, the actions that get taken place obsolesce and they overwhelm any statistical models, because the statistical models are based upon \u2014 like if you told me \u2014 for example, in 2018 you have a bunch of Bitcoin and crypto traders that are trading with leverage that have no banks, they can\u2019t borrow money against their Bitcoin, okay? Those people have a very short time preference, Saifedean! You\u2019re the time guy, right? The people that have the shortest time preference I\u2019ve found are crypto traders! I mean, they\u2019re thinking about whether or not it\u2019s trading down in the next 8 hours, right? So when I ask people, Why don\u2019t you put 100% of your assets into Bitcoin they say, Well I need money to live on! Well why don\u2019t you just borrow money? Who\u2019s gonna loan me money? BlockFi! Oh BlockFi, they charge 12%, 10%, right? So there\u2019s a very embryonic industry right now\u2014the consumer banking industry that\u2019s banking Bitcoin. By the way: name 5 companies that\u2019ll give you $100 Million loan against Bitcoin? Name 5. Can you? No! No! It\u2019s embryonic! I can name 5 that\u2019ll give me a $100 Million loan against Apple stock! Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley \u2014 everybody! Okay? And here\u2019s my point: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to change! What\u2019s changing is the banks! The banks are changing! NYDIG will give you a loan! Genesis will give you a loan! When Coinbase will give you a loan \u2014 Binance is rolling out some credit products. PayPal won\u2019t give you a loan yet, but what happens when PayPal gives 340 Million people a loan at 4% interest against Bitcoin? What happens to Bitcoin? Well, time horizons stretch out! Now I can own it for 30 years. Oh you mean I don\u2019t have to sell my Bitcoin to buy my Lamborghini? If you actually believe Bitcoin\u2019s going up by a factor of 2 every 2 years you\u2019re an idiot to sell your Bitcoin to buy your Lamborghini! The Lamborghini\u2019s gonna cost you $100 Million! Why don\u2019t you borrow the money to buy the Lamborghini and keep the Bitcoin? Well I\u2019m afraid! I\u2019m afraid of what? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna crash down by 80%. Why? Well because it did once before! Okay? So you see this circular reasoning which is: I lived in a world of crypto traders on leverage with no banking with no institutional support, and so I act. It\u2019s just like your time preference: I\u2019m afraid to plan for the future because I don\u2019t trust the money! A lot of people in their head, they think Bitcoin is volatile, I don\u2019t trust it, I won\u2019t be able to borrow against it! And that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy! There\u2019s only a certain amount of \u2014 rate\u2014at which you can change people\u2019s perceptions, right? It takes 3, 4, 5, 6 years! As the HODLers discover that they can borrow money against Bitcoin, and as the institutions come in \u2014 by the way, what\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019s famous quote? We find a company we like, our preferred holding period is forever! Is Warren Buffett still owning Coca-Cola stock? Yes! Did he sell it to buy a Lamborghini? No! Did he need to? No! Why? Because he could\u2019ve borrowed against it! Yeah! What\u2019s the impact on Coke stock? It\u2019s not so volatile! Right? Because he\u2019s a HODLer! So this is not an uncommon idea! So institutions that hold gold, how long have they been holding gold? Like, forever! What happens if you replace gold with digital gold? You hold it for 50 years! By the way, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be able to buy Bitcoin! Bitcoin below $20,000 \u2014 gone forever! Bitcoin below $30,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin below $40,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin in the $40,000\u201350,000 range? Who do you think is selling this stuff? The weak hands, with high leverage, are selling. Who do you think is buying it? Institutions! That have more money than God! That have 1,000x as much money as they\u2019re buying with this stuff. And which ones? The first 1%, just the early vanguard. So as this happens, the institutions take ownership, their time horizon is a decade. The banks come online, that means we never need to sell it ever! I mean all these guys on crypto Twitter go, Well what are you gonna do if you ever need money? And the answer is: I\u2019m never gonna need money! Right? Institutions never need money! If I ever wanted a little bit of cash, I could just borrow a little bit, but the truth of the matter is, the people buying this stuff are endowments! Harvard endowment, Yale endowment, right? So it\u2019s a different set of holders, it\u2019s a different banking relationship, it\u2019s gonna be more diffuse. As it\u2019s more diffuse, the volatility falls! You\u2019re gonna have the stories of Ruffer, Saifedean! Ruffer bought $750 Million of Bitcoin below $20,000 when it traded at $40,000 they took half off the table, so they took a $750 Million profit. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t trade up beyond $40,000! So then it traded down to $31,000. They might have bought back in, Saif! Those guys, the big institutions, they\u2019re going to be damping it on the upside, on the downside, and collaring it. And this will continue for a while! So it\u2019s a different dynamic because of the players and the capital and the banks and the security, and it\u2019s going to continue to evolve and the risk profile and the perceptions will evolve!"}

That\u2019s what I get \u2014 900 coins a day times $48,000? You guys can check it. That gives me $43 Million a day. See? It\u2019s not even like a percent, it\u2019s like a fraction of a percent! It\u2019s 25 basis points right now? And my point again is: it\u2019s 25 basis points \u2014 what\u2019s the most profitable investment you can hold on your treasury? Bitcoin, right? Tell me a miner that doesn\u2019t believe in Bitcoin? The stupidest thing you can do is sell your Bitcoin! Don\u2019t sell your Bitcoin! Okay? So, what\u2019s gonna happen? I actually think you\u2019re gonna see the polarity flip on this! I think that as miners become public like Riot and Marathon, I think they\u2019re gonna think about it and they\u2019re gonna realize they should just keep mining but stop selling! Have you looked at Marathon\u2019s stock? It his $40 today! It more than doubled since they bought Bitcoin on their balance sheet, Saif \u2014 in two weeks! You know what the market\u2019s telling you? The market\u2019s telling you that pretty much they will finance you with a premium to hold the Bitcoin, because they like the Bitcoin! So what that means is that in theory, a publicly traded mining company can raise unlimited equity or debt and never sell!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [2:00:07]: So it\u2019s not that big a deal now, but the point really is: there are other dynamics here and they could flip the polarity! What happens if $10 Billion comes from the public markets into the Bitcoin market because these miners \u2014 I think Marathon\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap, Riot\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap \u2014 what happens if they double and they issue debt or issue equity? My point is: all your models are destroyed! Humility here is \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people here that can tip the apple cart here! So if you construct this model based upon the past, you\u2019re dismissing the actions of rational actors! It\u2019s rational for a miner to buy Bitcoin, not sell Bitcoin! It\u2019s rational for a miner to go public! It\u2019s rational for Square or PayPal to buy more Bitcoin! They might not, by the way! It\u2019s irrational not to! They might not because of volatility. How do you convince your customers to buy Bitcoin with your app when you\u2019re afraid to buy it on your balance sheet, right? Isn\u2019t there a little bit of a marketing hazard there? So there\u2019s rational actors with capital that can move this Bitcoin and they can change the volatility and they can drive it very very hard. And the only thing that keeps them from doing it is getting up in the morning and deciding they\u2019ll take a risk! If you basically bet that nobody will act rationally and nobody will take a risk, then you can run your historical models! But if I can break your model \u2014 if I break your model with action \u2014 then you probably ought to have a more open-ended view of the world, a different model! I look at it and I say, Everybody on Earth with money should buy this stuff and all 7.8 Billion people need it and it\u2019s only distributed to 0.1% of the market \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with this picture? At some point, someone is gonna decide to do the rational thing! Arguably they\u2019re doing it now! If price is going up 300% a year, that seems to me to be rational risk-takers acting about as fast as they can reasonably act! Without, you know, going through the sound barrier! Going through the sound barrier \u2014 there\u2019s a shock wave, and you rip the wings off the airplane! We\u2019re kind of pushing up against the sound barrier \u2014 the rate at which \u2014 what\u2019s the fastest an asset class can take on monetary energy without burning itself up! This might be close to the fastest! Because it\u2019s accelerating, isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t seen the numbers \u2014 someone should calculate the annualized yield, but I thought it was 230% RoR something, over the last 5\u201310 years."}

So yeah we were due for a very fast year this year anyway. Now look, as an Austrian economist I\u2019m always exactly on the same page with you on that fact that it is the actions of humans that determines economic outcomes and not statistical models and constructs! But, this year we\u2019ve been fascinated a little bit with the Stock to Flow model and it drives me to think that there might be something mechanical about the way that the difficulty adjustment and the mining determine how the price moves, just because there\u2019s a limit over how much the price can go up over time!"}

You know, Zimbabwe inflation rates are different than the US and the US is radically different than a year ago! So I think you gotta take into account monetary policy and I think you gotta take into account technology! Stock to flow doesn\u2019t take into account what happens if Tim Cook decides to build Bitcoin into the Apple Watch and into the Apple Phone? Those actions in technology, they have an impact, and doing it sooner rather than later will do it! And I know for a fact there are 10 people in the world \u2014 all they would have to do is put out a press release and they would move the price of Bitcoin! And so the technology adoption and the monetary policy \u2014 all those things, they have a massive impact on what happens, yet they\u2019re not really part of the stock to flow!"}

But I mean\u2014and rationally, this is why you would expect the model to break down, and yet it doesn\u2019t! And that is really the mind-blowing thing as far as I\u2019m concerned! And I think \u2014 it might sound funny to say it \u2014 but the model would\u2019ve expected a big squeeze after the halving! And so you know, that\u2019s needed \u2014 people like you and MassMutual to show up and carry the banner after we\u2019ve done the light lifting \u2014 you guys do the heavy lifting taking us to $100k! And I think, yeah! 2025 is when you would expect people like Apple to be building their entire company around something like Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s a little maybe too early for them to start now but I think maybe by 2025 they\u2019ll be sold and they\u2019ll be convinced and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take us further! So the trend undeniably is Number Go Up! But what the model shows is that that number going up happens in spurts after the halving and then there\u2019s a bit of a come down and consolidation after it, that it follows this market pattern. So it seems to be holding up now, and that for me \u2014 and it\u2019s really sacrilegious as an Austrian economist to be saying this \u2014 but it suggests that maybe there is something about the way that the network works that is forcing this! And in fact, if you read Mises, what Mises says is, The reason you can\u2019t perform economic calculation and make scientific predictions in economics, is that economics does not have a constant. There is no constant in economics. In physics, in chemistry, in math, in all those things\u2014well not in math \u2014 you go back to a physical constant that is personally determined and easy to assert them and all of them go back to constants of nature, eventually. So based on that you\u2019re able to make scientific relationships and devise them. And it seems to me that \u2014 maybe\u2014the stock to flow model is showing us the ability to form calculations with human action for the first time with this kind of accuracy, maybe 21 Million is economics\u2019 first constant!"}

I think we\u2019ll see an inversion, it\u2019s possible that all the Bitcoin miners become public and they stop selling any Bitcoin, and they become banks of their own, they start issuing equity and debt to finance the market, and you could actually see a reverse polarity there! As Bitcoin crashes into institutions that are publicly financeable, I think the dynamic changes quite a lot, because they have different options to access liquidity! So it\u2019s a different network when it\u2019s individuals that are unbanked that are in the cash business, than it is when it\u2019s institutions that are very very well-banked and well-financed! I think the network moving toward the point where it\u2019s just all transaction-based, and I think the transaction block size \u2014 those will get larger and transaction fees will go up and the network will settle into some equilibrium there as well."}

If you look at the typical person, everybody owns a set of things: their house, their car, their boat, their trophy assets that they\u2019re gonna keep, and those will have monetary value imbued in them. Those are the goods and products and whatever. And then there\u2019s another chunk which is just the treasury \u2014 everybody\u2019s got a natural treasury. And that\u2019s capital saved up for the future against uncertainty! I think it\u2019s natural that Bitcoin will just continually absorb that treasury energy from endowments, from corporations, from individuals, and my estimate is that it feels like it\u2019s about half! Half of everything should be treasury and the other half is tangible property! You can estimate it by counting the volume of gold and the total amount in sovereign debt: half of sovereign debt\u2014maybe you want to give a loan to your government because you love the government, but my experience is that 90% of the money invested in sovereign debt wasn\u2019t because we loved the government, it was just a store of value! And if you look at the S&P I think people invested in the S&P because they just didn\u2019t have confidence in their ability to pick stocks \u2014 they wanted a store of value! So I think if you added up all the store of value asset classes, you\u2019ll probably find yourself getting to a $200 Trillion number, plus or minus, against $400\u2013500 Trillion \u2014 it depends on how you calculate it! So you kind of conclude it\u2019s like 40\u201350%. And it\u2019s kind of common sense, right? Half of your money is, you want to save as fungible asset, and the other half you invest in things you love or things you believe in or you take risks on companies or the like. I think that was pretty obvious back in the day when savings accounts existed, it\u2019s just that savings accounts have been destroyed and so now people are saving in the stock market!"}

So long before I discovered Bitcoin I was a Paleo enthusiast and I think that a lot of stuff that comes out of thinking about how Paleolithic man lived for 3 Million years, I think is really useful health advice! What did your forebearers eat, and how did they live 100,000 years ago I think is helpful! It\u2019s helpful in your fitness routines and your eating routines. I think that 100,000\u2013200,000 years ago people ate lean proteins and they ate low-sugar content \u2014 maybe nuts. They didn\u2019t eat sugar-laden fruits and they probably didn\u2019t eat highly-engineered modern food, they certainly didn\u2019t eat any processed food. So my view is, I am pretty much carnivore! I eat a lot of steak, I eat a lot of chicken and fish, but I think that vegetables and nuts are okay! I think the keto diet is a pretty good diet. I understand the Salisbury Diet, I think that in the event that you have auto-immune diseases or inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s very effective, and so I can imagine living off of all meat, but I think it\u2019s equally reasonable \u2014 if you\u2019re coming up with a theory of health, I think if you start with the question: how did human beings live for 3 Million years before the modern agricultural age? And you model your lifestyle based upon that, I think that\u2019s consistent with the healthiest lifestyle, and your conclusions are: you\u2019re probably not gonna drink orange juice, you\u2019re not gonna drink cartons of vodka, you\u2019re not gonna consume processed foods, you\u2019re not gonna sit in a chair all day long, you\u2019re not gonna be afraid to be out in the sun all day long, you should probably do vigorous activity, and you should probably eat lean, healthy proteins!"}

Welcome back to Episode 3 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show here in the Saylor Series! So we\u2019ve covered with Michael Saylor so far the rise of Man through the Stone Ages through the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we saw how mankind can have a misstep that causes him to regress 1,000 years, and up into the Steel and Industrial Age. And today we\u2019re gonna go even further into the future, and the arc of all this is we\u2019re seeing how mankind does take these evolutionary steps forward in terms of both his morality and the tools that he conducts his life with. And we see, as Michael says, that natural selection through this process, helps mankind become smarter, faster, stronger. And we\u2019re coming to see that the defensive attributes of technology tend to be more important than offensive attributes over time. This is just leading us deeper into and closer to Bitcoin, which as we\u2019ll talk about later, is the ultimate monetary defensive technology! And in that sense, humans \u2014 the reason we\u2019re able to progress in this way and the reason we\u2019re different than any other animal \u2014 is because we are actually capable of harnessing and channeling energy across these field lines of our intellect. So we can form these abstract concepts and ideas and then actually energize them by harnessing energy in the natural world. And that\u2019s why in a geopolitical sense, naval power has been the force that governs the world. He who dominates the sea dominates the world! And in that context we\u2019re looking now as we progress into the digital age, as digital space being this new high seas, if you will. So in this episode we\u2019re gonna get into a lot of that and we\u2019re also gonna finish off by talking about an area that Mr. Saylor is an expert in, which is the history of scientific revolutions. And we\u2019re gonna talk about in particular the technology diffusion S-curve, which is when a new idea starts to permeate a society, it starts out relatively slowly, toward this inflection point and becomes rapidly adopted at an accelerating pace, before finally hitting a point of full market penetration, it starts to level out. And this will be important to comprehend in terms of not only all the innovations we\u2019ve seen recently \u2014 especially the Internet \u2014 but also the path that we\u2019d expect Bitcoin to continue to follow. Finally we\u2019ll touch on war. And how it is an accelerant to innovation. And how it can accelerate us down that path of technology S-curve and leaves us eventually with technologies that would be perceived as miracles to primitive man. As Michael will say later, Sufficiently advanced technologies are indistinguishable from magic! So I hope you\u2019re pumped! We\u2019re still building this big foundation getting into modernity, and this will be one of the final episodes that gets us there! So with that, let\u2019s get into it with Episode 3!"}

If you want a great vignette on why it\u2019s important to have capital that\u2019s mobile, study or just read any history of the Warburgs and what their family went through, and what all the Jewish families went through in the 30\u2019s in Germany. And what the bankers had to do to move capital out of the country, and you get a very poignant punctuated appreciation for the need of having secure capital that you control! So there\u2019s some, I think, general themes of technology throughout history, if you look across all of these. The general theme is: human beings marching toward being harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And everyone that\u2019s succeeded \u2014 every empire, individual, company \u2014 they all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger. George R.R. Martin, he wrote a bunch of books \u2014 he\u2019s known for Game of Thrones, but he also wrote a bunch of books on superheroes, or at least he called them wildcards. And it\u2019s about a bunch of superheroes or super-people that have genetic mutations, and they get it from some virus, and it\u2019s a universe full of normal people, and then jokers \u2014 people who have been hideously deformed by this virus, and then aces \u2014 people that have been given superpower. And he takes a very modern view of it, and he starts to analyze superpowers: a guy figures out he can shoot laser beams out of his hands, another woman can be invisible, or some dude can be a thin man! And he goes, There a lot of these superheroes, but after a while we quickly realized that the most powerful ones were the ones with defensive superpowers. Defensive attributes overcome all of the offensive attributes in a battle! So for example, the guy that\u2019s indestructible with no other superpower, can pick up a machine gun and kill everybody! And you can shoot him a million times, but he\u2019s indestructible! Whereas, the guy with the laser beams jumping out of his hands, he\u2019s just as mortal as you and me! And you hit him with one rock\u2014he goes down and he\u2019s dead! So it\u2019s the impossible-to-kill ones that end up winning all the battles between superheroes in the smackdown, and the ones with the sexy things, or sexy, really cool superpowers \u2014 they\u2019re useless! Because the guy that\u2019s got none of those \u2014 he just gets a bazooka and he just fires! Or he\u2019s like, I\u2019m indestructible so I\u2019m gonna set off an atomic bomb in the city and kill everybody but myself because I\u2019m indestructible! It\u2019s pretty easy to win the war if you\u2019re indestructible. And it causes you to come to a conclusion about history and who wins in history: unbreakable is better, antifragile is best! So the superhero that\u2019s good is the one that you hit him and you can\u2019t hurt him! But the superheroes that are most frightening are the ones where you shoot him with a laser beam and now they can shoot your laser beams back at you! And you mind-read them and they absorb your mind-reading and they can mind-read you! And you fly at the speed at the sound and now they can fly at the speed of sound! [11:05] Like that character, what is it \u2014"}

Maybe Rogue! It\u2019s the one that absorbs your power and plays it back at you! You know, pretty soon it\u2019s like, I am indestructible and I have every other power and you just better get out of the way! And that\u2019s antifragile, right? I\u2019m looking for the fight! I\u2019m looking for people because I\u2019m just gonna absorb their thing! So you see that theme through history: the really successful governments, empires, organizations, they\u2019re continually fighting, they\u2019re continually absorbing \u2014 the Romans absorbed the Carthaginian\u2019s navy in 90 days! It\u2019s easier said than done! It wasn\u2019t like some Roman politician said, These are Carthaginian ships \u2014 they\u2019re inferior to us. We will invent our own ships! It\u2019s like, Not too proud to copy, not too proud to absorb it! This kind of principle can explain the success the United States in the wars of the last century or more. Why did we win World War I, World War II? Why is America America? Well there\u2019s two narratives. Millionaires. One is: because we\u2019re more patriotic and we\u2019re righteous and we\u2019re better! The other one is: the Europeans were fighting in Europe and we were fighting in Europe! So we were fighting, they were soft! When you\u2019re dropping bombs in the middle of suburban Germany, you\u2019re attacking the soft underbelly of the citizens in Germany, or the soft underbelly of the citizens in France, or the Battle of Britain. This is the citizen population being ravaged by a war. And that destroyed their economies, right? Destroyed their culture! Same happened in Russia, Italy. It\u2019s happened in China, and the Chinese fought a war in China\u2019s soil. The Japanese fought sort of a portion of a war on their own soil with the atomic warheads. On the other and, the US hadn\u2019t fought a war on US soil since 1865. Okay? So who\u2019s hard? Back to this missile idea, right? If you can throw a missile 3,000 miles and your enemy can throw a missile back 300 miles back at you \u2014 it\u2019s pretty simple: I have a rifle, you have a pistol! I stand back 1,000 feet \u2014 your pistol\u2019s good for 200 feet! I take 100 shots, eventually 1 hits \u2014 you\u2019re a perfect shot, it doesn\u2019t matter! Longer arms! So this idea: art you unbreakable? Or back to terrain: what is the terrain? The geography determines a lot of things! If you take a modern ship: take a modern yacht built in the year 2020, with every piece of modern equipment on it. Now try to sail it to Afghanistan! You probably won\u2019t get there! Something will probably break! Try to sail it to Rome without stopping in a port along the way. You probably won\u2019t make it! Robert, nobody does! They all stop and hide somewhere! It\u2019s really hard to move stuff over the ocean thousands of miles! It\u2019s really hard! Now, why don\u2019t you try to sail an armada of 1,000 ships 3,000 miles in order to invade America? Germans couldn\u2019t sail 13 miles across the Straits of Dover! The Japanese couldn\u2019t cross from Japan to China during the kamikaze, and that\u2019s not very far! It\u2019s really hard! There\u2019s only one guy that ever pulled it off\u2014William the Conqueror in 1066! Nobody else managed to cross 13 miles. That\u2019s your hydraulic moat! It\u2019s really hard! It explains the culture of the U.K. It explains the culture of the United States. It explains a lot of other culture. It explains the balance of power, I think! If you just say, Here\u2019s someone that you couldn\u2019t kill who could kill you! I had the option to fight on your turf, but you would never have the option to fight on my turf. Now, that in and of its way is the reason that security is so incredibly important to the Bitcoin network! What is important is that it not break! If I\u2019m indestructible, I don\u2019t have to be the fastest, the shiniest, the whatever anything! I just have to be indestructible! If I\u2019m indestructible \u2014 the indestructible man goes and buys a machine gun and he\u2019s the most powerful superhero in the room, right? The indestructible blockchain goes and buys a digital app, or another crypto network, an off-chain app, or a Lightning, or a Binance, or a Coinbase, or a Square Cash or whatever, and it\u2019s just fine! It\u2019s the most powerful network in the room! [17:29] Because the thing that made it the winner was its indestructibility, its immortality! Not the fact that it could shoot laser beams from its fingers, or it was beautiful, or it could fly with its pretty wings, or it was invisible. All of these other things? Privacy, transactions \u2014 all these other things, they\u2019re interesting, but they pale compared to the characteristic of immortality! Being indestructible in the here and now \u2014 pretty useful superhero power! Being indestructible and never aging \u2014 double useful superpower! And as for the rest, if you\u2019re an open software protocol, someone\u2019s gonna code an extension to your protocol to give you every other cool power that anybody wants! I can find a way to construct every other superpower by hook or crook, and that makes me antifragile and now I\u2019m like the frightening impossible-to-stop superhero!"}

Who gives a shit if you\u2019ve got 18 outstanding \u2014 whatever! Just tell me the fully diluted number! And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is, right? It\u2019s like, you know that it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s only\u20143 Million have been lost, or 18 Million and a half mined so far and 3 and a half to go \u2014 all that really matters is that fully diluted figure of 21 Million! And that the scarcity cannot be compromised, and then that it has enough antifragility on top of that to absorb other market-proven features \u2014 that\u2019s all you want in money!"}

The mining rate, it\u2019s like a secondary particular effect that happens in the first few years of its evolution, but exponentially it becomes irrelevant. It\u2019s a second order driver. The first order driver is, [Is] the hardness infinitely hard? And then adoption and utility and inflation in the fiat reference frame that it\u2019s operating in. A couple more points that are worth making on technology and human history. Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. All of these things come down to: how did I channel energy? So, navy power. The British Navy ruled the sea, the Phoenicians, the Venetians, the Greeks, the Romans. The Americans today control the seas via their aircraft carriers and via naval power. And naval power is just bringing overwhelming stronger force to bear that\u2019s faster, that\u2019s harder, than any other force anywhere on Earth. I park an aircraft carrier somewhere and death rains from above! So we\u2019ve seen all empires are driven by a naval power. In time, we invented airplanes. And then air power became the thing! And air power is again all about death from above: the most powerful navy idea is airplanes flying off an aircraft carrier! First it was the battleship by: show up in your harbor \u2014 I blast everything. Then it became air power. And if I could get above you \u2014 and we saw this in [inaudible 21:56] \u2014 it is impossible for a modern nation state to function if it does not control its own air space. You saw that in the First Gulf War, the Second Gulf War. The United States, especially the United States air force, could pretty much bomb any country back to the Stone Age in a matter of a week, once you lose your air supremacy, once you lose control of your air space. There\u2019s no hope for you! You can take out every port, every power reactor, every generator, every serious building, they\u2019re all gone. Death from above! There\u2019s nothing you can do! You\u2019re at the bottom of the gravity well. And with technology today, someone can sit out 6 miles up \u2014 you can\u2019t shoot down a plane moving at high speeds 6 miles up! You have to fight the gravity well to get there! They\u2019re just working opposite: it\u2019s an energy thing, right? So I\u2019m moving from a lower energy state\u2014I\u2019m on the ground moving enemies around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I have a boat, I\u2019m moving heavy masses around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I\u2019m above you dropping munitions on you. Then after that, it became nuclear power! You harness nuclear power and that ended World War II pretty definitively in a hurry. Then we go to space satellite power! And then you go up the gravity well some more, and that manifests itself primarily with GPS. If you look at the impact of having a Global Positioning Satellite, that\u2019s what allows me to drop a laser-guided bomb or a drone anywhere on Earth and guide it day or night to anything! And that\u2019s a massive source of American supremacy \u2014 controlling those GPS satellites! And you lose them \u2014 big problem, too! [23:53] One of my favorite books, and I note it, is The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. And in it, Robert Heinlein, he writes about a bunch of Loonies\u2014basically Libertarians that live on the moon that believe in making their own way, and their motto is, There ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch! Abbreviated to TANSTAAFL, and he introduced that idea, and he introduced that idea. And they take it to the extreme, which is like, You\u2019re air\u2019s not even free on the moon\u2014you pay for everything! You pay for water, you pay for food, you pay for air. Everybody pulls their own weight. No one waits for a bail-out. There\u2019s no bail-out coming from anybody. And they\u2019re not big fans of authority. They don\u2019t like being told what to do! And the plot of the book winds on that they\u2019re being oppressed by Earthlings who are making them work as slaves and they\u2019re taking 90% of their economic productivity and shipping back basically their future to Earth and they\u2019re gradually suffocating and starving them to death. It\u2019s just onerous. Taxation without representation! But onerous. So the Loonies decide to fight back with the help of an A.I. computer. The first A.I. computer I can remember! The name of the computer is Mike, by the way! And their technique is they realize that they\u2019ve gotta catapult, and they start tossing rocks down the gravity well, and they just take a big rock, put it in their catapult, and it doesn\u2019t take that much force to toss it off the moon because they\u2019re low-G, they\u2019re tossing the rock out of a 1/8th G or whatever, and it hits the Earth, goes into a trajectory, and of course this starts picking up speed! And by the time it lands, it\u2019s like an atomic warhead. They just start tossing \u2019em at random places until the Federation Empire that\u2019s oppressing them decides that maybe it\u2019s had enough! And of course the lesson is: it\u2019s humans channeling energy, but they\u2019re channeling gravitational energy \u2014 and a lot of it! And there\u2019s a lot more energy than the stuff that we have! All through human history \u2014 since a million years ago to today \u2014 it\u2019s really the story of intelligent people looking around for, Where is the energy coming from? And how do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?"}

They predicted the rise of what they called narrowcasting, as opposed to broadcasting, which we would call social media today. They predicted the rise of anonymous digital cash which would be disruptive to the nation state, which we would think Bitcoin is. And it also predicted the digitization of securities, so other property rights going away from a government function to be provided via software. And one of the things that was interesting there is that they compared digital space to the high seas. Basically saying, The reason why whoever controls the high seas controls the world is because that\u2019s the most frictionless environment! You can move things with the least energy on the seas, once you can conquer them. So whoever controls that domain sort of controls the world. But also \u2014 because it\u2019s frictionless \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to project dominion over the high seas. So we don\u2019t have law, really \u2014 we have international waters everywhere in the world! And they compare that and analogize it to digital space, where it\u2019s a frictionless space that whoever is dominant there will be dominant in the 21st century, but it will also be very difficult to project dominion. So it will be unregulated, largely! So they\u2019re using that to kind of make the case for digital cash, and the fact that people would be able to escape oppressive regimes. Once you get your capital in the digital space, you\u2019re no longer under the thumb of the government of the local oppressive monopoly. So I just think it\u2019s interesting how it just always comes down to the terrain, right?"}

Probably the key thing there is: technology is empowering the individual and giving them more sovereignty. And it\u2019s harder and harder in those ways for the government to control what information you get, and then how you manage your assets. But it\u2019s a very twisty, complicated subject, because the government\u2019s getting more power over you in some areas, they get less power over you in other areas, and it\u2019s spinning fast!"}

So it seems to be that \u2014 and it\u2019s complicated because we\u2019ve never seen a world like that, right?

It seems like it gets harder for any one government to assert control over the things that take place virtually. So there\u2019s a lot of virtual empowerment going on, but there\u2019s a lot of other things going on too! I guess I would end this section with just a couple of dynamics that I think I\u2019ve seen over and over again with technology. When I was at MIT I studied the history of science and I read about the structure of scientific revolutions and I studied all different types of technology diffusions. And there\u2019s certain things that pop out. A lot of times you\u2019ll see an S-curve where it\u2019ll start slow and it\u2019ll accelerate until it reaches diminishing returns, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not an interesting technology anymore! You see that a lot! But, one of the lessons of history is: it\u2019s very difficult to figure out when the curve starts, and it\u2019s hard to stop it once it starts, but it\u2019s a lot easier to invest in it and to forecast it once it starts. But before it starts, people will say, Well next year this will commercialize\u2014or in 2, 5, 10 years. You could be off by 2 years, you could be off by 100 years! You remember Google Glass? How big that was gonna be? And how that was a lead balloon, and how many years is it after Google Glass and it\u2019s still not gonna happen next year either! Technology fails until it succeeds \u2014 that\u2019s another trend and another theme. So you see over and over again people pick at technologists and they\u2019ll say, Oh it\u2019ll never work! It\u2019ll never work! It\u2019ll never work! In the year 1902, before the Wright brothers flew that next year, if you\u2019d asked the most learned people on Earth, they would\u2019ve given you 100 reasons why airplanes will fly, and they would give you 100 examples of how they didn\u2019t fly, and they would talk you to death. And the thing about these paradigm shifts is, oftentimes it\u2019s not the learned individuals that make the breakthrough! Aircraft weren\u2019t designed by professors of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering and fluid dynamics and mathematicians \u2014 they all failed miserably! The Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics! They had a bicycle shop \u2014 tinkerers! They\u2019re the ones that ushered in the age! And they did it against all conventional wisdom! And on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci tried to develop his own flying contraption! Every brilliant person for hundreds of years tried it \u2014 failed! All failed! And then some dudes in Dayton, Ohio that have a bicycle shop succeed. It happens like that! The story of John Harrison inventing, discovering a method to determine longitude on the ocean \u2014 it\u2019s articulated in the book, Longitude, it\u2019s an amazing story! Everybody knew how to find lattitude, it was easy, it was just like, against the North Star. But longitude\u2019s very hard because the Earth\u2019s spinning all the time and it required massively complicated calculations! They gave it to Newtonian professors at Cambridge and Oxford \u2014 the smartest mathematicians and astronomers in the world \u2014 no one could figure it out! Finally they posted a \u00a310,000 prize and John Harrison\u2014who was not a mathematician, he\u2019s a clockmaker \u2014figured it out! And the way he figured it out is he made a clock that was accurate, and they put one clock on the ship, and they set it to the Greenwich Observatory, the royal observatory, which is in Greenwich, England. Hence the term, Greenwich Mean Time. Greenwich Mean Time comes because you sail down the Thames past the royal observatory in Greenwich, you set your clock on that, and then you have another clock, and then every day at noon \u2014 if you\u2019re in the Caribbean you look up and then you set that clock \u2014 and then you just subtract the time on the one from the time from the other, multiply it by 15 degrees and you\u2019ve got your longitude! It was a tinkerer\u2019s solution to a problem everybody else wanted to solve with star charts and tables and complex math! But of course, ships\u2019 captains in the middle of the Caribbean or in a storm, they can\u2019t do complex math! They just wanna stay alive! So you see lots of examples in history where people try to do something and they either accidentally discover it like Penicillin, or a tinkerer discovers it, and not the educated \u2014 and then all the professors crap all over it, and they all swear it\u2019ll never work! And the tendency is either to reject it \u2014 people don\u2019t like change \u2014 or it doesn\u2019t get embraced until everybody dies, or until there\u2019s a war! And war has a way of opening your mind because when someone drops a bomb on your head and you\u2019re burning or screaming, then the pain causes you to take a more open-minded attitude! So a lot of stuff happened after World War II and happens in various wars, and you can trace it through human history! That drives innovation faster! Generational change will drive it faster. People keep trying it, and then just because it\u2019s failed 1,000 times doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t succeed, but when it does succeed, then it\u2019s probably unstoppable for a while! And hence, yeah you just get to this phrase, which is kind of punctuation for modern technology: Arthur C. Clark writes, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And it was a great quote, it\u2019s a quote that I put on the back of my prospectus when my company became public in \u201998. I believed it then \u2014 we have thousands and thousands of examples of magic things in our lives today! Literally magic things, that are just technical things! It\u2019s always been that way, and to a primitive man, a rifle looks magical! Or an airplane! And now, we\u2019re starting to deal with some software technologies and digital technologies that don\u2019t just look magical to a primitive man, they\u2019re gonna look magical to a modern man! Because they just really are getting pretty magical!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-3-rmYfQeNPqgu/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 3 | Technology Themes through History \u2014 Harder, Smarter, Faster, Stronger", "text": "Robert Breedlove [39:20]: Alright guys! So that was Episode 3 of the Saylor Series. I hope you enjoyed that! We continue our progress towards modernity, and laying this really solid intellectual foundation through the lens of technology, anthropology, civilizational development, military \u2014 all of these aspects that lead us to the importance of Bitcoin as money! And as I said in the intro, I like to think of this whole arc as an evolutionary process. I actually consider that evolution is the inorganic form of innovation, or you could say that innovation is the organic form of evolution. So they\u2019re both about colliding ideas together and with reality, to test which ideas, strategies, and approaches work best. Which offer the highest utility to the organism or human being that\u2019s set an intention and an aim. It\u2019s through this iterative process\u2014as Saylor says it makes us harder, faster, and stronger. And I think what\u2019s starting to shape up here as I think you\u2019ll see is that the defensive attributes tend to be even more important than offensive attributes. So if you have an ability to defend yourself say behind a wall of water \u2014 you\u2019re in the United States, we\u2019re defended on both sides by large walls of water in the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, we have this natural defensive advantage! So it\u2019s really difficult to invade us without having long-ranging weapons when we dominate the naval territory already. We are the dominant naval force because of our access to the oceans and our protection from hostile powers. And I liked the analogy that Saylor gave when he talked about the George R.R. Martin superheroes \u2014 I think they were called the Aces. It wasn\u2019t the superhero with the best offensive capability \u2014 the laser beams out of the eyes or whatever \u2014 that became dominant, it was actually the one that was indestructible! Because he could essentially subject himself to any situation and survive! Which reminded me of that saying which I think is from Sun Tzu \u2014 it might be from Lao Tzu \u2014 If you wait long enough by the river, you live to see the bodies of your enemies float by. So it\u2019s this point that, if you are optimized for survivability, that tends to make you dominant competitor over time, right? Time is on your side! Whereas time would be a raid against all of your competitors. And as time being the ultimate judge of all things, it\u2019s probably the defining competitive competency you could have, is just really high resiliency or robustness, or ideally even, antifragility, where you\u2019re actually improving from the hostility you face in the world! And advancing through adversity! So I thought that was interesting and clearly plays really well into the Bitcoin narrative. We were looking at how the terrain had shaped battles throughout history and why America fighting in Europe in say World War II was much different than war taking place on American soil. We were fighting and attacking the soft underbelly as Saylor called it, but we weren\u2019t exposed to that same level attack ourselves! Well with the small exception of Pearl Harbor. And that\u2019s why the nation that controls the sea controls the world, because that is the terrain that it\u2019s the hardest to project power and dominion across, so whoever is dominant there just runs things! You can move energy around the world much more quickly and bring to force to bear much more quickly anywhere in the world. And so when you look at Bitcoin through that lens, it\u2019s like it\u2019s already the longest and most rigid chain, so it has already become dominant! If you look at digital space and compare it to the ocean, Bitcoin has dominated digital space for monetary networks! It\u2019s impossible to compete with it as money, because it\u2019s already perfected all the properties that make money money, and it\u2019s done so in this digital terrain that all other competitors would be competing for! Which is: it\u2019s a very low friction domain, so you can move things at the speed of light in the digital space. And you can defend things with cryptography at very low cost! You can basically erect these impenetrable walls of encrypted energy at relatively low cost. So Bitcoin has just optimized for that! It gives us a way to store the vital life energy that is money behind a wall that basically cannot be breached! I like that military analogy pointing to it as a very fundamental breakthrough. And the other thing there \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk about this in this episode \u2014 that I think about, is: it sort of balances this antifragility or robustness with also a degree of adaptivity. So even though Bitcoin is the longest chain and the most rigid, it has these unbendable rules that favors its holders, it also still maintains this ability to adopt new features that are beneficial to it! And one of my favorite authors and good friend, Brandon Quittem, he\u2019s written about this! In Mycelial space this is called Horizontal gene transfer. So when a Mycelium \u2014 which is the underground informational network of a fungus, like a mushroom \u2014 when it encounters a threat in the environment, it can actually code new enzymes and proteins and defense mechanisms against that threat at one particular spot. These Mycelial mats can be tens of, hundreds of square miles in size! But if it encounters a threat, it creates a formula to neutralize it, and even any one spot of that Mycelial mat, it can incorporate those lessons into the entire organism! So it\u2019s actually learning from interaction with its competitors at the edges, but then incorporating all of its lessons into the entire organism! Which is something that Bitcoin is capable of doing! So it\u2019s kind of a tangent but pretty interesting stuff in regards to Bitcoin! And then, as we said earlier, what distinguishes us as human is that we have this unique ability \u2014 I think Saylor described it earlier \u2014 we\u2019re the only animal that plays with fire. So we have this special ability to mold our behavior in a way that allows us to harness energy and then we can channel it. We can create these abstractions of thought and speech in the ideological space, and then we can use that energy to energize these formulas that we\u2019ve created. And that\u2019s what makes us human! That\u2019s what we do! When you look at anything \u2014 you look at a table or a house or a computer, all of these things began as ideas that we then funneled energy into. We harnessed energy in the natural world whether its hydrocarbons or fire \u2014 which was kind of the Stone Age energy network \u2014 solar radiation, whatever it may be! And we channel that energy into the manifestation of these ideas. And that\u2019s what helps us become more productive and enjoy a higher quality of life over time. It\u2019s such a radical new way to look at humanity, it really makes you appreciate being human! I think too, we were talking about the naval power and how that\u2019s shaped us throughout history. Naval power was the predominant aspect of what determined which nation is in geopolitical control, but what I think \u2014 and I got this from I book I read called The Next 100 Years \u2014 that predicted that in the 21st century it would actually no longer be control of the seas that mattered so much, but it would come to be control of space. And you see that somewhat in US military dominance today in that we control the seas actually with our aircraft carriers, which essentially means we can control the air space of nations. Again back to fighting the battle on the terrain that favors you most: by going into the sky\u2014again this very frictionless space of air \u2014 we\u2019re also able to take advantage of the gravity well that is the planet. So we can drop bombs at a very low cost. For a plane to release a bomb is essentially no cost once it\u2019s up there, but it brings us gigantic force to bear on its terrestrial targets! And that\u2019s why it\u2019s in that sense we can consider today being this extension of naval power. It has the highest optionality. It has the greatest, most degrees of freedom both offensively and defensively. It\u2019s really hard to shoot down one of these aircrafts moving at supersonic speed, which gives it a lot of defensive capability, but it also can bring a lot of force to bear really quickly by dropping bombs or shooting missiles. And all of this is facilitated by control of that frictionless space in the sea, which is the aircraft carrier, which itself is very hard to attack because it\u2019s thousands of miles out to sea, it\u2019s just flying these planes in! So that\u2019s why the aircraft carrier today is the dominant military technology. But I think as we get further into the 21st century, if you go even another layer higher say into low-Earth orbit, you can get into a territory that has even more offensive and defensive optionality, and it\u2019s just way harder to attack! It\u2019s literally in orbit! And in the book I referred to, The Next 100 Years, I think they were called ion cannons. So the thought was, whichever country came to get these ion cannons into orbit first would have a power that\u2019s even superordinate to what we consider aircraft carriers to be today. So the space \u2014 if you want to call it space, it\u2019s kind of just Earth orbit \u2014 is the next frontier for military dominance. I think that will be really interesting to see shake out as we look at the development of history through this lens going forward. And Saylor brought up that book The Moon is a Harsh Mistress that really brought this point home to me, because there were these rebels on the Moon, and they were tired of being tyrannized by Earthlings, so they basically took advantage of their ultimate high ground and just started throwing rocks at Earth! And because it was at the bottom of that gravity well, the Earthlings were forced to capitulate eventually and give into their demands! So it just keeps going back to this principle of holding high ground, holding the best terrain in any confrontation. [51:35] Like the moon, digital space, it is the ultimate high ground! It enables us, even as an individual today with Bitcoin, you can safeguard Billions of dollars of capital, which is life force, by memorizing a 12-word seed phrase. You can move it around the world at the speed of light permissionlessly at virtually zero cost! If you\u2019re talking about moving $1 Billion worth of Bitcoin you can probably move it for from $5-$20. You try to move that same $1 Billion across space in a fiat currency system, you\u2019re gonna spend a lot of time navigating regulations of both the regime you\u2019re sending from and the regime you\u2019re sending to, you\u2019re gonna pay a lot of bank fees, you\u2019re gonna be answering a lot of questions, you\u2019re gonna be probably paying a lot of taxes as well. The number one export of empires is being security! They gatecheck all these movements of value across their domain. And so these rights and abilities that were reserved for the nation states in eras past \u2014 where they could move goods and capital \u2014 if they\u2019re dominant militarily they could do so pretty much without permission, they could do whatever they want! That same capability is now being delivered to the individual via software! So it\u2019s this radical new worldview that\u2019s shaking out where, because we don\u2019t need an empire to honor \u2014 at least the property rights of money with Bitcoin \u2014 as far as we can see today, maybe other property rights will follow as well in time. But that is a big slice out of a pie! We also don\u2019t need the nation states to honor the property rights of money, that entire function of trust and security has fallen to distributed software! And it\u2019s hard to even fathom how big of a game changer that really is! And when I think about that a little more, it\u2019s just that these digital high seas, they\u2019re weakening the geographic constraints to being. All of a sudden, you\u2019re not as beholden to the local monopolies and systems, because you can now participate in this global network that has many more degrees of freedom and a much lower need for permissions. You don\u2019t need to check as many boxes and satisfy as many bureaucrats interacting with the digital domain. It really is this much more of a pure free market environment, where the best ideas win if you\u2019re able to serve your customer! By whatever means necessary you can earn a living! My mind goes back to a story of girls in the Middle East that are actually prohibited from holding bank accounts! It\u2019s illegal for women to hold bank accounts in certain countries, so this contributes to their disenfranchisement, because they can\u2019t even earn a living in the home. So women not only are perceived as second-class citizens but in many ways are second-class citizens because they can\u2019t hold a bank account, they can\u2019t contribute to the livelihood of their home, so they\u2019re just forced to stay home and work and do as their told, while the men go out and make a living! But with Bitcoin, some of the women at least were able to find jobs online! Whether it\u2019s copy-editing or anything you could do that was informational. Any job that you could conduct online, which is more and more jobs as we become more advanced. And they were able to be paid and remunerated in Bitcoin! So all of a sudden they just leapfrogged this entire restrictive system that would really prevent them from even increasing their own condition in life. They cannot improve their own conditions because they\u2019re trapped in this cage, but all of a sudden Bitcoin gave them this exit option to just go out into the world and earn a living based on their own skills! So that\u2019s just one example of how the geographic constraints are weakened. And I think we\u2019ll see many more of those coming out. Another thing that comes to mind here is: I\u2019ve analogized Amazon in the past. Amazon came to be a dominant monopoly in the world because they essentially out-competed four digital distribution networks, which are a naturally scarce service for the world. You only need \u2014 it has a huge network effect, so there\u2019s big economies of scale and a big advantage to being bigger in that space. And Amazon was able to bootstrap itself in a way by leveraging two things, two benefits of being digital and not being a brick and mortar. Firstly, they were able to offer low prices to their customer because they had lower costs of fulfillment. They didn\u2019t have brick and mortar stores. For a while they were skirting sales tax, so they would distribute from a state that had low to no sales tax, and they were selling it to other states without being deemed for sales tax. So they\u2019re taking advantage of this digital space. And then Two, because in a bookstore you can only fit so many titles. Maybe you can fit only a quarter million books in a store, but the advantage to being online in an online store is that you have literally limitless selection! Anything that is available on Earth, you can sell in your store! So I think that\u2019s one of the reasons Bezos zeroed in on books \u2014 Amazon started out as an online book store \u2014 is because that is a product where that advantage is super favorable! There are millions of books written, the selection is just endless! They\u2019re a totally non-fungible thing. Every book is different. And I think Bezos started there and used that as his pressure point, because he could leverage not only the sales tax and lack of brick and mortar as we mentioned earlier, but he could also leverage the limitless selection capability of an Internet-based bookstore to really just dethrone a lot of competition. So he could offer it at lower prices and he could offer it at wider selection! So super interesting there! And he was smart enough to leverage the advantages of the digital business model in a really pressure-point focused way! And when I look at tech and Bitcoin through that lens, I see \u2014 and Saylor alluded to this as well \u2014 the overall trend is that distributed software and encryption is very empowering to the individual! So these things that we used to need large entities to satisfy, because there are a lot of fixed costs that you had to incur to deliver these functions, whether it was a bookstore or whether it was a bank custodying your gold \u2014 all of a sudden we could do these things via software at very low fixed cost! It can be replicated at near zero variable cost! So once it\u2019s up and running you can basically do it anywhere net of the actual physical distribution fees! Assuming there are some, right? If it\u2019s software there\u2019s basically no distribution fee either. That\u2019s what the Apple App Store is. And so, it\u2019s interesting to see how that \u2014 I\u2019m thinking about this a lot. It\u2019s like, Okay, we needed empires and large entities in the past to provide security, to create this intersubjective fabric of trust in the world so that we could interoperate, but now a lot of these human-based politicized or politicizable institutions are now going into trust-minimized software! Where it\u2019s like, Here are the rules, you can\u2019t bend them or break them! And Bitcoin is just the greatest expression of that! Amazon and stuff like that they still have a political dimension because they\u2019re traditional organizations. They\u2019re essentially under control. But something like Bitcoin is just a pure instance of that: it\u2019s just pure unbendable, unbreakable rules that help you channel energy across time and space, and satisfy wants more efficiently! I think too \u2014 and this gets a bit into the Sovereign Individual thesis \u2014 we didn\u2019t get into this a lot in the interview but, as people wake up to this truth that we have this ultimate savings technology in cyberspace or this non-state central bank, whatever we want to call it, it\u2019s a medium for permissionlessly storing your wealth in a way to no one can compromise! And you don\u2019t need any government to then acknowledge or honor the property rights you have in Bitcoin. You\u2019ve converted property rights to information! Owning is now knowing! With the increasing incentives to exit inflationary currency \u2014 again the book The Sovereign Individual goes really deep into this, but \u2014 the numbers are roughly: for every $10,000 you can reduce your tax liability, assuming you can compound that capital at an average return rate of 10%, you\u2019re talking about tens of millions of dollars over the average earner\u2019s lifetime. It becomes at least a multi-million dollar and in many cases tens of millions of dollars decision of holding your money in an inflationary fiat versus holding your money in non-inflationary Bitcoin. So I think as the market wakes up to this and starts to do the calculus, I think you\u2019re just gonna see this overwhelming demand for security from distributed tech \u2014 with such secure money as in Bitcoin \u2014 and it\u2019s just gonna pull demand out of these anachronistic security models like the nation state and banks and all these other politicized institutions! And you know \u2014 wow! It\u2019s just a lot to even think about! It\u2019s hard to even fathom where that goes! The Sovereign Individual predicted social media, they predicted Bitcoin. Another thing they predicted was the actual digitization of security \u2014 so other property rights getting eaten by software. And my general thought there is that the government\u2019s not gonna let go of any of this willingly. It\u2019s not like the government ever acknowledged and accepted Bitcoin! Bitcoin just grew up in the wild somewhat flying under the radar long enough to establish itself as something that\u2019s really difficult to take down now. Today I think we\u2019re at $350 Billion market cap of Bitcoin, so it\u2019s a really entrenched monetary network at this point, and it\u2019s exhibited a lot of antifragility! I think as \u2014 my theory would be \u2014 as Bitcoin continues to ascend and demonetize inflationary government business models, that some of these functions that governments have bureaucratized will just start to fall to free market competitors. There\u2019s just gonna come a point where governments no longer solve enough to keep \u2014 one example I like that I heard from Saifedean is \u2014 there\u2019s a national train agency in Lebanon, and he made the point that there hasn\u2019t been a track of railroad in Lebanon for 50 years. It\u2019s that old saying that, There\u2019s nothing more permanent than a temporary government solution! So we have all these layers of unnecessary bureaucratic buildup across the world in all the countries! Because they\u2019re not accountable to their PnL! There\u2019s no free market competition keeping them honest! So they get away with these asinine models where they have a train committee but no trains! So I think as those useless or worthless or unaccountable institutions start to shrivel up and die because there\u2019s no funding for them, that you\u2019ll see whatever functions that they provided or were intended to provide start to fall into the free market \u2014 I think software is just eating that up! So that is a lot to think about, and it\u2019s something to keep your eye on! I also liked how Saylor dove into this diffusion of technology which is really just another way of saying the diffusion of ideas. And it follows the S-curve. This is\u2014I think it\u2019s The History of Scientific Revolutions \u2014 and it talks about this S-curve where there\u2019s a beginning or there\u2019s innovators that adopt it first, and then it hits an inflection point say around 13.5% market penetration, and the innovation starts becoming adopted at a super accelerated rate! So the curve just goes vertical for a while until it\u2019s suffused and saturated the market sufficiently where it starts to level off and you have the laggards sort of adopting it late. And when we look at Bitcoin through that lens, we\u2019re very early in the flat part of the curve. We\u2019re far below 13.5% total adoption! We\u2019re probably more in the range of 1\u20133% as we sit here in late 2020. And Saylor just makes this great point that those curves are impossible to predict! You never know when it\u2019s going to work! The idea can exist for hundreds of years before it ever gets commercialized! You think back to the Native Americans that had the pottery wheel, but never figured out to turn it on its side and use it as a wagon wheel! The idea was there but no one had harnessed it or commercialized it! But his point is that once it does become commercialized it hits a certain critical mass that it\u2019s very clear to see that you can invest in it now \u2014 like we\u2019re almost right before it hits that vertical point and reaches just huge gains as the rest of the world wakes up to the importance and utility of the innovation! And I thought that was great. The other thing \u2014 in his book The Virtual Wave, which I read preparing for this \u2014 he laid out in 2010 saying Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google \u2014 buy these, hold \u2014 they\u2019re gonna eat everything! Don\u2019t diversify! Here\u2019s why \u2014 going into the network effects and all of this history of scientific revolutions and paradigm shifts. He saw that! And he\u2019s now proclaiming Bitcoin to be a similar pattern of proliferation! It has reached this critical mass! We\u2019re north of $100 Billion market cap! The race has been won, almost, for digital money, and now it\u2019s just a question of how big does digital money become relative to everything else, relative to analog money? If you\u2019re keen to believe the advantages that digital tech has over analog tech, I mean clearly I\u2019m a Bitcoin bull, I would say it eats all of \u2018em! It offers so much more utility to the users, and it\u2019s so much more energy efficient! It\u2019s as if: you don\u2019t adopt it \u2014 you just get left behind! So there\u2019s this Darwinian propulsion to adopt the hardest money and we can\u2019t get any harder than Bitcoin! It\u2019s 21 Million fixed and forever! And then he brought up too that these things seem crazy at first, like when the Wright brothers finally flew, had their first maiden voyage and figured out how to fly, he made the point that anyone you interviewed up until that time \u2014 you could have interviewed the smartest people in the world, they would tell you flat out it\u2019s not possible, mankind will never fly, it just can\u2019t be done! Until it\u2019s done, right? Until a tinkerer figures it out in their garage! Which points to \u2014 it\u2019s the tinkerers and not the theoreticians that bring about breakthrough! I feel like some people think that there are geniuses sitting inside of Harvard writing out a bunch of complex formulas that figure out this practical mechanical innovation in the world, and that\u2019s just largely not the case! It\u2019s entrepreneurs putting their skin in the game, failing, failing forward, learning from their mistakes, facing the unknown, adapting to the unknown, trying new things, and then all of a sudden there\u2019s a breakthrough! All of a sudden, the plane flies, the Wright brothers are sky-bound! So that\u2019s what drives humanity forward! It\u2019s this relentless impulse to tinker and play with things, not the intellectuals sitting in their ivory towers theorizing. And he brought up too that John Harrison \u2014 no one could figure out longitude! It was easy to figure out lattitude, but no one could figure out longitude. And how did they solve it? They put a reward in the paper! It was a \u00a310,000 reward: anyone that could solve this, how to calculate longitude, we\u2019ll give you a financial reward! So what did they do? They went to the free market! They incentivized the collective intelligence of humanity\u2014as best they could \u2014 through the newspaper at the time, and this guy John Harrison the clock maker comes out of the woodwork and figures out, Hey! I can solve this spatial problem which is the calculation of longitude at sea, with a temporal answer! He\u2019s a clock maker, right? So he makes this super-precise clock, which is just kind of out of the blue! Like, had he been a theoretician, he would\u2019ve just sat there and tried to figure out how to calculate space and observational things, but this guy took a 180 and he solved a spatial problem with a temporal solution. And that\u2019s the kind of problem-solving you get out of the free market that you just won\u2019t get out of legislated innovation or think tanks or things like this! So the point there I think is: you can\u2019t push water! Innovation is something that emerges naturally through us \u2014 our creative impulse! You can\u2019t force it! You can\u2019t yell at your garden to grow faster, right? It needs to go through its own natural process of discovery to get the best ideas to the surface! And the only thing we can hope to do in our socioeconomic systems is to incentivize that, right? They gave, they put a reward in the paper for this! That\u2019s what the free market is! Just go into the world: you have the liberty to do pretty much anything you want as long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone, kill anyone, or steal from anyone \u2014 these are the actual pillars of free market capitalism! And make bets! Invest your time, energy, and capital onto things you think \u2014 onto solving problems you think the market wants solved! And you think you have a unique way to do it! And by betting against one another, we develop better, faster, and cheaper ways of doing things! We incentivize this ideation process that rewards humanity forever in the form of innovation! And I like to say there that it\u2019s the tinkering entrepreneurs \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more problematic to problems than tinkering entrepreneurs! If we want to solve problems, we need to harness our collective ingenuity, and we do that through free market capitalism and tinkering, not through legislation! Finally, we got into war. We talked about it as an accelerant to innovation. My thought there is pretty simple. It\u2019s just that: war pushes you into a domain of high uncertainty where the relevance of everything becomes accentuated, because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen next, you don\u2019t know maybe how much food you need to save, or money, or what kind of money, or weapons, or where you need to be \u2014 everything becomes much more relevant when you\u2019re in unexplored territory, so to speak. And that \u2014 and they say, Necessity is the mother of all invention \u2014 it\u2019s like, all of a sudden, you\u2019re pushed by your survival instinct to necessarily figure out all your now very relevant surroundings very quickly. So it accelerates that S-curve adoption, or it accelerates these ideas that may have been idle for some time! All of a sudden there\u2019s a big impetus to figure it out. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now in 2020. We have a war on cash, we have a war on COVID, everyone\u2019s strapped into seclusion, a lot of people are out of work, inflation is right around the corner, so everyone\u2019s been pushed to figure things out and I love that Saylor paints that picture of the war on COVID being an accelerant to Bitcoin and to digital technologies more generally! And finally, I love this quote that he references from Arthur C. Clarke that, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic! All of these modern miracles that we take for granted, they\u2019re all generated from free markets, and if you pull a primitive man out of the Stone Age and brought him here into 2020, he would just be flabbergasted! All of this stuff just looks like magic: this camera, this laptop. And that\u2019s why Bitcoin is so misunderstood \u2014 consider the joke, right? Magic Internet Money! It\u2019s disparaged like that! But what I think it actually is is that it is this radically more innovative and advanced technology that people are just trying to get their head around! And also there in the long run and the great promise of it is to help us make even more magic in the free market! To create even more advanced technologies by eliminating the barriers to trade! Again, tinkerers operating freely in the open marketplace is where we discover all the new and useful things that make life easier and better! And we\u2019ve honored that paradigm to some extent \u2014 especially in Western civilization \u2014 but we\u2019ve erected these artificial barriers to it with fiat currency and central banking and overly complex tax codes, convoluted laws \u2014 all these things are frictions to free trade! So Bitcoin by defunding these inefficient institutions, it\u2019s eroding these barriers to free trade, and therefore bolstering the innovation generated by free markets! So in that sense I think Bitcoin not only is a magic internet money, but it\u2019s going to make the world much more magical in the long run! I hope you guys enjoyed that! That was Episode 3 with Michael Saylor. We\u2019ve probably got 10 episodes total, so we\u2019ll be back soon with the next one. Until then, take care!"}

This is Robert Breedlove, and welcome to Episode 2 of the Saylor Series on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! So in Episode 1, we covered the rise of Man through the Stone and the Iron Ages. So we went into ancient technologies. We talked about fire, missiles, and hydraulics [inaudible]. And now in this episode we\u2019re gonna go a little further in this arc of Man, and we\u2019re gonna go into the Dark Ages. We\u2019re gonna go learn how missing one key step along the path of civilization actually caused us to slide backwards and to regress, and that civilization is not a guarantee! It is something that must be continually pushed forward and maintained across time. We\u2019ll also get into how humanity re-emerged from the Dark Ages, ultimately into the Industrial Age and the Steel Age, which enabled a lot of very important technologies like cities, aviation, and railroads \u2014 things of this sort. So we\u2019re going to touch on, again, the benefits that are offered by standardization. Also the benefits of protocol, similar to the ones we talked about in Ancient Roman times earlier, and how the economic benefits of the standardization \u2014 one language or one protocol \u2014 actually accrete to civilization. So these cost efficiencies accrete to us in the form of being able to satisfy wants faster, cheaper, and better! And that\u2019s actually the force that drives civilization and increases both economic and network density for mankind. [03:06] We\u2019re also gonna talk about how violence and monopolization have shaped the course of history. How violence has been used to extract rents and taxes, how gatekeepers have influenced the course of history, and how monopolies have developed in both a natural and an unnatural way. And we\u2019ll also talk about packaged foods, and how much of an influence that had on civilization, enabling us to store energy in a leak-proof container. And also mankind\u2019s ability to eradicate some infectious diseases was such a huge boon to humanity in terms of increasing life expectancy and quality of life as well. Again, the general aim of this is to construct a solid intellectual foundation on which to understand the profound impact that we believe Bitcoin will have on the world. And you can think about Bitcoin, as Saylor refers to it, as an engineering breakthrough, and that for the first time in history, we have a technology that is able to store the energetic of life force that money represents! Again we can think of money as a claim on all of the sources of energy in the world, whether it\u2019s capital, chemical energy, kinetic energy, food energy \u2014 all these types of energy, money acts as kind of a meta-energy. And we\u2019ve never had a monetary technology that was totally leak-proof, and that it did not lose value over time! So hopefully by drawing analogies to these very important innovations across history, you\u2019ll start to have an emerging realization of the real importance and significance of Bitcoin! So with that, let\u2019s jump into Episode 2 and at the end of this I\u2019ll do a little outro to hopefully synthesize some of these ideas. Alright, thanks!"}

But we got here \u2014 that\u2019s impressive! We have the Roman rise, and we saw a sophisticated society mastering energy networks, logistics networks, advanced tools, political processes, in order to dominate their sphere of influence. By the age of the Antonines, around Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius \u2014 this is like 100 years, it\u2019s a golden age of Rome \u2014 it\u2019s like 90 A.D. to 180 A.D., the average life expectancy of a Roman is 72! And so you\u2019ve got bathes, you\u2019ve got writing, you\u2019ve got civilization, you\u2019ve got sanitation, you\u2019ve got aqueducts, you\u2019ve got roads \u2014 they\u2019ve got stuff pretty well organized in sophisticated machines. And then of course we take a hard left-turn into the Dark Ages and stuff just starts to break down! And it\u2019s a reminder that nothing is certain \u2014 if you miss a key insight, you could waste 1,000 years! And stuff could\u2019ve happened a different way \u2014 it didn\u2019t. For example, let\u2019s take the printing press: the Chinese developed printing presses way back, 2,000 years ago. They never really thought to commercialize them, and the Chinese alphabet\u2019s a pictographic alphabet, so you would\u2019ve needed 25,000 different type pieces in order to have movable type in a printing press, and so they had the wrong language to develop printing presses! The Romans had the Roman alphabet which is an ideal language because you can actually print anything with just like 26 or 50 pieces of movable type, and they had all the knowledge but for some reason \u2014 anybody could\u2019ve figured it out, Robert! \u2014like all you gotta do is walk in your boots through the mud and step on a nice floor and look down, and there\u2019s the idea for a printing press! Tracks in the mud! Right? They had paint, they had dyes, and you know, they\u2019re just oh so close, and then they don\u2019t hit it, and we wait until whatever, 1453 or something for Gutenberg to work this out, and we\u2019re gonna suffer for 1,000 years! It\u2019s amazing to me how certain things can be just right in front of a civilization and they just won\u2019t grab \u2018em! Like if you go to St. Peter\u2019s square to the Vatican and you look at that column \u2014 it\u2019s now St. Peter\u2019s column but it used to be Trajan\u2019s column. And Trajan\u2019s column was put up to celebrate the triumph of Trajan and his wars. And it\u2019s a bas-relief, a marble relief of the Dacian wars, and it wraps, spirals up the column, has a little staircase in the middle of it, a work of art, and architecture, and at the top, eventually the Roman Catholics put the statue of St. Peter, I guess! And in the ancient Roman times, that had Trajan\u2019s statue on it! And Trajan is standing there in his Imperial robes, and he\u2019s holding his hand up in the air and do you know what he\u2019s holding in his hand?"}

It\u2019s like the Romans knew the world was not flat! And if they hadn\u2019t ripped his statue off the column 1,000 years earlier or whenever they ripped it off and buried it somewhere, they would\u2019ve known the world is round, and it\u2019s so ironic that you could learn and then forget such a basic thing!"}

I\u2019ll tell you another one that blows my mind! If you go to the Museum of the Native American Indian in Washington D.C., and you walk around, you see there\u2019s an entire civilization, I mean they\u2019re pretty much hunter-gatherers, and if you want to understand how hunter-gatherers lived, I mean, the American-Indian, the Native Americans, the way they were when Europeans showed up in America is probably your best proxy for what the Paleolithic man was, I guess. But amongst all the artifacts they gathered, you walk around, you eventually find a pottery wheel. And the pottery wheel, it\u2019s a wheel in stone, and it\u2019s got a beautiful piece of pottery, and the sign says, glowingly, Native Americans had very sophisticated pottery and they knew how to mold clay and they used this pottery wheel to do it. And I look at the wheel, and I think, for 5,000 years, nobody in the entire continent thought to take the wheel and turn it this way and roll it? Like, they knew wheel, they knew wheel was useful \u2014 I give you the wheel, Robert! But they never invented the wheelbarrow! They never invented the wagon! There\u2019s no rolling stock anywhere in America!"}

Life expectancy plunges down to 30 years, from 72 years, and a world without technology, if you don\u2019t have aqueducts and sanitation and rules like, Don\u2019t bring your horse into the middle of the village because he\u2019s gonna crap all over everything and you\u2019re going to get sick! In the absence of all those orderly rules, then you have just a degradation of the human condition! And we started to crawl out with the Renaissance, and what\u2019s interesting there I think is if you look at all of the great cities in the world, all the great cities grew as nexus, as the central node of an empire. So Rome was the nexus of an empire. Carthage was the nexus of an empire. When they lose their empire, they collapse! The only way you generate enough money to make a great city, you have to scrape a tax off of all the energy, all the commercial value, in a large place. A fisherman casts a wide net to capture the fish \u2014 that\u2019s your empire! The Roman schtick was, Pay us 10% when it comes into Rome and 10% when it goes into the next port and we\u2019ll take 20% or maybe 30% out of the value added or whatever we\u2019re gonna take. If you go into Venice and you look around the grand canal, you see all these palazzos \u2014 they\u2019re all just warehouses! I bring a ship into Venice, I off-load my cargo, and then it goes out the back and it gets barged up and down the canal, and it gets transshipped to a new ship. In that world, each ship ran this route: Venice to Alexandria was one trade route, Venice to Rome was another trade route, Venice to Istanbul was another trade route! You\u2019re at the nexus, you\u2019re running these shipping networks, and of course you\u2019ve gotta bribe the guy in Istanbul, or maybe your son marries his daughter, and that\u2019s how you get to come in and out of Istanbul without getting murdered or without getting your stuff stolen. And eventually all the families in Venice intermarry, like I know you, you\u2019re my second-cousin, that\u2019s how we don\u2019t cheat each other! And there\u2019s no way\u2014you can\u2019t solve the traveling salesman problem\u2014there\u2019s no way you can take a ship from Istanbul to Alexandria to Venice to Rome to Ibiza or wherever I would go \u2014 Barcelona \u2014 because I would basically get overtaxed or extorted in each port unless I actually was friendly! So the way that works is, you have a hub and spoke system, and there\u2019s always one central city, and there\u2019s always one set of families or companies, and they intermarry and they trust each other, and they just agree, I\u2019m gonna buy wheat for a dime in Alexandria, I\u2019m going to bring it to Venice and I\u2019m going to sell it to you for 50 cents, you\u2019re going to take it to Barcelona and sell it for $1, and you\u2019re gonna pay a nickel in tax to the guy on the other end. You\u2019re gonna get your 45 cents, I\u2019m gonna get my 45 cents, those guys get paid $1, those guys get paid a nickel. We can play with, What\u2019s the mark up, right? It might be I buy it for a quarter, sell it for 0.50 and you sell it for 0.75 to the dudes that sell it for $1. But invariably, it\u2019s the people at the center of the network that are actually getting 10, 20, 30, 50% of all the commerce! Which is all the energy! And what\u2019s the definition of a smuggler? Or a pirate? The definition of a smuggler is someone who doesn\u2019t want to give me half their stuff! So, how do I stop that? I have to have a navy that goes to kill them! So you have the Carthaginian navy stopping smuggling so they can tax half the stuff! And that\u2019s why the Romans can\u2019t \u2014 Carthago delenda est, right? \u2014 Pliny the Elder or Cato, I forget which one, said in every speech he gave in the Senate for 20 years, Carthago delenda est \u2014 Carthage must be destroyed! Why? Because two people can\u2019t shake down the same guy of half his stuff \u2014 there\u2019s nothing left! If I take half your stuff as a tax, I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s like the tax wars! The Carthaginians are taxing the shippers and the Romans want the money! Therefore, the Romans must defeat the Carthaginians! Now the Romans tax you, then they fall, then the Venetians rise! Now the Venetian navy controls the Med. Then you\u2019ve got \u2014 you know, you ever go to Venice, there\u2019s this great Renaissance painting, The Battle of Lepanto. And The Battle of Lepanto is when the king of Spain allies with the Pope from Rome, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, and with the Doge of Venice. And those three navies fight the Turks, the invading Muslims from Istanbul \u2014 and they beat them! And it\u2019s the triumph of Christendom! But it gets you thinking: why were they all killing each other in the first place over the Med? And you realize it\u2019s because they\u2019re fighting over control of the mercantile network! And then the next interesting observation is, you\u2019ve heard the word Roman Catholic Church, right? You ever hear the phrase, Venetian Catholic?"}

The Catholic Church in the entire Venetian empire didn\u2019t terminate with the Pope in Rome. It terminated with the Doge in Venice! And so that means all tithes, all due, goes to Venice and stops! You can\u2019t have an empire, unless the person at the top of the empire is also in control of the religion, because if you don\u2019t control of the religion, then someone else takes half your money, you see? It\u2019s all about energy flow! And the energy is flowing \u2014 by the way, the Pontifex Maximus originally refers to the Roman consul, to the head of Rome! Augustus Caesar was the Pontifex Maximus. So the Romans had eventually the high priest. So the Roman consuls were the high priest of Rome for 700 years! If you\u2019re elected the general, you\u2019re also the priest. You run all the religious ceremonies. They didn\u2019t separate those two! So the church and the mercantile empire and the power to tax migrates from Rome to Venice. When did Venice start to decline? When they lost control of the church! At the end of the day, they start sinking, because you can\u2019t afford to maintain those buildings. You can\u2019t afford 100-story buildings in Manhattan unless you\u2019re the center of a financial empire! I have to basically buy your bonds for 68 cents on the dollar and sell them for 82 cents on the dollar and cut the difference. You know there are a lot of securities on Wall Street where there\u2019s only two market makers: there\u2019s the one bank and the other bank and they trade with each other, and if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re buying at the top of the spread and you\u2019re selling at the bottom of the spread. And the spread is 2%, Robert! So if I turn over $1 Billion worth of bonds, I\u2019m paying $20 Million in commissions, and there\u2019s a monopoly there, and the $20 Million is just flowing into what? It\u2019s flowing into the building! My buddy works for that bank and I work for this bank and we drink together and we just kind of joke about the 200 basis point spread!"}

By the way, if you go to Amsterdam, Amsterdam is a city of canals! If you\u2019ve ever seen a distribution center, the trucks come in one side, it goes through a very complicated set of conveyors, and it goes out the other side! These trucks come from the manufacturers, those trucks go to the stores or the locales, and the distribution center is a maze of conveyors. Amsterdam\u2019s that, but it\u2019s that for barges, before we had machines. That\u2019s what Venice is! That\u2019s what they did in every mercantile center. And when you get to Martin Luther\u2019s time, you realize one of the key drivers is there\u2019s no way that we can rise or elevate our civilization if we have to send all of our money to Rome! You see this struggle throughout medieval history \u2014 William the Conqueror had that struggle, you see the struggle of the Northern European German nobles, and then of course it punctuates itself with Henry VIII, who eventually forms the Anglican church so he can be the Pontifex Maximus, and if the church terminates with the King of England, they don\u2019t have to ship any money down to Italy, nor do they have to ask permission to change their alliances and get married and do what they will. It\u2019s useful to have God on your side! [Inaudible] useful! And so that drives a lot of stuff throughout the Renaissance and you can say that Northern Europe broke off from the Roman Catholic Church for religious reasons, or you could say the Northern European powers that be created the religion for political and economic reasons, to break off from the Roman Catholic Church! But either way, it\u2019s kind of a triumph of history that everybody\u2019s forgotten that there used to be lots of \u2014 why do they call it Roman Catholic if there weren\u2019t other Catholics? How many different branches of the Catholic church do you think there were? Like, a thousand! They just kind of coalesced over time! But here\u2019s the general principle: everywhere on Earth where you see a big city, it was the center of an empire! Paris, London, Hong Kong, New York, Venice, Rome! Everywhere! And by the way, everywhere where you see a city that\u2019s fallen upon hard times, that\u2019s been destroyed \u2014 it\u2019s empire lapsed! Carthage, Troy, right? You could name them on and on and on! Venice\u2014had an empire, lost an empire. And that\u2019s because you can\u2019t physically create this kind of economic density. I mean, you go to Paris and you look at the Cathedral of Notre Dame and you look at how much human effort went into creating Notre Dame \u2014 there are people that are selling postcards and bottled water in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral making money off of tourists, where the guys inherited the concession from his father\u2019s father\u2019s father\u2019s father, and if you go back 10 generations, the concession was 700 years old! They are living off of the vestiges of an empire long past, and now the question is: what are the empires of the future? Where do they form? And that takes us really to the Steel Age, the 19th century, the robber barons and the like, and you can see \u2014 with shipping networks, those canals gave way to free ports and eventually gave way to container ships, and container ships totally remade everything and they shifted power to Singapore and Hong Kong and companies like Maersk. And ultimately it\u2019s a low-energy \u2014 it\u2019s a componentized way to move things around! The most efficient to move anything on Earth is modern containers! By the way, the biggest rage and technology in service today is containerized software via Kubernetes and Docker. Which is the same principle as: put all your stuff in the container ship, and then the container goes onto a ship, they get standard loading facilities into a port, they\u2019ve got standard train cars and standard trucks \u2014 everything\u2019s standardized! And the cost and the transparency of that was cut maybe by an order of magnitude with that innovation!"}

Standardization once again! So I do have a question about these empires that we\u2019ve discussed historically: ostensibly the purpose of an empire like this is to basically preserve the walls of the city, protect the peace, honor private property rights within that dominion, enforce contract law, ensure that there\u2019s a non-violent means for dispute resolution such that commerce can be conducted fluidly. And you mentioned the Empires of the future \u2014 this is something I think about a lot, is that we\u2019ve always needed this monopolist on violence to sort of honor private property rights within their jurisdiction. But another really interesting aspect of Bitcoin is it\u2019s kind of the first private property right that is agnostic of government completely! You don\u2019t need government to enforce your right to hold private keys! It\u2019s like holding physical gold or any other bearer instrument. So I wonder how much that plays into the relevance of an empire in the historical sense going into the future?"}

The #1 export in the United States is security! Like literally, I can live in Miami Beach and I don\u2019t worry about someone shooting me across the intracoastal waterway. And if I was in certain other parts of the world I\u2019d be surrounded by 100 bodyguards \u2014 so, security! They have that saying about Genghis Khan, they said, When the Mongols controlled all of Asia, a virgin could\u2019ve ridden from one end of the empire to the other with a pot of gold on her head and not be molested! The Mongols weren\u2019t screwing around either! You intercept their mail, if anything gets stolen, anybody gets hurt, they show up with an army and they murder everybody for 100 miles in every direction, trying to make the point: don\u2019t eff with the system! Now most of these empires they generally provide this kind of security for their citizens, not always for the non-citizens or the aliens or the slaves or the whatever \u2014 the underclass. But they do manage to establish them! [32:57] Bitcoin is security, and Bitcoin\u2019s #1 value proposition is security! It\u2019s security of energy. If energy is translated to money and money is translated is translated into Bitcoin and you store it on the Bitcoin network, you\u2019re securitizing your assets in a cloud of \u2014 behind a wall of \u2014 encrypted energy. And in that regard, it provides an important right and empowerment to the individual! It hasn\u2019t quite addressed the physical security element. When do we actually come up with something that will surround your person with a field of repulsive energy. Your own force field! Then you will have accomplished the same thing in the physical domain that Bitcoin does in the virtual domain. But if I secure your life force \u2014 money is energy, is life force, money is power \u2014 if I secure your power, that can be converted into physical security either by allowing you to travel away from the [threat]. We have the example \u2014 Nazi Germany in the 30's \u2014 all the Jews had their money locked up in Germany and so the way the system worked is they operated as bankers and they allowed people to launder their money out of Germany and they would take a hair cut of 10, 20, 30% initially, then 50%, then 70%, then 90%, until pretty soon it was like a 90% hair cut to get your value out, and so consequently, people didn\u2019t want to leave! And so if you don\u2019t have your monetary power or your assets secured virtually, then your physical security is always at risk because you can\u2019t leave nor can you protect yourself, right? You can\u2019t pay for anything to protect yourself, and you can\u2019t get out, or you can\u2019t pay to get out! You would think that probably one of the most useful or one of the most compelling use cases of Bitcoin would be if I\u2019m a refugee trying to flee a war zone. Because it\u2019s either that or gold, and the problem with gold is there\u2019s a lot of people with guns \u2014 they\u2019re gonna take it from you! And at least with Bitcoin, you could pay the guy with the gun half the money when you started, and the other half when you got there, and the worst he could do is blow your head off, but he\u2019s not getting the money. Whereas gold, he just blows your head off \u2014 takes the gold! So yeah I think it\u2019s second order beneficial to physical security in a lot of different ways and it makes the world better, but it\u2019s first order beneficial to economic security! If we think about the Steel Age, these rail networks are another network to deliver energy faster, stronger, smarter, harder! Of course, at the nexus of every transportation hub, there\u2019s an economic center, so rail heads \u2014 if a great city is in a port, it\u2019s at the center of a railroad juncture! And a lot of times at the center of the rail juncture you can tax all the trains! So if goods come from Spain into Paris and they\u2019re going to Germany, the French get to take a tax right there in Paris! The rail heads became a nexus. The other fascinating thing about the railroads is they became really instrumental to logistics, movement of armies, and they drove economic and political power. And one interesting example is Winston Churchill when he was like 25, he wrote a book called the River War, before he was famous for anything in fact! He was quite the adventurer \u2014 he went off to fight in the war in the Sudan under Kitchener. And the entire book is about the British working to win a war in the Sudan, and they had to take Khartoum \u2014 it\u2019s like going 1,000 miles up the Nile, maybe 1,500 miles up the Nile! \u2014 across desert, and why they would even want to do it is an interesting question, but here\u2019s the bottom line: the entire outcome of the war comes down to the question, Can the British build a railroad to Khartoum? And if the British succeed in building a railroad, they win. And if they can\u2019t build a railroad, they can\u2019t provision the army and they can\u2019t move the heavy equipment and they lose the war! The entire war \u2014 it\u2019s called the River War \u2014 but it ought to be called the Railroad War. It\u2019s just about building a railroad across the desert, and at the end of the day, as soon as the railroad arrived, a bunch of guys with explosives and Gatling guns showed up, they devastated everybody and it was not a fair fight at all! Like Gatling guns versus guys with spears and musket loaders \u2014 it\u2019s kind of very unpleasant! And if you read it through the modern view, it doesn\u2019t necessarily leave you a good taste in your mouth! But it\u2019s a reminder that a lot of times, the difference between winning and losing, and living and dying, is via railroads! I think there\u2019s a similar story in the American Civil War, if you look at the way railroads functioned. Even the conquest of the continent, the Union Pacific Railroad! Once the railroad crossed the continent \u2014 it\u2019s Manifest Destiny \u2014 you think the United States was gonna dominate without that railroad? What is it, 1,000x more expensive to move stuff over land than over water? And Google is very good at saying, We don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s gonna be 10x or 100x better \u2014 I mean it\u2019s a Silicon Valley trope. Don\u2019t bother to do it unless you\u2019re gonna break through this 100x! Well all these things were 100x better, but a railroad we take for granted! I give you 5 tons of stuff \u2014 carry it from New York to California. Count the amount of energy it\u2019s gonna take you! Now put it on a railroad car \u2014 try again! You think that\u2019s not faster? And stronger? 1,000x faster? 1,000x stronger? Something like that! Orders of magnitude. And that takes us to John D. Rockefeller. Before Standard Oil comes along, people are actually hunting whales \u2014 they\u2019re getting in wooden ships chasing around in the Indian Ocean to kill a whale, boil down its blubber and make kerosene and burn a lamp! Not a very efficient way to gather energy! So then along comes oil, and oil is 1,000x more efficient way to get energy, and what Standard Oil was, was it was first an energy producer, but it was also an energy storage device! It\u2019s a battery! Because the best way to store energy is put it in a tank! It was also an energy network. Standard Oil, they bought up all the \u2014 they didn\u2019t actually buy the fields, they bought the refineries. They refined the oil, they stored the oil, they bought up all the tanker cars, they bought up all the tanker ships, they locked down all of the networks, and they basically had an energy network! They actually had guys driving around with carriages to deliver their energy to every single retail store. They had retail distribution! They would even give away the furnaces to sell the energy! They did a Jeff Bezos thing. You know \u2014 Amazon Prime. People think Jeff Bezos invented it? He didn\u2019t invent it! He read the biography of John D. Rockefeller! Rockefeller invented it all! He did it all! He gave away the razors to sell the razor blades, he\u2019s the first guy to realize that you have to form a cartel or you have to form some kind of understanding of scarcity. If there\u2019s no scarcity, there\u2019s so much volatility that the market is chaotically destructive. So you had the world\u2019s first serious energy network there, and it\u2019s such a powerful network that 100 years after Rockefeller\u2019s dead, those companies are still around, worth $1 Trillion! They\u2019re still instrumental!"}

Like people would \u2014 you talk about scarcity. The problem with using a commodity as money is when the price goes up, people produce too much of it! Well so he \u2014 it was a very inefficient industry with massive volatility, and so he consolidated it to drop the volatility so that they could standardize every component along the way! So that he could drive to a lower energy level, a more efficient energy system. Ultimately, if you want to look at the human condition \u2014 you ever get on one of those rowing machines and you row as hard as you can for an hour, and a kilowatt-hour is hard to come by! You start to think \u2014 if I rowed all day long and I was an Olympic-level rower, I think the sum total of my effort is like 29 cents? Like, if you calculate the value of all of your human effort in modern energy cost? A quarter? A nickel \u2014 some people couldn\u2019t even do a nickel worth of work, right? And you think about where we got to, and we got through to that by channeling this energy, and it must be 1,000x, 10,000x more energy! In fact just a general theme you see everywhere where there\u2019s an explosion of innovation and an explosion of vitality, somebody tapped into a 1,000x more energy or figured out how to deliver the energy! Oil was originally all about kerosene and lighting, and then heating, and then of course the automobile shot it up by a factor of 10 and that was the killer app! But if you go on to some other industrial-era robber baron networks \u2014 here\u2019s an interesting one: Kraft, Hershey\u2019s, and Post Cereal. They\u2019re technology companies! People don\u2019t think of \u2019em as that! Before they came along, there was no breakfast. People didn\u2019t eat breakfast! Kraft and Post figured out how to box corn flakes, and what they did is they stabilized food energy and put it into a container that didn\u2019t bleed the energy, that didn\u2019t leak energy! If I give you a bottle full of tomato sauce, and I just make it in my kitchen, and you put it in your refrigerator, it will spoil over some period of time. How much? Well, there\u2019s bacteria in it. The origin of branding \u2014 the Kraft brand, the Hershey\u2019s brand, or whatever brand \u2014 the origin of branding is I make it in a clean room, hermetically sealed. Everybody has to clean up, scrub down, sterilize, get the bacteria off, I have machines to load the can, to seal the can, to seal the bottle. I stamp it with my brand! The #1 value proposition wasn\u2019t, It\u2019s good ketchup! Or it\u2019s good tomatoes or good soup or good whatever! The #1 value proposition is it\u2019s not gonna kill you! You ever actually make some leftovers and leave it in your refrigerator for 2 months and eat it? Here\u2019s a better one: why don\u2019t you make something in your kitchen, and then leave it in your closet for 2 months without a refrigerator, because they didn\u2019t have refrigerators! Frozen food came along later! And Marjorie Merriweather Post became one of the richest women of the century, a) because her father gave her Post Cereal, and they were able to stabilize starch in a box at room temperature, and then b) because she bought the first frozen food company, and she realized the ability to actually freeze food was gonna be a game-changer! And before that, no one had ever frozen food before! You think they\u2019re not technologists? It\u2019s a food energy company!"}

Can I deliver electricity from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan? Yes! When it gets to you, how long can you store it in your battery? It bleeds 2% a month! You\u2019ll probably lose it all in the year. Can I ship food from Detroit to Grand Rapids? Yeah. When it gets there, how long can you store it in your cellar? A day? A week? If the answer\u2019s 2 weeks, there\u2019s no national business there! There\u2019s no national brand! The answer needs to be 3 months or 6 months \u2014 now there\u2019s a national brand! Now it matters! So these guys that were launching these businesses, they were really launching clean room manufacturing plants that captured energy or something of value. They were stores of value, Robert! A store of value that would not decay or bleed due to bacterial infestation or spoilage. And because of that, the brand became important, just like the Standard brand was important \u2014 the kerosene\u2019s not gonna explode \u2014 it\u2019s clean, right? Is the gasoline clean? Is the ketchup clean? You go to Hershey, Pennsylvania, they got a factory \u2014 it\u2019s a work of art! It\u2019s more complicated than most computer programs! They wrote a computer program in steel! Like, don\u2019t eff that up, right? There\u2019s no version 2 coming \u2014 write your program in an analog computer welded in steel that takes up a football field \u2014 that\u2019s what they did!

Maybe it\u2019s the first time someone came up with a way to cryptographically brand a security! Which is an interesting idea! Now with regard to businesses, I would say that all of the great businesses, the growth companies, were all technology companies\u2014in their time. And eventually, almost by definition, they stop growing when they\u2019re no longer cutting edge technology companies, right? There are other businesses that are more like rent-seeking businesses, or they\u2019re concessions. The guy that sells bottled water in the shadow of the Notre Dame Cathedral, that\u2019s a business \u2014 it relies upon political largesse, maybe there\u2019s a real estate business, right? I own that real estate, and then I sell you water or lemonade on that real estate. There are those kind of businesses. But the growth companies \u2014 Standard Oil was a growth company, U.S. Steel, Boeing, IBM \u2014 in that period when they\u2019re growing, they\u2019re a technology company. And that means that all growth stocks are technology companies by definition! You can buy another stock that\u2019s not a growth company or a non-tech company, but it\u2019s probably not a growth stock! In order to grow a non-technology company, you could then make the assertion that you\u2019re gonna need to do financial engineering, like roll-ups \u2014 like I\u2019m gonna buy every McDonald\u2019s or every restaurant across the country with debt, maybe that\u2019s a way to grow it! Or you need a concession from a regulator! It\u2019s now illegal for you \u2014 I\u2019m the only person that can operate airports in the United States! You can grow that way. I need a concession, a political concession, and I suppose there\u2019s a place for innovative marketing, but I\u2019m not \u2014 if there\u2019s not a compelling technology breakthrough, I\u2019m just not a big fan of the marketing thing, you know? Except for, if the marketing breakthrough comes about due to technology, for example, I created a company that got famous because I\u2019m famous on Twitter and YouTube \u2014 that\u2019s not a bad idea! I\u2019m the best marketer on the new media \u2014 maybe that can work. But at the end of the day, those are not gonna be $1 Trillion \u2014 you know, in their day, if the dollar\u2019s debased by a factor of 100, at least, well John D. Rockefeller was worth $300-$400 Million in his money! Multiply it by 100, you know? Multiply it by 200! He got to be worth $1 Billion I think! So he probably was worth $200\u2013250 Billion in his money, and that was in a day where you didn\u2019t have access to all the deflationary tech services that are effectively free! So relatively speaking they had extraordinary power, but they were all technology capitalists. It\u2019s important at this point for us to just look at the impact steel and aluminum through this entire era. [55:43] Carnegie created an empire based on steel, and Andrew Mellon\u2019s empire was substantially based on aluminum and aluminum alcoa. Steel is an elemental force for the civil engineering industry, and aluminum became that elemental force for aviation! Without steel, really there is no modern city! You build a building in wood, it\u2019s 2 stories. Build a building in bricks or masonry, it\u2019s 5 stories max. In order to create New York or London or any great city, you need steel and you need of course, an elevator! Straightforward things, but of the two of them, steel is the harder development. The elevator you can probably figure out \u2014 it\u2019s a counter-weight on a pulley. Whereas steel is iron laced with carbon, and it\u2019s really hard! How hard? Think about how complicated it is in order to refine steel and shape steel when it\u2019s molten, and it melts through just about anything you might put it in, or on! If you read any books on steel like American Steel I think by Richard Preston about Nucor, they talk about steel refinery blow-outs! If you actually have an accident in a steel refinery and if the molten steel falls on the concrete, there\u2019s water vapor in the concrete! So molten steel superheats the water vapor, and what happens when water vapor gets hot, or water gets hot? It expands! Explodes! Molten steel on concrete turns the entire refinery into a bomb, and it blows up, and it kills everybody for 100 meters in every direction! So technology, or not technology? Harder technology \u2014 everybody thinks they\u2019re in a technology business today. Nobody deals with technology that\u2019s as dangerous and as tricky as what Carnegie and those early steel refineries were dealing with! Or the DuPonts handling nitroglycerin! Like, what do you think happens when you mishandle nitroglycerin? [58:31] When you mishandle crypto, you lose some money. When you mishandle nitroglycerin, everything gets blown up \u2014 again, for half a mile in every direction! And aluminum, again, not so easy either! So these are really difficult technologies, but really elemental, because the difference between steel and no steel is, do you build a 100-story skyscraper? I guess you could say, you might do something with iron, but iron\u2019s just got problems! Steel is the perfect material for civil engineering! It\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s got extraordinary tensile strength, if you paint it or protect it from corrosion, it will last forever! Literally forever, Robert! In fact, if you build a steel ship and you punch a hole in it, you can weld the hold with another piece of steel, and the weld will be stronger than the original cold-rolled steel. It\u2019s that strong! So in the world of strong \u2014 this is the strongest of strong materials! It\u2019s strong, it\u2019s cheap, Carnegie figured it out \u2014 they built every bridge with it! No steel \u2014 no bridges! No bridges \u2014 no Manhattan! Think about what happens if you blow up the bridges in Manhattan? Everybody would starve to death! You can\u2019t even get the food in fast enough! And of course, you can\u2019t hold the skyscrapers. So all modern civil engineering is based on steel. So then along comes aviation, and they try to build a plane with steel \u2014 what happens? You ever see a steel airplane?"}

Standard Oil was an energy network! The railroads are energy networks! By the way, no railroad \u2014 no tanker car with energy on it, right? The railroad is the energy network moving the oil around! The airplanes \u2014 another energy network \u2014 moving high frequency cargo around, and information around. And each one of them build on another one. And then the food networks. The result of all of them is, there are large corporations and huge opportunities for wealth creation, if you get to the node of the network! One last point on the Steel Age before we move on that\u2019s worth noting is: average life expectancy at 1900 is 50 in America! It was 70 under the Romans, it was 30 in the Dark Ages, it might have been 32\u201333 in the Revolutionary War in the US. We crawl back up to 50, and then by 1950, it\u2019s 70! And so probably the most rapid expansion in the quality of life in thousands of years is in this 50 years from 1900\u20131950, because of the conquest of infectious diseases! And that\u2019s all really a function of discovering the science of microbes and sterilization \u2014 understanding that you need to be sterile. And then the second is antibiotics. And those two things together were extraordinary! Antibiotics alone and Penicillin is responsible for the defeat of Tuberculosis, and Tuberculosis killed a billion people! The White Plague! When you caught Tuberculosis it was a death sentence! I think it killed Chopin \u2014 it killed all sorts of people! A billion people \u2014 more than any war! [1:04:27] And of course, in this particular case, if you look at history books on the 20th century, they give it like 2 paragraphs! If you were weighting the text based on the significance of what happened, something like half of all the history of the 20th century ought to be just about Penicillin, antibiotics, and sterilization \u2014 half! And everything else can be the other half! But in fact it\u2019s not even 0.01%. The only measurable mortality rate in the 20th century is the flu epidemic around 1920 where you could see a blip. You can\u2019t see an impact on the average life expectancy of any other event \u2014 including all the wars \u2014 World War I doesn\u2019t register, World War II doesn\u2019t register. It\u2019s kind of like, the impact of technology, of modern medicine and antibiotics and networks and cheap energy and sterilization and sanitation and [inaudible]. The impact of that so dwarfs every political thing that took place in the century that what you really got is I think it\u2019s just a small blip in 1920. And that was like, different estimates: 100 million people died, people say as much as 10\u201320% of the population died in that 1\u20132 year time frame, and they\u2019re still debating what that is, but it\u2019s the only event you can see on the chart, and all of the activities of all the politicians and all the ideologies and everything we fought over, turned out to be not as relevant as defeating Tuberculosis!"}

{"link": "https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-what-is-money/the-saylor-series-episode-2-ftSvWp_4gXP/", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 2 | The Rise of Man through the Dark and Steel Ages", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:08:08]: Alright guys, Episode 2! So good! We\u2019re making progress, we\u2019ve now seen Man rise through Stone Age, Iron Age, regressed into the Dark Ages, and then finally progress into the Steel Age. And this leads us into the Industrial Revolution, to where we are today, which is the Information Age! So I really appreciated Saylor\u2019s perspectives on this! I thought it was interesting that we take so much for granted today! We really think that all of these modern miracles generated by markets are a given, but if we look at the Dark Ages and realize that one key misstep can send us sliding back thousands of years, I think it\u2019s a great lesson to deeply absorb! And realize that none of this is promised! And he made the point clear with the boot print, right? The idea of the printing press was evident to anyone who had ever seen a footprint or a boot print, yet for some reason it took us a really long time to commercialize it and realize its revolutionary potential! [1:09:26] Also when he pointed to Trajan, the guy from 100 A.D., the statue of Trajan of holding the globe, this spherical world in his hand in 100 A.D., yet fast forward to 1,400 A.D. and there\u2019s people in Europe pre-Columbus that still think the world is flat! It\u2019s so interesting to me that these ideas \u2014 as power as they are \u2014 they can be missed! We can hurt ourselves by not paying attention. And not just at an individual level, but really at a civilizational level. Saylor might call that the fire of truth \u2014 when you let the fire of truth be extinguished, society can regress into falsehood. The other interesting point was the Native Americans with the pottery wheel. They had this device for who knows how many hundreds of years, but no one had figured out to turn it on its side. You realize all of the mechanical potential of the wheel! The wheelbarrow, the wagon, even things like the train. They all use the wheel to overcome frictions for terrestrial motion. And I thought that was an interesting example of how some of our most important innovations can just be hidden in plain sight, frankly! And this points towards Bitcoin for me in that so many people know there\u2019s something wrong in the world. They sense there\u2019s something really deeply wrong in the world today, but very few people understand how broken the money is, and how much that contributes to the socioeconomic problems we\u2019re seeing in the world over! So in that way I kind of think the problem and the solution are hidden in plain sight, so to speak! In that we need to fix the money to fix many problems in the world. And we got into the discussion about smugglers. So the definition of a smuggler, which sounds like a criminal actor, is really just someone trying to protect their self-interest! They\u2019re someone that wants to conduct commerce through a port and not give away half of their stuff, as Saylor said! And that\u2019s actually where we get the term free port. The term free port means that you can dock there without having half your stuff [inaudible 1:12:06] confiscated. And that leads us to the really important role that gatekeepers have played throughout history. Whatever local monopoly on violence existed, they always wielded that monopoly to extract value or rents or tax from those conducting business and creating economic surplus in their guarded territory. That\u2019s been kind of the name of the game throughout human history, and that\u2019s why we have the two adages: Death and Taxes. Anywhere you go to conduct business, you\u2019re gonna get taxed, and we\u2019re all mortal, we all die. So governments have always used the weapon of the law as an instrument of plunder. It\u2019s how they generate revenue, is maximally extracting wealth from those that do business in their territory, but it\u2019s a parasitic relationship, and if you look in the domain of biology, parasites actually don\u2019t tax their hosts to tax, that would actually be counter to their own self-interest! They want to extract maximum value, but in a way that maintains the host\u2019s longevity. So it\u2019s kind of like establishing monopoly profits in the economics sense. There\u2019s a very particular point on the price curve where the monopolist sets their price to optimize their own profits, which isn\u2019t enough profits to kill the consumer and force them not to be able to pay for it, and it\u2019s not a low price like we\u2019ve seen in free market competition, but it\u2019s right at this peak point! Which I thought was pretty interesting that we were able to see governments in that light! And that\u2019s why history has this distinct pattern of might is right. Like, people have been competing to be the head gatekeeper, and this can be governmental, this can be religious, because it gives them the path of least resistance if you will for extracting value and becoming wealthy. And indeed these were the first people to become wealthy in the world were people that were able to specialize in violence, or just specialize in religion to establish monopolies on local commerce or local police systems. And that points to the intimate relationship between government and religion and you know the defining feature of Western civilization today is the separation of church and state. That was how we have secular society, was a decoupling of those two institutions. And if we look at say a modern city like New York, I thought the point was great that those skyscrapers are constructed from the value that is extracted by financial intermediaries. Saylor gave the example of two bond traders in adjacent buildings driving most of the volume in a market, and they both get to scrape their vig, their 1\u20132%. It reminds me of the hotels in Vegas, the old joke is like the buildings aren\u2019t built by winning gamblers! The nature of being an intermediary is that you get to extract perpetual profits basically, from anyone doing business within your network! And that\u2019s what money is, right? It\u2019s a network of trust, and that\u2019s why the state has always fought to control and monopolize it because it gives them essentially unlimited power and wealth to be able to confiscate that from the entirety of their citizens. [1:16:04] That\u2019s what tax is, that\u2019s what a rent is \u2014 not a rent like you pay monthly for your apartment, but rent in the economic sense is it is the intermediary or group preserving peace in that area \u2014 they get to siphon value off of it for the privilege of protection. And it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing! The problem with it is when it\u2019s priced at a non-consensual rate. When you have to pay 40% taxes to the government and you don\u2019t have any bargaining power in that relationship, that\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s when you go away from free market competition and towards monopolization. And that\u2019s what creates so many problems in the world! And then when we shifted the discussion and started looking at standardized containers, we talked about that standardized container that unites at the back of a semi-truck or that now ship across the ocean. When we started talking about the value again there of standardization \u2014 which we touched on a lot of this in Episode 1, when we looked at ancient Romans \u2014 when we are able to compress, I guess you could say that protocols and standardization compress confusion, because there\u2019s less optionality, so everyone knows the language. Everyone knows exactly what to expect, so you\u2019re able to execute actions very quickly and efficiently. And this creates a lot of economic surplus, right? This frees up a lot of time and resources, which are harnessed as well. They can be reallocated to other things! So that is how we collapse fixed cost, is by standardization! And we\u2019ll talk about this more in a bit that the pattern I see emerging is that at the beginning of an industry, it\u2019s almost as if \u2014 if there\u2019s not a natural monopoly, there\u2019s typically attempted to be imposed a legal monopoly, and this can have some short-run benefit because it establishes standards, but it\u2019s at the long run detrimental to the market because again the monopolist is essentially extracting wealth from other market participants. So when we looked at empires, I love how Saylor painted that the #1 export of an empire is security! That\u2019s what the US is today \u2014 we\u2019re the imperialist that runs the world, we export security. If you look at a map of how many US military bases there are worldwide, we\u2019re basically everywhere except Russia and China! And it\u2019s interesting to me how Bitcoin fits into that picture, because Bitcoin\u2019s #1 value proposition is security! It\u2019s security of your time and energy in a medium that cannot be compromised! As Saylor described that it\u2019s like a technology \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 for securitizing your time and energy behind an impenetrable wall of encrypted energy. So it\u2019s a very unique tool in that for the first time in history we have a place to put our life force or our wealth that is independent of any political happenings in the world! It\u2019s an apolitical money, which is very essential to its value proposition! [1:19:51] Although Bitcoin clearly has a huge relationship with security, it clearly hasn\u2019t solved physical security \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s not a force field or anything like that \u2014 it does have some interesting potential implications in that because it\u2019s programmatic, you could program a payment to be issued to a gatekeeper, half before you pass the gate (whatever the gate may be whether this is a border or anything that a gatekeeper does) and then program such that they receive half the payment after so it can actually reduce the incentives to violence, and increase the incentives to cooperation! So it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin fits into the empires of the future. And then we went into the Steel Age, which steel is just a fascinating thing! It\u2019s this raw material for building these networks in a really permanent fashion! Again if we looked at what people are \u2014 people are, as I say in some of my writing \u2014 we\u2019re the networked species! We dominate the planet with our wits! Because of our ability to abstract, to tell stories like money, like nation states, like human rights, and that entire thesis is encapsulated really well in the book Sapiens if you haven\u2019t read that! And our ability to abstract these stories, orient ourselves around them and then communicate about them very precisely and very quickly! That\u2019s what lets us function almost as a single, harmonious organism, which you could say the world economy is! We\u2019re communicating with words and prices and shifting the allocation of resources to the highest and best use, at least in a purely free market \u2014 central banking clearly distorts a lot of that! And in that context, steel was critical to building out kinetic networks. The railroad, the ability to move people and military assets 1,000x or 10,000x more cheaply across land! Saylor was making the point that wars were won and lost based on the successful construction of railroads. And this drove an interconnectivity of people and cities across land. So it\u2019s one of these primordial networks for civilization. And behind that were the roads built by the Romans! And that took us to John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. I thought the point was great about [white 1:22:58], again before we figured out how to harness oil \u2014 oil being this compressed energy source from ancient sunlight. Sunlight that\u2019s fallen on the Earth for tens of thousands or millions of years and has been compressed into its subterranean layers that we\u2019re then able to harness to radically increase our productivity as we\u2019ve seen in the Industrial Age. Before that, before we figured out oil, we\u2019re literally going to sea hunting whales, harpooning whales, to harvest their blubber for candlelight! So the productivity \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen the math on this before, I can\u2019t quote it exactly \u2014 but the amount of energy necessarily to produce a single lumen, which would be a unit of light radiance going from needing to hunt whales to produce candles to harnessing oil \u2014 again it was orders of magnitude more cheap to be able to create light! Oil basically was this, like fire almost, this primary energy network that we were able to tap and just radically accelerate how quickly the economy producing wealth and new things and new innovations! So again if we consider that we\u2019re channeling energy across our intellect to create new useful things, it\u2019s as if our intellect hit this new really potent source of energy when we figured out oil! And Rockefeller, he captured the entire value strain. He built out the logistics network, he had the train cars, the container ships, the trucks. Saylor made the point he was giving away the furnaces away for free so he had the freemium model \u2014 he was giving away the furnaces to sell the oil, so to speak. And he originated this cartel model of owning the whole supply chain, so he could standardize the industry which I thought was super interesting! Because again we\u2019re back to standardization where a monopolist can come in and lay out this singular unitary plan to mute the volatility, to mute the competition, which is long term bad, but short term sort of a benefit in that now that monopolist gets to set standards. He can create standards that everyone else will be forced to operate on \u2014 if done correctly \u2014 forever! He almost gets to be the incipient of the path dependence of the network that he\u2019s creating. And so the thing that comes to mind is monopolies serving this function perhaps of muting volatility in the early stages of an industry\u2019s development to establish standards which then commoditizes the space and \u2014 assuming you can remove that monopoly after its served its function setting the standards \u2014 then you let free market competition take hold on those standards, and it\u2019s more beneficial! Versus, if you just set out in the beginning with pure free market competition, then it\u2019s hard to get the industry to interoperate well because of the lack of standards! So it\u2019s a bit of a mind-twist for me, but the old comes to mind, If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far, go together. It\u2019s as if a monopolistic single unitary plan enables you to go fast, enables you to build out an industry really quickly, even in the Information Age today \u2014 I think we\u2019re very early \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing the monopolists take a big lead, right? Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. But over time I would suspect that the standards that they\u2019ve been setting will start to be opened up to more free market competition, and we\u2019ll see the de-monopolization of this space and with that the declining cost, which then, again, frees up all this economic abundance that Man can allocate towards the next wave of innovation! So it\u2019s a lot to think about there, but it seems like there\u2019s some natural interplay between monopolistic and free market competition! And Rockefeller figuring out standardizing oil led to Henry Ford\u2019s production of the automobile. And the automobile as Saylor said was the killer app of oil. When we think about the automobile it\u2019s like, What was invented? We think it\u2019s just this vehicle of getting us from A to B, but it enabled, all of a sudden, the density of the city, the economic network density of the city to be a reality, because then people could commute into the city and commute out! It created a lot of the pollution we see in the world today. It changed people\u2019s self-identity, right? The car is an avatar of who we are! People often use automobiles today as kind of a status symbol. So it\u2019s just a total game-changer. The automobile is again one of those innovations that sort of sprung out from the mastering of the oil energy network. I thought it was interesting too how Rockefeller was basically the most wealthy guy in history. Saylor made the point that he was worth over $200 Billion of today\u2019s dollars, but Rockefeller died in 1937. The refrigerator wasn\u2019t even commercialized until early 1920s. So this is a guy \u2014 the richest guy in the world \u2014 didn\u2019t even have a refrigerator! So if you today have a refrigerator, you in some ways are more wealthy than John D. Rockefeller was! [1:29:16] You know, a little less than a hundred years ago. And that I think is just a testament to the abundance created by free markets, right? Every living generation \u2014 assuming we\u2019re optimizing for productivity improvement \u2014 is head and shoulders above the prior generation, even the richest of the prior generation! And then we got into a discussion about Kraft, Hershey\u2019s, and Post foods \u2014 I never thought about this before! That the business they were in was actually selling stabilized energy! Like, food is inherently unstable, it doesn\u2019t keep well, especially before the invention of the refrigerator, and these innovators figured out basically how to stabilize food energy at room temperature! And the value proposition they were selling was that their food doesn\u2019t kill you! Which I thought was just great! It\u2019s like, again they were technologists! We think of it as food, today it\u2019s no big deal \u2014 we go to the grocery and we buy boxes or cans or bottles of whatever we want \u2014 but this was a major breakthrough for supporting larger populations like we have in the world today! It reminds me of the certification function on coinage and bills too, because Saylor made the point \u2014 I\u2019ve never thought of a brand like this \u2014 that the brand was, This food won\u2019t kill you! Just like a gold coin stamped by a government or a private certification business was saying, This is 1 ounce of gold! Or this is 10 ounces of silver! Or whatever it was. So it\u2019s a trust thing! You learn to trust the brand to represent what it says it is! And then also in food, frozen food was a total game-changer, like the fact that we could suck all the entropy out of food and keep it for extremely long periods of time, just allowed us to accumulate this savings of food! We all take it for granted today, but a freezer and a refrigerator? We should just stop in awe of our freezer and refrigerator every day and just think about how amazing it is that we figured out a way to suck the entropy out of food and store food energy over extremely long periods of time! In that context in a monetary sense, we could say that fiat currency is a high-entropy storage device. It leaks a lot! It suffers from spoilage over time, whereas Bitcoin could be considered the deep freeze, the absolute zero of storing monetary energy! It sucks all the entropy out of it, and you know that you\u2019ll own a guaranteed fraction of the money supply for all time! So that analogy was interesting to me as well. I liked how he talked about food factories being \u2014 again they were technologists \u2014 they were computer programs written in steel! So one end of this program you put eggs and flour and milk or whatever it is and at the other end of this steel computer program it outputs cookies! That you can then box, wrap in plastic, put it on the shelf and they last for a year or whatever the number is! This is a totally new and unique way to look at food, and consumer packaged goods in general! And in that way they were stores of value, right? Food, this CPG industry was in the business of storing value! They\u2019re storing food energy as value and selling it, and they were able to accomplish that through hyper-sanitation. So they\u2019re removing all of the detritus and any uncleanliness from the food packaging process, and in doing so they\u2019re able to output a product that was guaranteed to last for a fixed amount of time! And the analogy there to Bitcoin being this hyper-sanitized ledger, right? All of the nodes are all checking, and the miners are all checking one another\u2019s work to make sure it\u2019s being done consistent with the rules of the protocol, which are 100% open and transparent to everyone! And that\u2019s what makes it this ultimate preservation device of monetary energy! So just mind-blowing comparisons between consumer food products and Bitcoin! And in that way, Saylor hit this on the head, I saw the brand, the concept of a brand, in a new way. I used to think a brand was just a company\u2019s logo and reputation, but to his point, the brand was the certification saying, This product is what it says it is \u2014 you can trust the reputation of this group! Particularly, this food won\u2019t kill you! Something that\u2019s pretty important! Something that you\u2019re gonna eat and put into your body, you can reliably trust this brand that it won\u2019t kill you! The producers are trading on their own reputation, if you will. I thought he just hit the button right on the head when he said, In that sense Bitcoin is the best branded asset in history, because Bitcoin does do exactly what it says it will do! Nothing less, nothing more! And there\u2019s no element of human corruption that can change that! You could install a new CEO of Kraft foods and he could say, To hell with the customer! I\u2019m gonna start putting rat poison in my cheese crackers or whatever, right? He can do some outlandish stuff to ruin the reputation of the business! But Bitcoin is this leaderless institution that just runs the rules of the protocol and it doesn\u2019t change, it doesn\u2019t bend! So that was just mind-blowing to me, and something that I\u2019ll be thinking about for a really long time! Then we got into steel, with Andrew Carnegie mastering this ultimate raw material for civil engineering. Saylor made the point: steel was cheap, high tensile strength, if you paint it it basically lasts forever, so it\u2019s non-corrosive as long as you seal it off from air and water, and if you damage it and decide to repair it with a weld, the welding is actually stronger than the original weld itself! So again, another one of these fundamental breakthroughs in raw materials that supported higher civilizational advance! Then we talked about aviation. Clearly steel was good for a lot of things but no good for aviation because it was too heavy so we had to figure out aluminum. My epiphany here was that so much was riding on these raw material breakthroughs! We\u2019re discovering new foundation elements to society, and there\u2019s a lot of upstream consequences that we can\u2019t even imagine! When someone figured out steel, who knew we were to figure out cities and then figure out aluminum, aviation, and then say fiber optics encircling the planet, the Internet, YouTube! It\u2019s just these layers of innovation and from the point of innovation it\u2019s impossible frankly to see where it\u2019s going to go, so it unlocks all this potential human ingenuity to discover all these other things with kind of a cascading effect! So no steel \u2014 no city! No aluminum \u2014 no aviation! Just those two! We\u2019ll just stop there! If we had not city, and we had no aviation, how much of the world would we not have today? I mean of you have flown? How many of you have lived in a city? It\u2019s really hard to fathom how much just these two raw material breakthroughs have changed our lives! In my mind, it all comes down to increasing the energetic or network density, so we\u2019re increasing the possibility of exchange. We increased the cost of\u2014the economic and population density of a city increases exchange within that city, so it\u2019s pumping out more ideas and innovations. And there\u2019s great books on this. I think it\u2019s called The Serendipity of the City, where it talks about this relationship between the population density, and innovation. The more population density there is, the more innovation tends to come out of it! Then in aviation\u2019s sense, it\u2019s about overcoming the frictions to free exchange. Most people more than 200 years ago would really never leave say a 30-mile radius of where they\u2019re born, give or take. Maybe those numbers are wrong but you get the point: the world has opened up as a result of aviation! I mean you can go anywhere in the world now within a day! Anywhere in the world. It used to take settlers in the US, what, 3\u20134 months to cross the continent, if you didn\u2019t die from disease or whatever! Again it just points towards the importance of free exchange and how these raw material breakthroughs support more network density which accelerates free exchange even more and leads to more and more breakthroughs in a cascading fashion! And the analogy I like there is that Bitcoin kind of is like financial steel, right? It\u2019s just the best tool for the job, and it just works! It doesn\u2019t bend, it doesn\u2019t break, it just is an absolutely perfected monetary technology, and it\u2019s steel but it also has wings \u2014 you can just send it anywhere, you can store it in your mind or in a computer anywhere. So it has all this flexibility too. It could be programmed to do different things, and you can build different features and modules on top of the protocol and you can build higher layer protocols. It\u2019s just one of those type of breakthroughs, a raw material/network breakthrough. So just a lot to think about there. Finally we talked about the conquest of infectious diseases which clearly we haven\u2019t conquered all of them but we\u2019ve done a lot. Saylor made the point that these breakthroughs are the best amplifiers of life expectancy ever! Curing Tuberculosis, which killed a billion people, that had an immediate impact on the life expectancy curve, which World War I and World War II were just a blip. So it makes the point that technology is increasingly more of a variable on our progress. It\u2019s almost like technology is becoming exponentially more important to us as we innovate further! Which gets us into the Information Age. The wars which are more of like political actions \u2014 these matter much less in the long scheme of human history. But, there\u2019s a distortion in the history books, right? If you go to read history, you\u2019re gonna read 99 pages about World War I and World War II \u2014 maybe 9,900 pages \u2014 for every page you read about Tuberculosis. So there\u2019s this asymmetry in terms of how important the breakthrough is, versus how much is written about, which I thought was fascinating! And Penicillin, that breakthrough that increased our life expectancy so much, it was accidental! Again as Taleb would say, tinkering is an antifragile process. So the more entropy or uncertainty or randomness we can introduce to the process, the more breakthroughs we have \u2014 that can be accidental at times! Penicillin was a Mycelium or a fungus left in a sink overnight, and something grew on it, someone tested it, someone figured out, Holy crap! Holy cow! This thing cures disease, an infection! And it just radically changed the world, right? One of the most important discoveries in the history of Man \u2014 from an accident! So I think it just points to what we need to optimize society for, which is: free exchange and experimentation \u2014 that\u2019s how we create the wealth in the world, that\u2019s how we solve problems, that\u2019s how we increase life expectancy! So that was a killer episode! I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I did! And we\u2019ll see you back soon for Episode 3!"}

Bitcoin is channeling human ingenuity into making it better, and every commodity is channeling human energy into making it worse.

Welcome to Episode 1 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! I\u2019m your host, Robert Breedlove, and our purpose in this show in general is the pursuit of truth. We\u2019re gonna explore many topics in depth, and many of them will take us down to the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole, by pursuing what I call is the rabbit! And the rabbit is that question \u2014 that all-important question \u2014 \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d And this question is a seemingly inexhaustible generator of answers that have continuously reshaped my perspectives on the world. And I think they will for you as well. Our first episode is part of a long series with Michael Saylor. He\u2019s the CEO of Microstrategy. Michael is the latest and arguably the greatest proponent of Bitcoin, and an ally of this space in its battle for truth and freedom in the world. And Microstrategy is a NASDAQ-listed business intelligence firm, so Michael has very deep experience in the fields of technology, network architecture \u2014 things like this. And in fact, he was actually educated in the domain of scientific paradigm shifts and the impact of technology on civilization. And ten years ago, Michael actually wrote a book called The Mobile Wave, that depicted many of the impacts that he saw FAANG stocks would have on the world: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. He had laid out a case \u2014 an investment case, largely \u2014 for these companies, and their dominance in the global marketplace. And clearly over the past ten years\u2014as we sit down in 2020 \u2014 those stocks have been stand-out performers and have become in many ways the new dominant monopolies in the world today. So Michael has a very deep understanding of these topics that I think actually predisposed him to gaining a rapid understanding of Bitcoin. And as you\u2019ll see \u2014 or as you may have heard in other interviews \u2014 he really entered the Bitcoin space in 2020 and got very deep into the rabbit hole very quickly, in the wake of the COVID global lockdown situation! So Michael\u2019s a very intelligent guy, very high energy, very hard working, and I think his acceleration into the Bitcoin rabbit hole also demonstrates that a lot of this trail has been blazed for him. So a lot of Bitcoin maximalists have laid the foundation for others to gain a more rapid and clear understanding of the impact of Bitcoin. In the wake of that as you all probably know \u2014 you may have not heard \u2014 Michael\u2019s firm, Microstrategy, actually named Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. They initially invested $425 Million into Bitcoin, and that Michael personally disclosed that he holds about 17,000 Bitcoin himself, so he\u2019s got a lot of skin in the game to say the least! And I think you\u2019ll see why as we go through some of this! So in this, what we\u2019re calling The Saylor Series, we\u2019re gonna start from the first principles of energy, of anthropology, of technology, and really build a solid foundation for really gaining a deep understanding of Bitcoin\u2019s potential impact on the world. And Michael and I, to craft this series, we iterated on its discussion framework, and we finally arrived at his overarching thesis \u2014 which he was kind enough to lay out in very sophisticated form \u2014 and he goes very deep on the topics we\u2019ve laid out here, which starts very early, like Stone Age, and we go all the way into modernity! So this is a long narrative arc that\u2019s super fascinating, very interesting stuff, and clearly, it takes us some time to build up to Bitcoin, but the journey itself is purposeful and it\u2019s well worth it! So we divided the content itself into time-stamped chapters and sub-chapters which we\u2019ve chopped into a bunch of episodes. Each episode is comprised of chapters, and then two of those chapters are sub-chapters. We\u2019ll have time-stamps available both in the video bar and in the description to the video. And the early episodes will include a lot of Michael talking \u2014 so a lot of him speaking solo about his bedrock thesis on energy, anthropology, technology, things like this! And then as we build into modernity and to Bitcoin, it will become much more of a dialogue conversation as we go back and forth about Bitcoin and things of that nature. So I realize this is really long form content, but I assure you, I can promise you, you\u2019re gonna find it deeply meaningful! I myself found the feeling of chills at times, there were various epiphanies I had going through this which I\u2019ll articulate in some of the outros to the episodes. But this was just dynamite content! And I think it\u2019s a great view into the mind of Michael Saylor, and it makes a very powerful case for Bitcoin and how much it\u2019s going to reshape the world. So I promise you that you\u2019ll find \u2014 despite the time it may take you \u2014 you\u2019re gonna find this extremely intellectually satisfying, perhaps even philosophically satisfying. We go really deep on a lot of topics! So I hope you enjoy it! And I firmly believe the insights that come out of this will actually reshape your worldview! So if this is the kind of content you\u2019re interested in, and you\u2019re really interested in going deep and getting to truth, I think you\u2019re in the right place today! So with that, let\u2019s jump into Episode 1 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show!"}

And now we\u2019re in September! I look back on it, and certainly there\u2019s a lot of things I didn\u2019t expect. I joke with people, If I\u2019d gotten what I\u2019d wanted, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten what I needed. I wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as successful if at any point in time I\u2019d got what I wanted! I\u2019m sure this is not what I wanted when I started the year, and for a while I thought it wasn\u2019t terribly a good thing, but now as we move toward the end of the year, I see the silver lining here and I\u2019m glad these things happened, which is fascinating!"}

And so we were caught up in kind of two wars, in two dimensions. And then there\u2019s Lenin\u2019s quote: There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen. And this was that year in both of those ways! I\u2019m grateful that our company is an enterprise software company \u2014 our value proposition is we ship software to large enterprises to help them think better! And the value proposition is intact, even improved, by all of the changes this year. And our cost structure and our operational systems \u2014 the way we operate \u2014 were dramatically impacted, and we had to adjust. But I would say, this was the year that digital transformation went from being a bromide or a dalliance, to being something that you really had to internalize! This was the year that digital transformation really did transform you at the core of your being. I mean, it transformed my ideas about: money, sales, marketing and services, what product offering we should deliver to the market, the marketplace in the future in general. And it\u2019s been thrown around, it\u2019s been a buzzword for a decade \u2014 maybe for two or three decades!

So not only are things transforming much more quickly now, moving to digital much more quickly, but are likely to change even more quickly, exponentially so, into the future!

And I know you\u2019re a deep thinker, and I really appreciate the media work that you\u2019re doing, and the voice that you brought to the Bitcoin community. I\u2019d like to jump in, kind of like a first principles look at history, and what got us to today? What got us to this digital age that\u2019s changing so quickly? And where do we see it going? And I know you\u2019ve thought deeply about this, and maybe we could start just at the beginning, so to speak, with the story of technology?"}

Well I mean the phrase that runs through my head is, There has never been such a thing as a fair fight! Humans have been struggling for millions of years, right? In order to rise, first to become the apex predator in nature, but if you look at our struggle against nature, there\u2019s never been such a thing as a fair fight! I remember seeing eagles fly along a mountainside that\u2019ll hone in on a goat, and it focuses on a baby goat, not the parent goat \u2014 catches it from behind, grabs its foot, and drags it off a cliff, and then backs off and waits while the goat goes bang, bang, bang, and hits rocks every fifty feet and is smashed to death five-hundred feet below, where the eagle circles down, lands on the goat, eats it \u2014 leisurely! Nothing fair about it! You know, you feel sorry for the goat, and then you realize, this is not a human being! This is nature! It\u2019s not fair! Then you see lions \u2014 and it\u2019s not like one lion chases down one gazelle \u2014 it\u2019s eight lions chase sixty-seven gazelles into a channel with three other lions waiting! And one gazelle is forced to take the right side because it gets crowded out by the other sixty gazelle, and that one\u2014bam! \u2014 it\u2019s dead for no reason other than that it just happened to be on the right side of the herd, and there\u2019s nothing fair about it! Nature\u2019s not fair, and when you think about the plight of Man the amazing thing is we actually evolved to be the apex creature on this planet! Now because a single individual, on their own, has almost no chance! There\u2019s that scene in Jurassic Park, and there\u2019s the bully, and he just is mean to the little dinosaur creature, some kind of small raptor, and he\u2019s like the size of a little dog and he kicks it around, and he\u2019s a bully and a sadist! And there\u2019s this part where he gets trapped in the park\u2014he\u2019s walking and he sees that little creature, and it nips at its legs and he kicks it, and then he turns around and he sees its got a friend and there\u2019s two of \u2018em! And he looks around again and there\u2019s four of \u2018em! And then they jump on him and he knocks them off and there\u2019s sixteen of \u2018em! And then they all jump on him and he fights them off and he gets up and he runs and now there\u2019s thirty-two of them! The human being\u2014the modern American that lives in their world of shopping centers and cars and air-conditioned houses and locked doors and 911 and policemen they can call and feeling safety \u2014 they look at nature through a zoo! And they look through the bars and that\u2019s nature! Or it\u2019s in paintings and it\u2019s all just so romantic! Right? They don\u2019t have this view of nature! The view when there\u2019s sixty-four of those things \u2014 and the horrifying realization that that guy is as sure as dead! He\u2019s a dead man walking \u2014 he\u2019s gonna die! There\u2019s not a damn thing he can do, it doesn\u2019t matter if he has a bazooka, it doesn\u2019t matter if he has a machine gun! It doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 he\u2019s going to die! At some point, in the next 48 hours, he\u2019s going to fall asleep and they\u2019re going to eat him! And that\u2019s the human condition! So when you think about that 3 million years ago the first question is, How did we even make it here? It\u2019s pretty obvious that, in that circumstance, if you\u2019re alone \u2014 you\u2019re dead. You\u2019re gonna have to have someone guard your back. And my heart goes out to that Adam and Eve wherever they were \u2014 you needed two, three four \u2014 you needed a tribe. You needed someone to watch, because when you fall asleep, something is going to eat you! Watch a pack of wolves hunt! The one that kills you? Isn\u2019t attacking from the front! You\u2019re not going to get to fight it off! It\u2019s gonna be an asymmetric attack from the rear, while you\u2019re asleep! And so, the importance of human beings using their brains and thinking is incredibly important! And you start to think about \u2014 how do we survive in a hostile universe? We have to figure out how we can get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And that takes us to the beginning of Man, so if I look back at Stone Age technology and you ask, How do we even emerge from this incredible, terrifying scrum? There\u2019s just key technologies that you decide you kind of like in a hurry! One of them is fire. One of them is missiles. One of them is hydraulics. There\u2019s a lot more that we could talk about, but if we start with fire: fire is like the prime energy network of the human race! It all started for us with channeling energy. Fire\u2019s a chain reaction where we\u2019re releasing a latent energy in matter \u2014 we\u2019re converting matter into energy."}

Prometheus is to Satoshi as fire is to Bitcoin! Bitcoin\u2019s a fire! It\u2019s a fire in cyberspace! And most people don\u2019t realize it, but it has its antecedents, right? And fire came along first, and when you think about what it means \u2014 and most people don\u2019t necessarily think very hard about it , you always had it \u2014 if you\u2019re an individual, what can you do with fire? Well, you can start by starting a fire so you don\u2019t freeze to death! That\u2019s pretty useful! The fire will scare away the animals. So I start the fire, I can sleep around it, I can not freeze. I can also put it around my camp and maybe like a snake that would\u2019ve slithered in and eaten me will go away. I can scare away insects and smoke away insects with it \u2014 that\u2019s useful! I can hunt with it! I can start a fire, and I can drive the prey away from the fire. And if I\u2019m smart, I drive the prey from fire off the cliff! I wait for them to trip, I go to the bottom of the cliff, I find one that broke its neck. You ever get in a fight with a horse? Or a fight with a hippopotamus? Or an elephant? It\u2019s not gonna end well! This idea of heroic hand-to-hand combat is a great idea in the movies! It\u2019s an awful idea in reality! And if you went back a million years, you would find that your great-great-great-great-great-grandparent thought you were pretty frickin\u2019 stupid to fight hand-on-hand with anything or anyone! So I hunt with it \u2014 I cook with it! There\u2019s a lot of biologists and the paleotheorists that make a very compelling argument that human anatomy actually evolved because we mastered fire. And when you\u2019re cooking something, you\u2019re pre-digesting it. And if you pre-digest something, not only do you increase the scope of the foods that you can consume, you also accelerate and you also increase the efficiency with which you can convert that food into calories by a factor of 10:1 or 20:1! And if you can actually metabolize the food 10x more efficiently, your digestive tract shortens, and the energy that your body expends in order to digest food can be redirected \u2014 probably to your brain! Right? Animals that don\u2019t cook food have small brains! A human being that can cook food can have a very short digestive tract, can eat anything\u2014we\u2019re omnivores \u2014 we can go anywhere, we can metabolize calories that are very efficient. It only takes us 10 or 15 minutes a day to get all the calories we need! There are animals that have to graze all day to get the calories they need! So fire is critical for that. It\u2019s critical for seeing! You channel your fire and you can light up a cave, a camp, a tent, you can light up anywhere. And with seeing comes communicating. You ever travel through the ancient world you see they have all these watchtowers! The Romans built watchtowers! You put a fire in the tower, you can see it for miles and miles away! You create a signal system! A certain presumptive arrogance or ignorance among modern men \u2014 we think kind of everything worth doing was done in the past 2,000 years or 3,000 years. I kind of figure 100,000 years ago, people were doing all of this stuff! We might not have the writings of it, but they were pretty smart! So I\u2019m gonna use the fire for all of those things and eventually for communicating, but once I figure that out, I can use it for hardening, right? I can cook things, I can harden the tip of a spear, I can use it to work metals \u2014 eventually we used it to work metals, and that ushered us from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Fire is intrinsic to all sorts of manufacturing processes. And of course \u2014 I give you 1,000 acres of forest, Robert \u2014 how are you gonna clear it?"}

And what makes human beings unique is, as far as I can see, they\u2019re the only animal that plays with fire! And from the point we started to play with fire, we started to evolve at a very rapid rate. Genetically, intellectually, sociologically we evolved. And we talk about the fire of truth and the fire of faith. It\u2019s like the keeper of the flame. The keeper of the flame really means something when you have a city, a village, a civilization, a tribe, and you\u2019ve got a fire and it goes out, you might very well die! You don\u2019t want that fire to go out, at all! Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain is a fire! We don\u2019t want it to go out either! We talk about feeding the fire of Bitcoin and we talk about feeding the fire of faith and simply being the keeper of the flame. It was an old idea thousands and thousands of years ago. I suspect it\u2019s the difference between life and death for humanity for a million years! You\u2019ve started the fire\u2014it\u2019s all good! But now once you go back 100,000 years you\u2019d be running around in 42 degree temperature while it\u2019s raining on you! Or what happens when it goes to 20 degrees? If it\u2019s cold and you\u2019re wet and the fire goes out, you\u2019re going to die! It\u2019s not an academic thing \u2014 it\u2019s a serious thing! So human beings harnessed fire and it made all the difference, and then along comes the next set of thoughts. If you can harness fire, maybe you can develop a brain, and maybe you\u2019ll live long enough to use it. The next observation is: you ever wrestle around with a lion or a tiger or a bear? Pick any animal that you wish to kill \u2014 you ever wrestle with a dog that weighs 80 lbs? Not easy! Would you like to fight with one? How do you feel about fighting with ten? How do you feel about trying to run one of these things down? I read about in Runner\u2019s World, runners want to tell you about how humans were always made to run, because ancient mankind chased its prey and it could run 20\u201330 miles a day, and we just run them down until they get tired! Okay well that\u2019s one idea, and maybe we did. But you ever try to catch something that\u2019s running away from you while you\u2019re hungry around dinner time? I don\u2019t really want to run for 20 hours straight until I tire it to death \u2014 I have a better idea, which is hit it with a missle! And by the way I literally mean missles! I mean a primitive sling or an arrow, and I think they found arrowheads that go back 100,000 years! They\u2019re old! Most people think of the slightshot and they think about the kid\u2019s slingshot with the rubber band and the [leg] that kids play with."}

I mean the Balearic Islands like Ibiza they were very famous for slingers. And if you read about them what they\u2019ll say in the ancient texts is, the natives of the Balaeric Islands were raised from age 3. Before they could speak they were raised to operate a sling. The sling is about 6\u20138 feet long, it\u2019s made of animal fiber, and you know, you don\u2019t throw a baseball \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen highlights, right? \u2014 if I increase the lever at the end, if your arm was 12 feet long, you\u2019d generate some serious leverage. A whip action! So those slings give the average person the equivalent of a 10-foot long arm, and they practice with those for years, from age 3! You can imagine after 15 years of practicing, you get pretty good! And they weren\u2019t slinging little light stones or the shit that you pick up on the seashore. They\u2019re actually forming lead bullets! Everybody thinks, Oh yeah! Bullets are from guns! Well they\u2019re not! I mean, people invented bullets thousands of years before guns! Guns were just the latest idea putting bullets together with gunpowder! The lead bullets probably came along 10,000 B.C. And maybe more, maybe 100,000 B.C.! This is a straightforward idea \u2014 if your life depended upon it, you would figure it out. And the figuring out is, you get yourself a very condensed bullet, you put it in the sling. You ever see a good pitcher? A good pitcher can place the ball 90 feet away plus or minus 4 inches? Can a good pitcher hit you in the head if you\u2019re standing at the plate? Now imagine someone that\u2019s pitching a 1\u20131.5 inch lead bullet from 50 yards away that can hit you on the head every time! Because the Romans said they could! So now think about \u2014 and this is how bad it is, right? We\u2019ll talk about this in a bit, but to make the point, these guys could stand 100\u2013200 meters off, and from 200 meters off they could actually hit an animal on the head, or another human being in the head. I mean it didn\u2019t matter if they hit you on the head \u2014 if they hit you on the torso they\u2019re gonna rupture your ribs and you may have organ failure! There\u2019s even stories \u2014 Livy, when he writes about the Second Punic War, he writes about Roman slingers, and they sling so many of these things that they pretty much break all the bones of the Gauls beneath their armor! They\u2019re wearing leather armor \u2014 their ribs are broken. And if they\u2019re not wearing leather armor and they get hit, just like getting hit with a bullet in your helmet it may still give you a concussion. It was never a fair fight! Try taking your 8-foot long spear and having a fair fight with a wolf or a pack of wolves? No. A bear? No. Humanity wouldn\u2019t be here if we hunted or defended ourselves using spears or using \u2014 these close quarter swords and clubs \u2014 they\u2019re all very romantic and they film well in Hollywood movies, in gladatorial combat because you\u2019ve got the two adversaries that are in the same frame, but if you go back a million years, the adversaries were never in the same frame! If you made it this far and you were a human being, you mastered the art of death from above! I mean, killed from a distance and nobody knew that you were there! Not a modern invention. Not only would you stand back 50 meters or 100 meters, you would stand up \u2014 and by the way, you would be up at the top of the hill where you have gravity working for you \u2014 that gives you more range. You would be back. If you were really smart, Robert, if I told you there\u2019s a bunch of whatever creature on the plain and any one of them can eat or trample you, wouldn\u2019t you like to stand up 20 feet on a cliff that they cannot run up? Stand up 20 feet above them, wait for them to come by, blast them either with a sling or use a bow and arrow, and if you miss \u2014 what happens if you miss?"}

If you\u2019re going to dominate, how do you deliver force harder, faster, stronger, smarter? And I could think of a hundred examples in history and they all \u2014 you tend to see those things, so if it\u2019s got the characteristic that it can be made harder, smarter, stronger, faster, there\u2019s something compelling about it! That\u2019s why digital gold is thousands of times better than gold! Because you\u2019ve got all those dimensions to work on! That\u2019s why the natural creature \u2014 gold is a rock, a bear is a bear, a mastodon is a mastodon. They\u2019re not getting harder, faster, stronger, smarter, they\u2019re just doing what they do! Human beings are! But only because of innovation! So missiles are just a tool but they\u2019re illustrative. Fire is an energy network and an energy source! It\u2019s a battery. An energy source and you can deliver it in a certain way. And then that takes us to hydraulics, which is power from water, and water is a network. And we talk about elemental forces: fire and water. Well, you ever look at the ocean, and what the ocean does \u2014 wave action is incredible energy. But another source of energy is buoyancy. You every try to pick up a 2,000 lb weight and carry it on your back, up a hill? Or just across! Put a 2,000 lb weight on a carriage, put it on the back of a donkey, drag it onto skids \u2014 problem, right? And this particular case can\u2019t be solved with fire, we can\u2019t easily burn it! On the other hand, if you needed to move 2,000 lbs you put it on a barge, you put it in the water, and the water pushes back 2,000 lbs, and I can push it with one hand! And the mastery of hydraulics is fascinating! I went to MIT. MIT\u2019s mascot is a beaver! And we have rings that have the beaver on \u2019em, and we talk about, Why have you got a beaver? The answer is, the beaver is nature\u2019s engineer! And the beaver is this near-sighted, short, waddling creature. It shows up, looks around, sees the water flowing. It can just be what, bobcat bait or whatever, their dinner, or it can do something about it! And what the beaver does it just pretty unbelievable! The beaver starts chopping down trees! First the beaver figures out where to chop down the trees, then the beaver chops down the trees, then the beaver turns the tree into a dam, then the beaver channels the river into the dam, creates a pond, floods the pond. It\u2019s like it\u2019s reading the terrain! After it\u2019s got the pond it creates a lodge in the middle of the pond with an entrance underwater, and then it creates its life in that lodge. That pond-water \u2014 water is elemental to life, and that pond creates a vibrant ecosystem and in that ecosystem lots of things grow. And lots of creatures benefit, I mean the ecological diversity improves, and it\u2019s good for all the plant life, the wildlife \u2014 people lament the loss if the beaver screws up forests, and the beaver is just doing its thing and if there\u2019s a storm and the dam gets messed up, the beaver swims out in the middle of the thunderstorm or hurricane or whatever it is and fixes the dam! It\u2019s a very industrious creature! And you just sit back and you\u2019re in awe. You think, Huh? How did a creature figure that out? And then what does that mean to humanity? Of course, it means a lot to humanity! I\u2019ve been all over the world, and I\u2019ve been to the desert, I\u2019ve been to Riyadh, I\u2019ve been to UAE, I\u2019ve been to Singapore, I\u2019ve been to Miami Beach. People think oil is money! They think oil is power! And let me tell you: oil is not really power, it\u2019s not wealth. Water is wealth! Water is the key to life! If I gave you $10 Billion and as much land as you wanted in the desert, you can\u2019t create life! The cost for you to create a pond in the desert, the cost for you to actually create a park with oak trees \u2014 if I gave you $10 Billion and you lived in the desert, Robert, what would you do with the money? What\u2019s the first thing you would do?"}

So what do they do? You buy yourself a jet, you buy yourself a villa in the south of France. You buy yourself a yacht that floats in the Med. And then you figure out how to live your life, because the cost to grow a palm tree in the desert is $20,000 a year! You want 100 palm trees \u2014 it\u2019s $2 Million a year to have 100 palm trees! You want 4 acres of grass in the desert? You have $100 Million a year? For 10 acres of grass? By the way, you still can\u2019t have it! Even if you spent $100 Million a year to put 10 acres of grass in the desert, the sandstorm comes! And it wipes you out! Water is elemental to life. We underestimate how important it is! Until you start paying to create it. Yeah you can stay alive in the desert, but a person making $50,000 a year that lives in a city that has parks and rainfall and a nice temperature lives better than a billionaire in the desert! It\u2019s just that powerful. Now coming back to hydraulics. Hydraulics will generate power, right? I can harness running water running down a hill and create a turbine, then I can create a mill with that \u2014 that\u2019s interesting. Again back to the hunter-gatherer thing. If you dropped me 100,000 years ago and you said, Okay well Mike, use your brain! Go hunt and gather! I\u2019d be like, Screw that! What would I do? I would go find a stream with a little bit of elevation, maybe a mountain stream that had fresh water \u2014 you can drink it. And I\u2019d find a big enough one that had fish in it, and then I would find a point where I could divert the stream to create a pond \u2014 I mean if the beaver can do it, I can probably do it! I would do some digging, I would divert the stream, I would create a lock, and at that point in the year when the salmon or whatever are running I might just flip that lock and I would actually divert the stream into my pond and create myself \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a 100-foot wide pond, maybe it\u2019s a 20-foot wide pond, maybe it\u2019s a 300-foot wide pond. Maybe I would waste a lot of the water \u2014 I don\u2019t care! And I would let 500 of those little fishies get trapped in my pond! I\u2019m not chasing after them with the stick like in Blue Lagoon! There\u2019s no such thing as a fair fight! I\u2019m not fishing with the hook! My idea of fishing is with dynamite! I\u2019m gonna blow up everything in the lagoon, and I\u2019m gonna walk and pick up the fish. But in the absence of dynamite, I\u2019m just gonna divert the water. What\u2019s the flow rate of water? How many fish swim by you? I want them all! Put them in the pond, then what do you think I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna go pull out one a day! And I\u2019m gonna let the other fishies swim around, and if the winter comes and the pond freezes over, that\u2019s okay! I\u2019m gonna chip a little hole in the pond and I\u2019m gonna walk out every day and I\u2019m gonna reach in and grab my fish and I\u2019m gonna eat my fish and I\u2019m not chasing after stuff! When you chase after stuff you twist your ankle and if you break your ankle you\u2019re dying! Right? If you chase after stuff and then a wolf pack catches you from behind, or you piss off an angry mastodon. So hydraulic power, it\u2019s the water, it\u2019s gonna bring you something to drink, it\u2019s gonna bring you something to eat. Maybe if I\u2019m worried about the little creepy crawly creatures or whatever, I\u2019m going to dig a trench around where I live, and they\u2019re gonna have to cross the water to get to me. Maybe I use water \u2014 a moat. If I live on the seashore, I\u2019m gonna find a natural tidal basin. And in that tidal basin, I\u2019m gonna let creatures crawl in! I went to Maine once.

They\u2019ll create a trap, they\u2019ll put some kind of herring or something in the trap that the lobster wants to eat, they\u2019ll drop it, they\u2019ll put 10 of those cages down, and then they wait! Lobsters are lazy, lobsters crawl into the cage, they grab the food, they get stuck in the cage. They pull the trap up, they find a big lobster, they keep that one. They find little lobsters, they throw them back in because they need them to keep growing. They\u2019re creating agriculture to feed the lobster, the lobsters living in happy lobster hotels their entire life \u2014 it\u2019s not so bad, Robert! If I said to you, I\u2019m gonna give you free room and board to age 70 and then I\u2019m gonna eat you! Well, not so compelling! But if I said to you, Robert, I\u2019m gonna give you free room and board until you\u2019re 750 years old, and then your life is gonna end, or, you can make it on your own and you\u2019ll suffer a horrific death being eaten up by a barracuda at age 35, you might think it\u2019s not so bad living in your lobster hotel 10 times longer than you live naturally! It\u2019s not like these lobsters would\u2019ve made it very far! They\u2019re liking it! They\u2019re domesticated lobsters!"}

So what you do, is have the tube be able to hold the integrity. I can\u2019t do it for 1,000 feet, but I can do it for 20 feet. It\u2019s like the way a lock works in a canal, like I\u2019m going into a lock, I close the gate, I flood the lock, it lifts the barge, I open the other lock, and I got out! So imagine a series of locks that I use to actually life 100,000 tons of stone using water! Very interesting! I think that that\u2019s how it was done in my opinion. But water can be used for farming, for fishing, it can be used for security. It can be used for sanitation! In fact, without understanding water and the dynamics of water, there is no cradle of civilization in the Aegean or anywhere! I\u2019ll give you another interesting vignette.

But also unsanitary! I mean, fly-invested typhoid-infested, germ-infested. And when it gets dry and this stuff desiccates and it blows through the air, you\u2019re going to be breathing it, smelling it, it\u2019s just going to be awful! So, you want to drink it and eat it? I mean, this is not just a matter of creature comfort \u2014 you\u2019re gonna die! You can\u2019t actually bring together a bunch of human beings unless you work out the sanitation problem! And it was then and there that it dawned on me very viscerally, there\u2019s a reason why all the streets in Mykonos are so narrow that you can\u2019t get a horse or a cart through them! They\u2019re walking cities! There\u2019s a reason that the equestrian class were the Roman knights. The knights were the equestrian class, and what it meant in Ancient Rome was the top 1%, or the top 0.1%. The nobles of Rome were the equestrian class. What it meant to be rich and powerful was: you had the right to bring a horse into the city. Nobody else could! The problem was not that they couldn\u2019t afford the horses. The problem is if they allowed anybody to bring a horse into the city, it would be so unsanitary as to render the city uninhabitable! So most ancient cities, if you wanted them to work, you would have to have them human-powered, and now you\u2019ve got this dilemma of how do you move goods around? Tell me, how do I move things around cleanly? I need a clean energy source that is not going to foul my sanitary system, that it\u2019s not gonna actually kill me! And of course it\u2019s a boat! What do you want? You want 25 cities with ports on an inland sea with at least a season 6\u20139 months a year where you can cross from one point to another point without being bashed and killed on the rocks. So you need a fairly mild sea, but you have to have water, because if you have the same 25 cities on land and you\u2019re gonna use horse or animal power in order to move goods and services back and forth, it\u2019s just so dirty, so unsanitary, that your civilization\u2019s probably not gonna get off the ground!"}

If you look at all of these empires: the Phoenician empire, the Roman empire, the Venetian empire, the British empire, if you actually tour all the great ports in the Mediterranean \u2014 all the really good ones \u2014 the story goes something like this. Maybe you go to Bonifacio in Corsica. Well in 1,000 A.D. this was the Phoenician port. And then the Greek empire came along and it was an Athenian port, 500 A.D. And then the Carthaginians kicked them out and it was a Carthaginian port. And then the Romans kicked them out and there was a Roman port. And then after the Romans stole them the Venetians took this over it was a Venetian port. And then eventually it became a British port, you know? That\u2019s the story of Malta, that\u2019s the story of Corfu, that\u2019s the story of lots of different ports in the Mediterranean. And the reason why is, if you want to dominate the Mediterranean, you need to have a port within one or two days\u2019 sail that you can hide in whenever the mistrals blow. And if you control that network of ports when the weather goes bad, you go into the port and your ship doesn\u2019t get sunk! And if you don\u2019t and you\u2019re like a week away from a port that\u2019s friendly and the weather gets bad, you get dashed against the rocks and you just die! And that\u2019s the end of it. So these are all nautical networks and they\u2019re all based upon terrain. And the Mediterranean was a good crucible for the beginning of a civilization. And when you put together the incredible power of hydraulic transportation and then you consider the consequences of not having it, you realize: you can\u2019t really develop the economic density. We haven\u2019t touched much on agriculture. We could but the general theme is the same: when I drop you and you find a fruit tree, you\u2019re not gonna go, Oh duh! There\u2019s a fruit tree in this clearing! I\u2019m gonna walk 18 miles to the place where I can find a different fruit bush. And then I\u2019m gonna walk 5 miles back to the place where the fish are! You\u2019re gonna actually pick up a fruit tree and plant like 100 fruit trees next to your fishing pond! You\u2019re not stupid! Like, paleolithic man there\u2019s every reason to believe they were smarter, stronger, and tougher than we were!"}

So I was trying to get a quick overview and feel free to jump in if I\u2019m missing anything, but: it started out with, We can\u2019t handle an animal one-on-one. It\u2019s kind of our wits that make us who we are! Through our wits, we\u2019re able to communicate and coordinate with one another. One thing we didn\u2019t get into is the Yuval Harari Sapiens thesis where he says that, Man came to dominate the world because we can tell and believe stories! Like we\u2019re actually able to abstract and represent reality in symbols, and that\u2019s what gives us the ability to make tools, and so on and so forth. So with those strategies that are often cooperative, we\u2019ve energized them with fire as our base \u2014 I guess we\u2019re harnessing the energy of the world and ancient sunlight through using fire \u2014 and then the other interesting thing about fire is that it actually accelerated our own evolution, right? Our cognitive development was increased because we\u2019re able to liberate more calories from food and whatnot. It also gave us the ability to make harder, stronger, better tools in terms of metalworking. I think that\u2019s a great point too, is that mankind actually changes his own course of evolution through the conscious decisions we make, like the tools we make in turn make us! Which I think is a really interesting point to touch on later as well with money. And then we had missiles, so we could actually take advantage of our visual acuity, which is something unique to people \u2014 and our dexterity \u2014 and actually hunt animals at a distance, and hunt them on a terrain that\u2019s advantageous to us. Then we had to tap into water, because we are water first of all \u2014 humans are 70% water \u2014 we have to consume a lot of water very frequently. I think that\u2019s the quickest way to die! It\u2019s like oxygen first \u2014 we have to have that most frequently \u2014 water second \u2014"}

And I\u2019ve read too that people going without water actually cry tears of blood \u2014 it\u2019s actually one of the symptoms \u2014 it makes your eyes bleed. So not only is water clearly this life-giving substance that we have to have access to fresh water and be able to implement into our agricultural systems and whatnot, but it\u2019s also a tool for overcoming gravity, so we can actually construct larger-scale structures and conduct commerce at scale! So I think that\u2019s a great first principles view on what makes us unique!"}

And we come back to this issue being harder and stronger. We harness that fire and we start to work metals and we move into bronze and we move into iron, and I think the Roman Empire is a great model for the way that human beings interact with technology and the way that they interact with a competitive world and become both antifragile and get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! This same thing was going on in other parts of the world, but I\u2019ll focus upon Romans for a bit! You go read Livy\u2019s History of Rome and he writes about the Roman republic had 700 good years! 700 years before even it went to empire! And we started with this idea of Roman politics. You\u2019ve heard the phrase, Beware the Ides of March, in Julius Caesar, and people think of it as, Oh, well that\u2019s when someone\u2019s gonna kill Caesar, but it\u2019s really referring to the fact that for 700 years, the Romans got together on March 15th and had an election, every year! The Romans were the most organized of all of the civilizations we can find in the ancient world and that\u2019s how they grew to dominate \u2014 they were just organized! One of their forms of organization is \u2014 and this is a thing of beauty \u2014 they\u2019re running a process where every year, Marh 15th they have their election. They appoint two consuls, they appoint all of their officers. The consuls then, they conduct about 2 weeks worth of religious ceremonies. They all worship, they appease the gods, they\u2019re getting psyched up. They\u2019re reminding themselves that they\u2019re unique \u2014 they\u2019re celebrating! Simultaneously they raise an army. They train the army! We go from March 15th all the way through to May 1st \u2014 6 weeks. In those 6 weeks they get organized, celebrate, get excited, wait for a good omen, and they\u2019re really getting ready, and then the campaigning season starts May 1st. Everybody that knows anything about Europe and the Mediterranean knows that the weather gets good on May 1st! The problem before May 1st? It rains, there\u2019s storms, if you set out to sea or you set out across terrain before that time period, if the cold doesn\u2019t get you, the storm\u2019s gonna get you or your ship\u2019s gonna sink or something! Ultimately, in the history of all of these wars, more people die from natural causes than they die from bullets from the enemy! So the number one danger is: nature\u2019s gonna kill you! So they were all basically doing these summer campaigns. So May 1st they started to campaign. That goes through June, July, August, September \u2014 all good months. If they\u2019re still fighting something, maybe around October they wrap it up. They go into winter quarters by November. November, December, January, maybe they\u2019re having November, but certainly December, January, February \u2014 that\u2019s winter! They\u2019re not doing anything because the elements are a much bigger threat than the enemy is! And if you know anything about the Med, you can\u2019t navigate the Med in the winter! Even in the modern day, no one would want to go yachting in the Med in the winter \u2014 it\u2019s just not comfortable, you get storms, weather is very uncertain! So all this time, they\u2019re rest, they\u2019re recuperating, they\u2019re regrouping, they\u2019re politicking\u2014you can imagine! They\u2019re discussing with each other who\u2019s most suited. That guy\u2019s long in the tooth, that guy\u2019s lost his step, this is the up-and-comer \u2014 you support me, I\u2019ll support you. They\u2019re working through that consensus back in Rome, and they\u2019re remembering what it\u2019s like to be a Roman! And then along comes March, and then they decide who\u2019s gonna do what \u2014 you\u2019re gonna be a tribune, you\u2019re gonna be a consul, you\u2019re gonna be a governor \u2014 let\u2019s put in place an administration. And they\u2019re always rotating and they go and they do it again! And if they send off the best and the brightest and the guy takes an arrow in the back, well next year there\u2019s another guy! Scipio Africanus, one of the most famous Roman generals of all time, he rose to power in his early 20s after all of his uncles and his father died in the Second Punic War. His entire family is getting wiped out, but there\u2019s always another Roman! Always another one! From a very early age! And so the political system had a certain elegance to it because it was tied to the calendar \u2014 it was tied to nature! It was a natural cycle, and it took into account the need of human beings to celebrate each others\u2019 successes. I go campaign, I come back, I get a triumph! It took into account their need to have a common faith. The faith is critical! If we\u2019re not all Romans and we don\u2019t all believe the same things, why are we gonna die for each other? Faith mattered! But the weather mattered! And you know, people don\u2019t realize they did it every year on March 15th, because if I told you the weather\u2019s gonna get good on May 1st and you need an army, when would you start? They\u2019re pretty smart \u2014 700 years of it \u2014 that\u2019s the Roman way! And then they also took into account human motivation, which is: everybody\u2019s got an ego. Everybody needs their turn. Nobody can hog all the power, so even if you were the greatest general this year, you\u2019ve gotta give it up to someone else next year! And as long as they kept turning \u2014 and if I\u2019m the second-most powerful family, you\u2019re from the most powerful family, maybe I\u2019ll support you for consul with the understanding that it\u2019s my turn next year! And then maybe my family will fight and die for you! Because we have a chance at glory next year! But at the point where you take over and you tell me, Well you think you\u2019re gonna keep the job for the next 62 years \u2014 at that point, the fabric of the civilization starts to break down, because that equity and that citizenship and that sense that ,We\u2019re protecting the Roman way of life, starts to degrade to, We\u2019re just protecting someone\u2019s dynasty \u2014 screw them!"}

And so I landed on an aircraft carrier and then I got to tour the carrier, and then I got to meet the captain. The average age of the soldiers on the aircraft carrier is 19! Average age!

And so I start talking \u2014 and this is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier! These guys can start a war! It\u2019s like 1/12 of the firepower of the US Navy. It could take down all but like 3 countries in a heartbeat. Maybe you could take down any country in a heartbeat! It\u2019s a pretty important job, Robert, wouldn\u2019t you say?"}

We have to have a constant flow of new talent, new leadership. Someone drops the baton, someone else picks up the baton! That\u2019s what made the Romans great! They suffered no kings among them! You look at the Second Punic War and then maybe it was the Second Macedonian War? Eventually the Romans went to fight against Philip of Macedon. He was a king! And he had an awful son, and his one son got fighting with his other son, and convinced the father to murder the second son, and then the father realized that he\u2019d made a mistake because his first son lied to him! And the father was a nutcase crazy guy, and the son was kind of crazy, and it corrupted the entire society, and the Roman consul was just the most talented general and he knew that \u2014 the way it worked was, his officers were from every other competing family in Rome! If that general was lazy, drunk, cowardly, or stupid, it got reported back by the officer corps to Rome and to the Senate! And so they were slightly gossipy, but the point is, when you know that everybody\u2019s watching you and that you can be replaced and will be replaced next year and your future is uncertain, it brings out a higher degree of professionalism, and that\u2019s the competition in the market!

No apologies about it, from age 3, this is the way it is! And Rome comes first, and everybody else\u2019s interests are subjugated! And when you look at that, they started with that system \u2014 a good system! \u2014 I mean people forget about it! 700 years as a republic! Find me another republic that lasted 700 years [inaudible]. Then you\u2019ve got the Roman army, and that tells a different story. The Roman army takes us back to this issue of, There was never such thing as a fair fight. The Romans weren\u2019t fighting fair! They would\u2019ve laughed at you! The Roman approach to this was to take my illustration of the slinger on the cliff and take it to a whole new level! The Romans manufactured ballistas, catapults, every sword and shield to be the same length, every soldier took the same step the same length, everything was the same! You could be an 8-foot tall goliath, and the Roman 5' 10\" tall normal dude is gonna beat the crap out of you because you\u2019re not gonna get within 12 feet of him because you\u2019re gonna take a spear in the gut from the 12 guys standing to his left and his right as you charge! In all of these time periods, all of these wars, and you read Livy and he describes them very in depth, over and over again: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of battles, and they always consisted of the Romans maneuvered to get the high ground, the Romans maneuvered to get the enemy out on the plain, the Romans unleashed the artillery onto the enemy while they stood and obliterated 10% of them. Then the Romans unleashed some more artillery! There\u2019s one story where the Roman army cornered the Gauls. The Gauls are on a mountaintop, on a hillside, and the Romans are below \u2014 they just surround them, they stop, they start to pummel them, and they rain down hell from above \u2014 bullets, boulders, napalm, and Livy writes, Before a Roman even took a step toward the enemy line, half of the Gauls were dead and 80% of them had been maimed or incapacitated from the bullets. And then the Romans start to move up and do something! It\u2019s like, there\u2019s none of this, Let\u2019s just charge into battle and fight it out with our sword, right? Never happened that way! It was always going to be: find a way to get an advantage. And by the way, the technology is very critical! The Romans had a military industrial complex. There\u2019s a way to do it, you\u2019re gonna do it in a certain way. They had an entire body language, and entire system of how you\u2019re going to act. If you want something which is eye-opening, there\u2019s this story of the Roman navy from the First Punic War. The Carthaginians dominate the Mediterranean, the Romans are a land power. The Romans don\u2019t know anything about naval power \u2014 but it tells you a lot about the Roman psyche and intellect. The Romans are getting beat up by the Carthaginians because the Carthaginians control the ports and they have the fleet. The Romans have no fleet! One day, a storm kicks up, and the storm drives a Carthaginian naval ship into a Roman port \u2014 it\u2019s blown into the port by a bad mistral. The Romans capture it! They take it apart to try to figure out how the Carthaginians make their ships. You can\u2019t make this up! This is the most amazing thing in history! They find out that the Carthaginians make their ships from a kit from reusable standardized parts, and not only are all the parts standardized, the Carthaginians have labeled each part with the instructions with where it fits and the number of the part. The Romans deconstruct the entire thing, steal the entire blueprint. 9 days later they made 150 ships! You think these guys were screwing around? They\u2019re not screwing around! It\u2019s like, everything\u2019s, Oh you know, I\u2019m gonna take my time to figure this stuff out. No! War has a way! War has a way of quickening your activity! Bam! I\u2019m losing? I find a ship, that\u2019s the DNA, that\u2019s the formula of the ship \u2014 150 ships. To make a long story short, the Romans win the First Punic War and they vanquish the Carthaginians and they become the naval power! Of course, it\u2019s not that the Romans invented everything, it\u2019s just that the Romans stole every good idea from every civilization from the Greeks, from the Carthaginians, from the whatever that they crushed! And because they lasted, we\u2019re able to read their histories! It kind of blows your minds that in 500 years \u2014 by the way, you think the Carthaginians invented that? Maybe they stole it from the Phoenicians! 500 B.C., if you want to win wars, you don\u2019t just make ships. And you don\u2019t just train hard. And you don\u2019t just make wagons, right? Roman roads. The Romans had standardized parts, a standardized gauge for a wagon wheel \u2014 every Roman wagon rolling on the road is carving ruts in the road. That gauge has to be standardized, you can\u2019t just make any wagon, you have to make it exactly the same! For all those people that recoil at standardization, well that Roman wagon gauge eventually became the standard width of a railroad track in Europe. And then the standard width of a railroad track everywhere! So if you want to know how wide a Roman chariot was, or a war chariot or any chariot, just go stand on a railroad anywhere on Earth \u2014 the Roman\u2019s gave that to you! And the reason why they did it that way is because, if you build wagons with different gauges, they fall in the rut, they snap the axle, and that\u2019s death! So it\u2019s like, Henry Ford said, You can have it any color as long as it\u2019s black! No! You can\u2019t have it any way you want it! It\u2019s not that every civilization figured this out. It\u2019s just that every civilization which insisted upon doing it a different way with different bells and whistles got crushed to death! There\u2019s an analogy with this in the Bitcoin world too! When you come up with a different feature it\u2019s like, It would just be 10% better, you know, if you made your wagon 10% wider: it would hold 20% more and you would need 10% less and your transaction costs would be less!"}

The fact that a technology already took a certain path, it kind of has an inertia that\u2019s carried the width of the gauge of the wagon wheel to the width of the modern rail! I thought it was interesting too you pointed to the civilizations that won out, the Romans over the Carthaginians, are the ones that studied their history! So they\u2019re actually gleaning insights from civilizations that had come before them, which again hearkens back to that Yuval Harari concept of our ability to abstract our learnings into symbols like language or whatnot, and then pass them from generation to generation such that the most successful strategies take advantage of the collective learnings up until that point! Versus trying to just do something from scratch on your own. Like we all stand on the shoulders of giants, so to speak."}

Well you\u2019ve got a major major advantage! If everybody lays down a railroad track that\u2019s a certain width and you come up with an idea for a car that\u2019s got a different width \u2014 who are you gonna sell it to? People talk about protocols being important, right? Well TCP/IP wasn\u2019t the first protocol! Roman roads probably weren\u2019t the first protocol either, but the point is, protocols matter, and it\u2019s arrogant \u2014 by the way, I\u2019m sure that the Egyptians had protocols to build those pyramids! Standard sizes, widths, weights and measures. Those protocols matter a heck of a lot! And if you don\u2019t have them, it\u2019s impossible for people to cooperate! So we\u2019ve talked about money a lot as being essential for civilization to cooperate and allowing us to specialize, but all these other logistics protocols or military protocols are in their own way equally important! I\u2019ll make one last point on Roman engineering on aqueducts. The Romans understood the importance of hydraulics, and they took it to a new level. They actually created aqueducts that would bring water from up to 70 miles away to a given city. There are a lot of coastal cities on the Med that are uninhabitable \u2014 the natural economic density is really a function of the amount of water per year, so if the amount of water per year is based on rainwater, maybe you can have 500 people live in the city. And if you bring the aqueduct it goes to 5,000 or 50,000. And so the economic density requires the hydraulic flow for sanitation and just to keep everybody alive! So engineering the roads, the aqueducts, it\u2019s the rails upon which the entire Iron Age civilization was built! And Romans \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re engineers! And they elevated engineering, above all! What is engineering? I am an engineer. I think engineering is an incredible honorable, ethical life-affirming profession. The basic credo of the engineer is, I look at nature, and I look at the circumstances that I\u2019m surrounded by, and I use my intellect and every material and technique at hand in order to construct a better world for everyone and everything that I love! That\u2019s the credo! I\u2019m not going to be a victim of circumstance! I\u2019m going to actually change my circumstances with my intellect and that might mean build a bridge. It might mean build an aqueduct, build a road, build a ship \u2014 whatever it is, just like the beaver builds the dam, the engineer builds the world! Look at any city where you take the bridge down, and try to figure out how life changes! And it\u2019s pretty consequential! I\u2019ll leave you one more vignette on Rome and then we\u2019ll move on I think to the Dark Ages. I have a holding company, it\u2019s called Alcantara. And Alcantara is based upon something I saw in Alcantara, Spain. It\u2019s a Roman bridge \u2014 it stood for 2,000 years! And if you go underneath that bridge you\u2019ll find a Roman inscription in Latin, where the Roman Engineer whose name is Julius Locker said, This bridge will stand for all time. They took their engineering seriously!"}

So he knew it was his life and possibly his family\u2019s life on the line, should his architectural abilities be incompetent! Again it\u2019s a protocol! It\u2019s a protocol and an incentive or a disincentive to malperformance for that architect, to take his profession very seriously! Another thing that came to mind, Rome as being incipient too all these civilizational technologies and protocols we use \u2014 what ultimately led to their downfall was their monetary protocol being compromised! It was the debasement of the coin, I think it started with Nero, and eventually led to the forking into the East Roman empire \u2014"}

Taleb I think makes great points in his books about how it\u2019s the death penalty in Babylon if you screwed with weights and measures! Or if you\u2019re a builder and your house collapses, your own family dies. There are definitely skin in the game points, and they just remind you that in a society that respects natural law, nature is not going to pity you and she\u2019s not listening for excuses! I know this is not quite relevant but I can\u2019t help but state it: The richest man in China a year or two years ago was out on summer vacation in the South of France. The guy\u2019s worth $20\u2013$30 Billion. And he decided to take a selfie or get a photo, and he stood up on a rock wall at some ancient ruin in the South of France, and while they were taking the photo, he slipped and fell off the side of the wall and plunged 50 feet to his death! Again, somewhat emblematic of the point \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you have an army of lawyers and $1 Billion of clout \u2014 in that last 2 seconds of his life, he was punished by violating the law of gravity with a death sentence! You know, gravity doesn\u2019t care who you are! Nature doesn\u2019t care! The richest man in China, out of a billion people, and he was sentenced to immediate death \u2014 no appeal, in a split second, for being careless! And when society forms all of these appeals and excuses and they let everybody off the hook, it\u2019s like, Well, if you make a market in accepting excuses and lawsuits, you\u2019re gonna get a lot of lawsuits and a lot of excuses!"}

Michael\u2019s incredible, he\u2019s very deeply knowledgeable about all things: history, tech, energy. I hope you found that conversation as fascinating as I did! And I got a lot of fresh insights talking to Michael, and I love the initial introduction of, There\u2019s never been such thing as a fair fight! So it\u2019s as if everything in nature is always trying to sharpen its strategy to figure out a better, faster, cheaper way of doing things. Namely, getting food, reproducing, things like that. So I thought that was really interesting, and there\u2019s a nice corollary there between ecological strategies an animal might use and a business strategy! It\u2019s the nature of innovation as well. So I came to see evolution and innovation as things that are very closely connected! Evolution being kind of the organic form of innovation, or innovation being the inorganic form of evolution, which I thought was super fascinating! It\u2019s fascinating to me that thinking is what makes us the apex predator! It\u2019s our ability to run these simulations of future action \u2014 we can actually spin up avatars and other elements of the situation and think through them before we actually execute, and we can also communicate about it with one another, so we can out-coordinate other animals, right? So even though we may not have the most vicious physical appendages in the world, it\u2019s our wits that make us men, that allow us to out-compete and be dominate, frankly. The dominant species in the world. On that same vein, another change of my own worldview was how Michael describes that human beings \u2014 as far as he could tell \u2014 are the only animal that play with fire. And by harnessing fire, harnessing energy, we\u2019re actually channeling energy across our intellect \u2014 that\u2019s another way to think about it, is that we create these idea structures in the world, and the visualization I have in my mind is almost like a magnetic field, if you\u2019ve ever seen a diagram of a magnetic field, there are these field lines that emanate out and circle back in the north pole and the south pole. It\u2019s almost as if we could project these intellectual magnetic field lines into the world, and actually channel energy through them to create things and do things! These are the weapons we use, these are the structures we build. Say a boat \u2014 we\u2019ve figured out how to reconstruct the raw materials of nature in accordance with an established intellectual pattern such that that boat now has buoyancy, and we can move ourselves without friction across water! So just a super interesting new way to look at the world! He went into the three primal technologies that helped us build everything around us: fire, missiles, and hydraulics. Fire serves as the prime energy network for humanity. And one thing I\u2019ve long thought about is that it\u2019s common for us to think of energy in different forms. We think of gravitational energy versus kinetic versus heat energy, all of these different forms of energy, but if you really zoom out, I think every bit of energy that we harness on the planet is essentially solar energy, right? So even hydrocarbons, which are very popular today: oil, natural gas \u2014 we\u2019re combusting these hydrocarbons, but what the hydrocarbons actually are is ancient sunlight that\u2019s fallen on the Earth. It fed and formed this biological matter: plants, plants that fed the herbivores, herbivores fed the omnivores and carnivores, and all this energy capture basically dies and decomposes, and that\u2019s what becomes these sedimented layers of hydrocarbons \u2014 of oil and whatnot. So in a way, any form of energy we tap \u2014 even if we think it\u2019s gravitational energy \u2014 I mean I guess the Earth does exert its own gravitational energy to some degree, but a lot of it is coming from its rotation around the sun. So most of the energy, if not all that we harness in the world is actually a form of solar energy! The sun is truly our divine father, if you want to call it that. Our cosmic father. And I guess the one other category would be starlight \u2014 it contributes a small amount of energy into the world. [1:49:45] For all intents and purposes, all energy is solar! And I think that was a really interesting way to look at things. And when we harness fire, we have this force that is a self-generating form of energy. So once we figure out how to spark a fire and control it, we have a form of energy that can expand and produce and generate itself and we use this for a lot of purposes! How he described clearing a forest with fire, I thought that was a super-efficient way to clear a path of predators, of obstacles. Fire is really good at that! Also, it improved visibility for us at night, because night was our worst enemy before fire. When darkness fell, we were essentially neutered. We\u2019re visual creatures \u2014 humans rely on their visual acuity as their primary sense, and under the cover of darkness we\u2019ve lost this primary sense organ! And fire allowed us to re-establish that. We could actually use it to ward off predators, set up camp, it just improved visibility for us in more hours of the day. And it\u2019s a great example too of how our conscious decisions and what we construct and the things we use can actually shape us! We can actually co-evolve with our conscious decisions! An example of this would be \u2014 specific to fire \u2014 is candlelight. Before we could harness fire reliably, we didn\u2019t really have illumination after the sun went down. So candlelight gave us all this new-found time to stay up late, reading, studying, planning \u2014 all these things that help make us more intelligent over time, it created this feedback loop where we discovered fire and all of a sudden fire gave us all this found time or discovered time to continually expand our intellectual horizons even further! Another thing was cooking. Cooking\u2019s so fascinating! Harnessing fire to cook, we\u2019re actually predigesting our food. So we liberated nutrients more easily. We reduced the metabolic load on the body to break down food, and by doing that we freed up resources internally that were reallocated to cognitive development. So by figuring out fire we were able to break down food more easily, predigested, and then we freed up energy to become smarter. To figure out more ways to channel that energy across our intellect. So that was just like mind-blowing! And then finally the fire-based signaling systems he referred to with watchtowers flashing signal fires and whatnot, that\u2019s like the original telecommunication network, where we could project our intellect farther and faster into the world. We further increased that core human capability for collaboration, because now we didn\u2019t need to be within earshot of each other, we could be at long distance! Just to be able to see a signal fire from even miles away, we could communicate certain information, especially when we developed codes like a Morse code we could use by signal fire, allowed us to send information at the speed of light essentially over a relatively long distance! And then the second Stone Age technology that was really impactful were missiles. I thought that this was super-cool because I\u2019d never even thought of missiles on the same level as fire or water, but it\u2019s such a great point because again, back to that original point of there\u2019s never been a fair fight in the universe \u2014 so the way humans can out-compete in nature is by engaging in predetermined unfair fights! We need to engage in conflict that we know we have an asymmetric advantage so we can preserve ourselves and we can obtain the most food energy for the lowest energy expenditure. So like his analogy, Do you want to go wrestle with a lion or a bear, or do you want to hit it with a sling or an arrow from a hundred yards away! There\u2019s much less energy exerted for a much higher outcome of energy consumption in the form of food. And the slings and arrows giving us the power to deliver force faster, harder, and stronger, it\u2019s super interesting stuff! And then giving us the ability to really develop the element of surprise in battle! The advantage to be able to select from where we\u2019re going to just start the engagement \u2014 from high ground, ideally, with the sun at our back, with the wind in our face, downwind \u2014 whatever it may be, it gave human beings the optionality to select when and where they would engage their prey! Back to the whole Sun Tzu thing of terrain being the primary element in any battle. So a bear is probably the most dominant terrestrial creature, whereas in the ocean, say it\u2019s a great white shark or something. The bear is gonna whip the shark on land, and the shark\u2019s gonna destroy the bear in the water, so it\u2019s all about the terrain. The terrain is the first order consideration in any battle. And by using missile technology, it lets the aggressor choose the terrain. The third one, we talked about hydraulics. And I thought a lot about water and how clearly influential and impactful it is on our development. We are water, we\u2019re constituted of 70% water. The old adage 3 minutes without oxygen, 3 days without water, 3 months without food \u2014 you\u2019re dead. So water is very important! But other than boats and buoyancy in general, I hadn\u2019t really thought about the use of hydraulics and channeling gravitational energy, and I thought it was really cool how he brought up the Great Pyramids at least being partially constructed using hydraulics. That they would drill these long tubes or trenches and use the buoyancy of water, its polarity acting as a resistant to gravity and they would use that to overcome gravity and move these giant blocks that they otherwise couldn\u2019t! And that led to the construction of the Great Pyramids and these other monumental constructions that we simply could not have completed using raw human power! We again had to use our intellect and channel energy across it to accomplish greater feats than we could using just our God-given capabilities, our physical capabilities. And I love the analogy, the beaver being nature\u2019s engineer. It\u2019s just so fascinating that like humans do have this ability to channel energy [inaudible] across at the highest order of it \u2014 clearly, but there\u2019s something in nature too where the beaver\u2019s a great example, that he\u2019s actually eating these trees, that\u2019s his food, and also he\u2019s constructing an environment for himself that\u2019s conducive to reproduction. He builds his little fort, blocks the river, creates an entrance under the water, and he has a safe place to mate and raise children. It\u2019s as if nature has this impulse to become smarter. So although there is this big distinction between man and animal, there\u2019s also a continuum. I think of a squirrel that buries nuts for the winter \u2014 he\u2019s kind of engaging in a form of delayed gratification. He\u2019s not necessarily behaving like an economist per se, but he\u2019s a little bit closer than a purely predatory animal that maybe just eats whatever it can! Or a bird that builds a nest \u2014 all these things that nature really is making best use of the gifts that Earth bears. But I think on that continuum, Man is just so far in and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so dominant! I love the example too talking about the moat waters, an effective defensive technology. This points to a lot of history, when America forked off of Great Britain, it was the moat of water \u2014 the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 that made it so difficult for England to continue to project its dominion onto America, and that\u2019s what led to the Revolutionary War, and led to American independence. There\u2019s been a lot of writing! I read a book called The Next 100 Years that made a pretty emphatic case for North America\u2019s geographic situation where we have the Atlantic on one side, Pacific on the other, all of this coastal access makes us a great trading partner with the East and West. It gives us a massive military advantage in that we can deploy military assets into both moats if you will very easily. When he got into the discussion of the Mediterranean a little bit, how it was actually the cities around the Mediterranean because it was the perfect trading ground, a place to move goods and services across water with super low energy. The description of trying to push a block by hand versus putting it on a boat, you can push it with one hand. Once we gained the frictionless or near-frictionlessness of water, the utility of energy becomes super-high. We can accomplish great results with very small effort. So these cities that dotted the inside of the Mediterranean, this created a super energy-efficient network of trade. And that\u2019s what became the cradle of civilization! That\u2019s where civilization first picked up, because there was so much economic density resulted from the low-energy requirements of trade within the Mediterranean! Again back to the terrain being primary to any battle, even if it\u2019s an economic battle, right? Then we got into Romans and how they conquered the Western world, and the insight for me there was that because of the civilizing force of trade and inter-dependency they had, the Romans actually became dominant due to their self-organization. They were the most organized group of humans up to that point in history. And that\u2019s why they became so wealthy, and they became so imperial. They created so much wealth and civilization in and around that cradle that they actually started to expand outwards, and they developed methods of doing this in accordance with the seasons. So they would go out on a military campaign in the Summer and they would come back, have their election processes in the Winter or whatever the timing was, and then they would repeat the whole thing again in the following year. And they also adapted this seasonal ebb and flow into their political structure, so they were giving everyone their chance to make sure that the hierarchy that constituted their civilization was being constantly revivified with the most competent people! So they would shed off this leader and let someone else be elected. And all of that thought and political structure is what underpins Western civilization today! That is the origin of the democratic process as we know it today. So just so fascinating to me how deeply connected we are to history. The other thing that came out to me was it was the ancient Romans that realized the value of establishing a common protocol. Protocol being a means of interaction or a form of interaction or a mode of interaction like a language or a rule set that we both abide by. And when those rules are consensually adopted and firm, it gives us the ability to make a lot of things irrelevant. We can kind of both trust the rule set, trust that we\u2019re gonna play by the rules, then we can just focus on playing the game. Whereas if the rules are messy and we don\u2019t know if this person is gonna follow the rules next year or not, or are the rules gonna change next year or not, we can\u2019t plan, we don\u2019t gain that ability to have a deeper time horizon or a lower time preference, because the rules are mushy! We can\u2019t trust one another as well, so there\u2019s a connection there between the firmness of the rule set, and the development of inter-personal trust, and the proliferation of civilization, which if you think of civilization as essentially being a lower aggregate time preference for the civilization! The lower their time preference becomes, the more civilized they are, and these things find their peak expression in arts and culture and morals \u2014 all of these things! Really interesting to me how all of that just built itself in layers. From the energy efficiency and economic density afforded by the Mediterranean built into this civilization, built into this political structure, built into this military structure, it just really changing the way I saw all of that \u2014 such a history lesson for me! These common protocols\u2014he told this story of the gentleman on the aircraft carrier that the potential for everyone needs their turn, it\u2019s an amazingly potent motivational force for everyone in the civilization! How I relate to that is as a kid there was this notion that anyone could become president in school. And maybe that was just a silly \u2014 it is a silly thing, but maybe just the thought of that as a kid seemed to be motivational! Kids are like, Oh! Yeah I\u2019ll be president one day and so I\u2019ll get good grades, try hard at sports, be good, eat my vegetables, whatever it is! Because there\u2019s this incredibly high aspirational goal, you are incentivized intrinsically \u2014 it\u2019s an extrinsic motivation \u2014 but I think through that you find an intrinsic motivation to be your best and highest and most competent self. I thought it was really interesting that the Romans zeroed in on that so long ago! And then too, he told a story of the Romans discovering the wrecked ship, and then they reverse engineered it, and then a few months later they built a whole fleet of these things. So it goes back to the concept of to never be shameful to emulate. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But in a more pragmatic sense, if there is a solution out there that works better than what you have, you can\u2019t really be afraid to copy it and reproduce it. I mean that\u2019s sort of what the market\u2019s designed to do, right? Which gets into why things like intellectual property are bogus! Because you can\u2019t own an idea necessarily! You can satisfy wants to the highest degree or at the lowest cost and that\u2019s how you\u2019ll be successful in the marketplace, but the idea of owning an idea gets us really on that slippery slope towards totalitarianism where things like numbers can be made illegal, certain words can be owned. It just doesn\u2019t make sense! So I thought it was interesting that the Romans really pressed their military advantage by readily copying ideas from either their enemies or from their forebearers! The other thing there about protocol is he mentioned they laid out these political protocols, but it\u2019s as if by standardizing \u2014 the width of the wheel which has actually been carried over to the width of the track today \u2014 by standardizing these common structural protocols, political protocols, again firm rule sets, they were able to increase their productivity tremendously. Again their productivity and output just exploded, and you can think about this even with home construction. By standardizing the one type of screw or a few types of screws for different purposes, you can produce all of these things at a huge economy of scale. So you can produce these screws at very low cost, which would increase the total output of new homes, the one that you\u2019re constructing with these screws. Versus, if everyone did their own custom screw, nothing would be interchangeable, it would be hard to do anything at scale, it would localize the economy for screws which would drastically restrict productivity. So I love this interesting connection between protocol standardization and economic output and prosperity. And this one really blew me away: the credo of the engineer that Saylor referred to as someone that looks at their surroundings and makes use of their intellect and all of the materials available to them to construct a better world! I mean how beautiful is that? It\u2019s poetic! I think he said at one point, To engineer is divine. It\u2019s so interesting to me that that\u2019s what we are! We are creative creatures by definition! As an example, ask yourself, What is the purpose of your hand? It\u2019s a really hard question to answer, because the hand is by definition multi-purpose! It can do so many different things! It can grip, grab, punch, we can write, type, think, I mean all these different things \u2014 we can signal to one another \u2014 the hand itself, we\u2019re equipped with these ultra multi-purpose tools, and I think in terms of humanity trying to channel energy across the intellect, that the hand is kind of the primary output of that intent, which I thought was really a different way to see things for me! Finally, he got into natural law. Which we could define as the right to liberty, property, and life, So the right to be free, to freely experiment and explore so long as you do not tread on the freedom of others. The right to property, which is \u2014 property is not the asset itself. Property is the relationship between the individual that spends time investing and recreating or making an asset, and that asset. So if I go out and spend my time building a boat, a system with sound property rights would say that I have exclusive rights to that boat. The area that I invested my time and energy \u2014 the thing that I spend my time and energy to create \u2014 I have exclusive rights to that object that I can then trade those rights with other self-sovereign people. And that\u2019s the flywheel of economic activity! So we can each specialize in a craft, but we can reliably go into the market and obtain other things of value \u2014 we can trade our own craft for other things and satisfy all of our wants, but still have a narrow scope of specialization that allows us to become super-adept in that particular area. But that adeptness benefits everyone because we\u2019re trading into the marketplace. So making the point that societies that deeply respect natural law tend to succeed, they tend to out-compete, because they are voluntary games! If we respect natural law, if we respect people\u2019s right to life, to liberty, and to property, then all of a sudden they willingly embrace that society, they\u2019ll work for it, they\u2019ll die for it. The principles that America was founded upon are these principles, essentially! Clearly we\u2019ve drifted a lot since, but that\u2019s at the bedrock of Western civilization! And then at the opposite end of the spectrum \u2014 as I was saying, America is much closer to today \u2014 when you make a market for appeals and excuses, you\u2019re likely to get a lot more of both. As Cicero put it really succinctly, The more laws, the less justice. So I think it\u2019s beautiful how the Romans embraced natural law, implemented it into their society, their culture. I think that became the heritage that\u2019s pouring forth to us! And forming the sediment of Western civilization. And I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us to study this, and see how far we\u2019ve drifted from say when America was founded in 1776 to where we are today. How much the state has actually become antithetical to this entire process. We have this super over-regulated environment, a vast proliferation of complex laws, and a commensurate downfall in justice worldwide! So I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. I thought it was mind-blowing and we\u2019re just getting started, so I\u2019ll see you guys at the next one!"}

And I realized that I knew nothing about economics. I was hearing on the radio people talking about all these different things going on and, despite being a high-performing student in some respects, despite being kind of a smart guy or whatever, I had no clue what they were talking about! And that was quite humbling! So because of that I reached out to some people online to get some information on economics, and I was sent \u2014 thankfully \u2014 basically Rothbard and other ways to the Mises Institute. So I was devouring that all through high school and college, and I think that gave me a very strong if not somewhat heterodox view of money as far as the modern age goes! But that also set me right up for being able to incorporate Bitcoin into my worldview!"}

I mean not everyone takes that information and thinks it\u2019s gonna enhance their life in any way that might impact their actions or their behavior down the road.

That was what it brought me, was the ability to win arguments online. It does also paint a generally coherent view of the world, and having that I think is just generally powerful to have because you\u2019re able to make rational decisions about what to do! It sets the stage so you can apply it to just about any part of your life. So especially with Austrian economics with its specific ways of looking at things like entrepreneurship, it sets you up for thinking about entrepreneurship in a very broad way, encourages entrepreneurship, encourages capital accumulation and all that. With that, whatever it is someone has an interest in beyond just the economics, it can help you in your decision making \u2014 it sets up a good picture of the world to place yourself in."}

It could have been one or the other, but as far as finding that, the very first thing that I read of a sort of Libertarian and economic \u2014 in that realm \u2014 was an essay called I, Pencil by Leonard Read, which is a famous one.

It seems absurd but it\u2019s true because you have to get the wood from somewhere, and that requires all of this specialized knowledge of cutting down the wood, etc., then you have the people who have to go get the graphite, the little metal piece, the eraser, you have the rubber of the eraser \u2014 you have all of these lines of production that go into this single thing! And so there is a factory where probably one guy knows how to take all of those resources and put them together, but that ignores all of the structures of production that lead up to that point! So what that essay taught me \u2014 I mean before I was even done with the essay it just all clicked \u2014 what a market really is, it\u2019s a very expansive set of these structures of production and exchange between different producers and consumers and all of that. Also, because of how complex it is, you probably don\u2019t want to mess with it! So it was very easy with those simple realizations to get sucked into the anarcho-capitalist mindset of Rothbard. From there, I\u2019ve certainly tried to challenge that worldview a lot, but for the most part it\u2019s just been sharpening over time! Adding nuance where needed, but mostly just diving into the implications of this and how we can apply it perhaps to our understanding of the historical events and the world around us."}

I was actually sad that I wasn\u2019t able to get in touch with them while I was still in high school, because it\u2019d be nice to have that camaraderie. They were already like that, so I fit right in! And it was a wonderful group of people and that\u2019s where I met many friends who I know to this day! Yeah the Mises Circle was started later on because when you\u2019re in these groups there is this kind of understandable pattern where you stick with a lot of basics, because you always have new people coming in to check out the group, so you want to keep it accessible to a wide audience. For instance, when the topic of economics comes up, you\u2019ll find that a lot of groups like this, it\u2019s talking about the broken window fallacy over and over and over again. It\u2019s like, That\u2019s a good lesson! It\u2019s great! Every new person needs to learn that lesson! There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s the very first thing in Henry Hazlitt\u2019s Economics in One Lesson. However, as someone who already knows that lesson and has a deeper interest in the economics, there was a desire to be able to dive in deeper with friends. So a few of us just made an additional group that could act as a reading group and dive into whatever was interesting us at the time! There was a gazillion different rabbit holes you can go down within economics!"}

As soon as you get into Bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to stop thinking about it! So in a way it did become the Bitcoin circle! The Nakamoto Institute idea did kind of stem out of that, but basically the Mises Circle was where these ideas were first being developed. We were the ones \u2014 sorry I shouldn\u2019t say the ones, there were other places that were thinking about Austrian economics! \u2014 but it was a place where we were trying to take this thing, Bitcoin, that we had all gotten interested in, and try to apply an Austrian lens to it, to understand it through Austrian analysis! At the time online, there was just not that much to go by to think about Bitcoin from a serious economic perspective. So I was like, Okay, well, we\u2019ll just have to figure this out! The good news is that the Austrians pretty much had money completely figured out! So it was really just about porting over what already existed onto Bitcoin. But that does have its hurdles that I think a lot of people have recognized: that not all Austrians have been able to make those leaps!"}

So in high school you come across Austrian economics, which is not a brand new science. It\u2019s been around since the mid-1800s I believe. But you come across it, you\u2019re not learning about it in school, you dive into it! I don\u2019t know how you come across Bitcoin between 2008\u20132012 but you do, and I see the Nakamoto Institute as a natural extension of the Mises Circle and discussion, but, like you\u2019re touching on, there is that hinge where you\u2019re reframing the conversation, and I find it remarkable that your mind was able to not switch the conversation but switch the framing very quickly upon this new idea! And what I\u2019m impressed by is your ability to digest a new idea to you, and decide what it means to you! So I just think that\u2019s remarkable and I wonder \u2014 for Bitcoiners today a lot of Bitcoiners today they might discover it on Twitter and it still is a very solo experience! And I gotta imagine it\u2019s quite different to be able to have these incubated conversations very early on, and very interesting and very special to maintain these relationships over this long period of time and still be interested in the same thing! Sort of like, I\u2019m amazed when four guys end up in the high school and form Radiohead, and they just happened to meet as children and they\u2019re able to create music together, but also maintain those relationships! Because people change, and your views change, and maybe Bitcoin is this one fundamental thing that doesn\u2019t change. But I find it remarkable! Maybe you could just touch on: Has it been a different ride for you? Having that experience \u2014 you know in college I used to stay up with friends and we used to talk about things all night! Maybe all weekend! And you can get into things in philosophy and metaphysical topics and esoteric things. I have less time with my friends to do that \u2014I\u2019m not saying I have less time now. And then to maintain that dialogue I just think is remarkable!"}

I agree these sustained dialogues, they\u2019re just amazing to have! I think everyone could benefit from being able to find even just one person that they can maintain a dialogue with over the course of years. To this point, people see how Pierre and I are \u2014 we have a podcast together, we did the Nakamoto Institute and all of that, you know?

Now there are actual scammers \u2014 I think everyone would agree, including shitcoiners, that there are many for real actual scammers in this space! But the real thing is just, this article was me trying to take the scarcity of Bitcoin completely seriously! And take these implications to the logical conclusions and think about, Well what is the implication of that in how I should view other people in the space? To me that\u2019s like, If everyone\u2019s a scammer, that doesn\u2019t mean to have a negative view of everyone! But it\u2019s more about being able to cultivate the lowest time preference attitude possible! Because if your default is that everyone is just trying to take your Bitcoins, then it sets a high threshold for what you\u2019re willing to actually give, which means that you are cultivating serious standards for yourself! And all of this is just very important because there are only 21 million Bitcoins and as we\u2019ve seen the price since that article has continued to increase at an exponential rate, and you just have to take that seriously! There\u2019s no going back, and I wish there was going back, because I was a college kid up until around when that article was written! It\u2019s like, I couldn\u2019t even afford Bitcoin when they were super cheap because I was completely broke! So I wish I could go back and be buying $10 Bitcoin! So you have to have that forward-thinking attitude, but not just to tomorrow but deep into the future! So when a person is offering to sell stuff for Bitcoin it\u2019s like, Well what\u2019s in it for you to pay in Bitcoins? Now if there wasn\u2019t a capital gains tax on just any Bitcoin spending, then there could be a reason to want to spend and replace because it\u2019s just like, there are obvious benefits to being able to spend in Bitcoin rather than using a credit card. However as far as pure economics, a lot of people talked about spending Bitcoins as if it\u2019s this sort of great, altruistic thing that grows the network or whatever! No, what grows the network is its scarcity and Number Go Up, not dis-HODLing! And so you\u2019re not really helping, especially if a lot of these merchants are just gonna be turning around and selling the Bitcoin themselves, they\u2019re just suppressing the price \u2014 that\u2019s all you\u2019ve done! Whereas if you HODL it, you\u2019re helping add \u2014 you\u2019re helping the value increase, thus on the very margins you\u2019re benefiting from Bitcoin\u2019s growth!"}

It\u2019s funny you say you\u2019re gonna get people upset \u2014 you\u2019re calling everyone a scammer! So you read that title and I\u2019m like, Alright bro! Let\u2019s go! Like, how am I a scammer? I\u2019m reading through it and I\u2019m thinking, Yes, yes, well he\u2019s gotta call me a scammer somehow, how is he gonna include me? How is he gonna upset me? And then I think the really interesting part is that you did call me a scammer. You said: Hoarders are scammers! They want your Bitcoin! I said, Holy fuckin\u2019 shit! I\u2019m a scammer! He just got me in here! And I\u2019m not mad at him! And I think the reason that \u2014 what clicked for me is that it goes to something that Breedlove just said on my show recently or on Twitter I think, but it was like, Bitcoin kind of unlocks the selfishness to selflessness. So it\u2019s encouraging selfishness to get to a more selfless place for the entire community. But you gotta recognize your self-interest first! That\u2019s what I got through it: I\u2019m a hoarder! I\u2019m a scammer! I want your Bitcoins! I want them for less than you think they\u2019re worth right now!"}

Before the show you were talking about growing up Jewish, I forget what Jewish thinker or whatever but I remember I was hearing something about, You can\u2019t help others if you don\u2019t help yourself, kind of thing. So that\u2019s a bit of wisdom that people walk around with and can often forget about it when they demand that other people just be altruistic for no other reason than someone wants some free stuff. But yeah that\u2019s a common viewpoint of how free market capitalism, not corporatist capitalism or whatever the heck you would even want to call this hellhole that we have. Because Mises writes about the sovereign consumer. Where ultimately a producer on the free market \u2014 he has to be selling to someone, and the person buying things is the person who gets to decide what makes or breaks that producer! They are the real sovereign! You can put a product out on the market, but that doesn\u2019t mean that anyone is going to buy it! So if you cannot create something that people are willing to buy, then you\u2019re shit out of luck! So in a free market capitalist system, you have to think about other people\u2019s wants and needs in order to even satisfy your greediness! Which I think is a very good thing for a society, because you do have to basically be empathetic of others and think about others\u2019 needs! And then if you do well at satisfying those peoples\u2019 needs, you get handsomely rewarded, so in a sense what Breedlove was saying, that sort of selflessness is kind of rewarded. So the only way to be very successfully selfish is to be selfless in one sense of the term."}

And I\u2019m reading this article probably in 2019, maybe 2018? And so now there\u2019s five years where I can look at data points, and see how right you are in the article! And then you bring up under the topic of Investments are scams \u2014 and this blew me away when I was revisiting this the other day \u2014 you talk about, Investments are scams because they\u2019ll lead you to believe that you can get a higher return than holding the Bitcoin itself! Despite the economics of Bitcoin naturally making this an absurd claim in the medium-run, in a post-fiat world there\u2019ll be plenty of investments that have a greater return and risk than holding Bitcoin, but they\u2019ll be assets that generate Bitcoin cash flows. I think that\u2019s astounding, talking about Bitcoin cash flows in 2014! You know, we look at this in 2021, and the writing\u2019s on the wall: you can look at something like MicroStrategy and what they\u2019ve done with their treasury, and you could just look at the data points of the price of Bitcoin compared to anything else in the market! And that\u2019s what gave me\u2014when I\u2019m revisiting your work and I\u2019m enjoying the humor and the wit and the cleverness, is also the truth in it! The facts and the data points."}

She moved to Hollywood when she was young, wanted to get into the movies, never got into the movies, and held that sign for decades. And it was sort of like a running joke in town! And she ends up in the movie holding the sign, and the reference to it is making fun of her for holding that sign! And yet that\u2019s her dream! Her dream is to be in the movie, and she got in the movie, and I\u2019m imagining in my mind that she doesn\u2019t even care that they\u2019re making fun of her in the movie! It\u2019s a fait accompli. But to me it\u2019s the saddest thing in the whole world. That\u2019s what I got across from your conversation with Peter. So what does it mean to reject activism?

There are a lot of things that I think everyone wants to change in the world. There\u2019s certainly things I want to change in the world, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been interested in Bitcoin and other related topics! But a lot of people have been trained to think that, for instance, going to the voting booth every four years or whatever is the highest calling as far as actually doing something to change the world. Now, do some elections matter? Probably, there\u2019s probably like different local elections that people could get involved in, where they can actually have a real impact. I wouldn\u2019t discount that! But as far as like, voting for a president, for one, I still don\u2019t even know if the president is actually even a powerful entity or if it\u2019s just an entertainment show in front of other power structures!"}

So there\u2019s that but it\u2019s also the sheer number of people in your voting blocs, you just don\u2019t have an appreciable statistical effect! So if that\u2019s the case, then why expend so much energy on that one act, as opposed to other things that you can do in your life? People look towards that activity as a way to address a lot of big problems in life, so like, You name the area of their life and someone will tell you how voting for the right person is going to fix everything, or get us put on the right track! Meanwhile, I think there\u2019s just laziness in, at the very least, assuming that elections are the be all, end all. So externalize all of that responsibility onto just some ballot thing you throw out. Because I think about the world around us: there\u2019s a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities, there\u2019s a lot of places that you as an individual can make actual impacts in your community, in your family, and none of that involves having to go convince a bunch of people to fill in a bubble the same way you do! But, it does involve having to do actual hard work, and I think that\u2019s perhaps something that people are not interested in doing, and certainly it is hard work! But in order to get anything done in this world, you do have to put in the work! So I find it unfortunate that people hinge so much of their life on politics, without thinking about these other opportunities they can take to improve their station in life, especially when those other opportunities not only will have an effect, but probably could have an even bigger effect than those elections themselves! So I think Bitcoin is just the best example of this, because the Federal Reserve has been a problem since the day it began. It was created because banks wanted to control the money supply further so that they could manage our lives more than they could manage it prior to the Federal Reserve. And it\u2019s devalued our money since then in a dramatic way, it\u2019s had all of the effects on the economy that we could have whole podcasts on. So it hasn\u2019t been fixed, it was never fixed \u2014 for the most part people weren\u2019t even talking about it! It wasn\u2019t even that much of a topic at all until Ron Paul and especially in his presidential runs, where he opened people\u2019s eyes to this! But even then Ron Paul was merely educating \u2014 now, I say merely and yet, I think most of the people who hate the Fed, that kind of stems from Ron Paul \u2014 so, many thanks to the good doctor for spreading the word and getting us to believe that. Even so, as far as political action \u2014 to actually do something about it \u2014 that\u2019s been at a complete standstill and obviously we\u2019ve sort of regressed in the sense that the monetary supply continues to increase, there are no checks on the system, we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening this week with Gamestop and it\u2019s revealing a lot of absolutely insane inequalities in the way the monetary and financial system is set up and effectively rigged. So it just doesn\u2019t go anywhere! We make no progress no matter how much we might stamp our feet with regards to the fact that the Fed exists and hasn\u2019t been audited. But Bitcoin comes along and it comes at it in a completely orthogonal way that\u2019s also completely productive, it\u2019s just like, Okay! We\u2019ll just make our own! And we just do that! I don\u2019t even have to consider the idea of calling a Congressman to say, Hey! Can you uh, think about ending the Fed? I don\u2019t have to do that at all! I can just go stack sats! And every sat you stack is at the margins pushing us towards hyperbitcoinization! Now, maybe not to a large extent, but they all add up! Every sat that\u2019s going into deep cold storage is pushing us closer to a fully Bitcoinized economy. So because of that, the actual expenditure of energy is going towards a much more fulfilling place. We\u2019re actually getting something for the effort that we put in now! So before, I was a Libertarian pre-Bitcoin, I\u2019d stamp my feet, I was like, Oh! How bad is it that we live in this world that has the Fed! I don\u2019t have that negativity anymore! I don\u2019t care! In fact I feel bad for all of the Americans who are harmed by it, but I actually kind of relish the Federal Reserve taking absurd action, because it\u2019s like, You\u2019re just digging your own grave! So we can actually be somewhat accelerationist on that now! It\u2019s like, Yeah! That\u2019s fine! We have our own thing now!"}

Not his presidential bid, but my question is: I\u2019m not very familiar with Ron Paul. And when Ron Paul ran for president, I saw it in the same way \u2014 I was in New York, I wasn\u2019t familiar with this senator, and I wasn\u2019t listening or hearing the arguments per se, so I just knew that there was a flank senator running from one of the lower states of the union. And it wasn\u2019t anything more to me than a flank \u2014 an Andrew Yang running, or anybody else, right? And I think Andrew Yang\u2019s a bad example here, I\u2019m not discussing him here either, but I think he\u2019s been more well received than Ron Paul was by the greater masses! I\u2019m not saying I receive him well or not, I think more people received Andrew Yang better. And what I\u2019m getting at is, Ron Paul was not received well in the north, or in New York, or in my circles. And that precluded me from doing my own research. So I\u2019m curious \u2014 and I\u2019ve heard you speak very highly of Ron Paul \u2014 so my question is, Where did he come from, and what did he mean to you \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about presidential run \u2014 I\u2019m talking about him [rising] up and speaking to the Fed?"}

People should actually go back and read some of his statements in Congress. He has amazing stuff! I think relevant to Bitcoiners, for instance \u2014 they would probably love reading what he had to say about KYC regulations and stuff like that! When that was going on I was not that familiar with him. I knew one or two people that were into him, but there was in particular a moment in one of the debates \u2014 I don\u2019t think I was even watching the debate live but I think I saw a clip later on \u2014 one that I think had a big effect on many people, which was him standing up to Rudy Giuliani with regards to Osama bin Laden and the War on Terror, and Ron Paul pointing out that, You know, they attacked us for a reason, and they stated that reason! Now that doesn\u2019t mean that that was a good reason, but we can go and see what was the grievance that they felt that caused this to happen in the first place, and in what ways can that cause a need for self-reflection? And in this case it\u2019s like, Well we\u2019ve been meddling around in the Middle-East for so long, it has created a lot of aggression towards the American foreign policy machine and the war machine that has been basically oppressing those people! And of course they\u2019re gonna be mad about that! So it was a great moment \u2014 people should go watch that! In hindsight really what that did \u2014 that didn\u2019t make me a Ron Paul fanboy, it just made me [think], Oh! He\u2019s like a cool Republican!

And his time in politics was also like a means to be able to educate people about these topics that you don\u2019t hear about! No one talks about the Fed! Going forward though I was all on Mises.org and reading all about Austrian economics, and I kept seeing the name Ron Paul! Which was very surprising, because he was just like that random old guy that was pretty cool in the election! And I soon found out that all of this Austrian economics stuff I was getting into, he was all into that! That was the whole basis of his entire political platform! In hindsight it was like, Oh! That\u2019s why he was so cool! Because he was spouting this stuff that I\u2019m learning right now! And so I came to respect him because I found out he had been a major proponent of the ideas that I was very much getting into. And by the time the 2012 election was happening, if he had become president, how cool would that have been?

And when I get in on the conversation it turns out that, well, everyone is completely wrong about how all of this stuff works at all! The point is is that the event itself was not impactful on me, but the fallout of it, spurring an interest in economics, was extremely impactful on me. So I would say that 9/11 and COVID and stuff were much bigger events as far as an actual appreciable effect on me, because 9/11 I was quite young, but I certainly remember the effect that it had on the community around me. And COVID had obviously we were all stuck in our homes and stuff like that. I never had to wait in line to go to the grocery store and I know that\u2019s very minimal compared to the hardship that a lot of people have but I bring that example up because that was the first thing [where it] became apparent that something it for real different here! It\u2019s not like COVID was the first time there had been a scare about some kind of viral epidemic. In my childhood I remember there was monkey pox, SARS, a brief time in 2014 that people thought Ebola was gonna find its way over, so it was not the first time that there had been a scare of a viral epidemic, but it was the first time that it had been a viral epidemic that actually had an effect.

What\u2019s weird is that I don\u2019t actually feel that weird anymore! For a long time I was kind of the weird one because, Hey! I think that it would be better to homeschool kids than to send them to public school! I think that perhaps it\u2019s actually better to live away from a city! Instead of being in the middle of the city. Or I think people should probably have semi-automatic rifles at home for self-defense! I think people should have magic Internet money that they hold for the future! And all these things were a little crazier to say in 2019 than they were by the end of 2020. Now it\u2019s almost like, Yeah! Who doesn\u2019t want to go move out into the country! I mean everyone has had to homeschool to some extent and I\u2019m sure many people have kind of seen some of the benefits! So it has accelerated and I think it\u2019s great! You know I think it\u2019s terrible circumstances, but I do hope that in the fallout from that, people got shaken out of their norm in a way that can reorient them towards a more positive way of living life! So I\u2019m hoping that we can come out of all of these negative events with a better way of living. That\u2019s a little bit of optimism I have.

Do you think that sovereignty is achievable at some individual level \u2014 you\u2019ve talked a little bit about this where we\u2019re a ways away from an individual being able to accumulate enough capital to take on the state and be sovereign. But in terms of, you can stack sats! You can be 100% Bitcoin! But, you\u2019re gonna get taxed if you spend and replace, most of society is still operating on fiat and central banking usury, and now the government I feel is \u2014 and whether it\u2019s on its last legs or not as Alex Svetski believes \u2014 it\u2019s sort of rearing its ugly head and involving itself more in our lives. And I feel more restrictions and more externalities than ever since I\u2019ve been involved with Bitcoin. Bitcoin gave me a lot of that freedom in my mind and a way to put myself out of circumstances I didn\u2019t want to deal with! Kind of like what you were talking about \u2014 why fix this field? If this field is horrible, let\u2019s go find another field and farm that land! I don\u2019t have to spend my life making this field better!

Like there\u2019s just a rat race! I look around and there\u2019s a lot of people that are in a rat race that I\u2019m not quite as concerned about! For instance like having to be able to save money and then go an invest it or whatever. I feel like having Bitcoin in a portfolio helps slow that down. It\u2019s like, Well! You have your Bitcoin! You have this thing for the future! You don\u2019t have to be constantly looking for get rich quick schemes, which a lot of millennials seem to do! Which is I think what drives a lot of this Gamestop behavior! Some of the other forms of that \u2014 people just want to find the quick way out because it\u2019s the only way out! So Bitcoin kind of fixes that rat race a bit because even if you just have a normal wage job if you can just put a little bit away each paycheck, you\u2019re going to be making a lot of progress, especially as time goes on! We see what happens in four-year cycles! So I think that\u2019s going to have an even bigger effect on someone of lesser means! And so in a way that\u2019s sort of more sovereignty because it\u2019s like feeling less constrained by the universe! You don\u2019t have to worry as much about where food is gonna come from next week, and you can think more about a long term vision of stuff. And when you have that long term vision and the actual idea of what capital you\u2019ll have available to achieve that, when stuff like a tax or something comes up \u2014 Yeah we can all go on about how taxation is theft \u2014 but you\u2019ll also be able to take that reality into consideration much more easily! It\u2019s like, Okay! Yes! Add that cost of doing business, but that won\u2019t get in the way of my bigger vision! Yeah I don\u2019t know that anyone gets to true sovereignty, but you can always be accumulating that capital to be able to address and build towards those long term visions, even with certain constraints popping up!"}

Just on that topic, I think what people do need to realize is like, In order to do anything, you need to be able to do something! You can\u2019t eat unless you\u2019ve produced the food! So capital is a necessity, it\u2019s not \u2014 but I think when that word comes up it\u2019s often in a Marxian view where capital is seen as this being of its own that\u2019s above us or whatever. I view it as just tools. Capital is just tools. If you want things, you need capital! You need the tools in order to produce it, you need to accumulate capital so that you can address human wants beyond just what\u2019s in front of your face! You don\u2019t want to be the person who\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck which is what you\u2019re doing in the state of nature. Austrians like to talk about Robinson Crusoe economics, meaning the person who\u2019s stuck on an island! So you get thrown on a deserted island \u2014 when you start out, all you have is whatever berries and fish you can gather day after day. And it\u2019s not until you start finding a way to catch more than you actually consume that you can start to think beyond, What am I going to eat today? And once you can solve that problem, you can begin to solve a bigger problem. And it\u2019s only through that process of accumulating those tools \u2014 whether it\u2019s in the form of knowledge, physical productive factories or whatever, but you need that in order to actually, for real, solve the the problem, so you can get to bigger problems!"}

Maybe with an influx of people or something like that? And it seems like you\u2019re outside of town. I\u2019ll loop that in with a little bit of, What is your take on the word citadel, and are you in a citadel situation where your neighbors don\u2019t matter? Do you have a citadel in your mind, and your neighbors don\u2019t matter? Or are your neighbors getting better or worse? How are things going in the neighborhood?"}

As far as citadels, the original Reddit post that citadels came from was this super-dystopian vision of the world where basically we lived in this Brazilified world where you have slums everywhere and then pockets of very wealthy people and they have these fortified areas to keep out the riff-raff. Like the movie Elysium or whatever \u2014 that\u2019s how this envisioned it, and if you don\u2019t get your Bitcoins then you\u2019re stuck outside of it! I don\u2019t really think about it like that! I actually think that a sound money economy will be good for everyone, rich and poor! And it will increase the quality of life for everyone who\u2019s able to denominate their economic life in Bitcoin rather than a fiat currency. Certainly there\u2019s going to be people who were able to buy thousands of Bitcoins and they\u2019re going to be uber-wealthy and I hope they enjoy their many yachts! Although more boats means more potential for boating accidents so I hope they stay safe out there! My vision for the so-called citadel has more to do with what Hoppe describes with city-states, and just having more localized governance! So that instead of being ruled over by a highly central organization that manages millions upon millions if not billions of people, you have localized governance systems that are more in control of their own private lives without the input of those groups. And with that, you then have more of those groups who are having to peacefully interact with one another because they rely on one another for trade of resources. And I think that just turns back the clock a little bit in some ways but also turns it forwards with the technological capabilities. Back to a time \u2014 massive centralization of state apparatuses is a new thing. Before the mid-1800s, Germany was hundreds of little nations! And same with Italy, and same with all of these places \u2014 a gazillion little micro-nations! And these places will tend to be generally more peaceful because they rely on one another, for one, and they\u2019re also inwardly focused on some things. I would recommend that people go \u2014 there\u2019s a Hoppe talk, The Advantages of Small States or something like that. He\u2019s gonna do a better job than me at explaining that! But that\u2019s more of what I think of with the citadel is more about localized governance so that people can find communities that best serve their individual needs as opposed to what a faceless bureaucracy thinks your life should be managed as."}

For me that goes back to Shawshank Redemption where Tim Robbins can find freedom in prison because this man is free wherever he goes, whereas Red was institutionalized and the moment he gets out of prison he wants to go back to prison and go back to the rules, and he doesn\u2019t want to be free because he\u2019s been institutionalized. So that\u2019s kind of my citadel, it\u2019s just always be as free as I could be in my mind, and find the tools in the real world that will expand my physical freedoms.

It was really hard to convince my kids and my wife that I need to go to Texas to listen to these guys talk about this money that keeps going down in value in terms of US dollars! And in my mind I wasn\u2019t really worried about the USD denomination because I understood what I was getting into at that point, but it was hard to convince other people! It\u2019s like I\u2019m telling them, I want to go vote. And they\u2019re like, Yeah. Okay, cool! But maybe this is not the year. And I didn\u2019t get to go. And another reason there is it generally takes place on my birthday! Again \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna be here for my birthday, which is generally when we throw the biggest family party of the year because my daughter was born right after me, so it\u2019s not even my birthday party and I don\u2019t even tell people it\u2019s my birthday! So I didn\u2019t get to go, but I\u2019m sitting at home, and, Yo, that shit came across Twitter, and it lit a fire! That was the first time that Bitcoin entered the physical realm for me! Where I felt the vibrations! It felt like the mind hive \u2014 the human global consciousness. Bitcoin reverberated with me as an individual before that \u2014 I had sort of enlightening moments with Bitcoin, but this was where I was like, Holy fuckin\u2019 shit!

It is using different persuasion tactics to try to win someone over on an idea, or make someone feel a particular way. Whereas, dialectic is very much like dry debate! It\u2019s like, let\u2019s look at the facts, let\u2019s argue through the logic. Think of an Oxford-style debate! That would be a dialectic! A rhetoric is more like a United States presidential debate where you just get on stage and no one\u2019s trying to make a clear argument about like the system of government and, Here\u2019s why this not a good way to do things. I propose that we do this because XYZ \u2014 it\u2019s all a bunch of \u2014 it\u2019s a show! And the problem is a lot of people want to engage in dialectic because it\u2019s how you learn, you have to sit down and really think through things. But not everyone is having a good faith discussion! When you\u2019re on the Internet, there\u2019s millions, there\u2019s billions of people on there! So each one of those people is going to have a different interpretation of everything that\u2019s flying through the screen\u2014another problem with that is it\u2019s a very hostile environment! A lot of people I think they\u2019ve finally come to realize this: the Internet for a while had a hippy feel-good feeling to it, where it\u2019s like fun good times, people are nice, everyone\u2019s having fun!"}

There\u2019s also plenty of good uses too! But he is explicit about, This is not about being right and truthful, this is about winning the argument. And so he has all of these different tactics like, Oh! Your opponent says this? All you have to do is turn it around with this jab and you\u2019ve totally destroyed him! So it\u2019s like the art of the troll from the 1800s! You know, these ideas, they have been around for a long time\u2014on the Internet, because there\u2019s such a high volume of information, we get to see more of these little argumentative simulations happen in real-time, and so we almost get a sharper sense of them. That\u2019s not to say \u2014 I don\u2019t want to suggest that we\u2019re better than Schopenhauer or something, we\u2019re better than Aristotle \u2014 Aristotle\u2019s gonna be better at dialectic than I am, and Schopenhauer\u2019s gonna be better at rhetoric than I am, and probably dialectic than me. And Aristotle also wrote on rhetoric \u2014 both of these guys are gonna be better at both than me! But, I\u2019ve probably seen more argumentation than they have, and so there\u2019s been more iterations. So in a way, I would guess that a lot of people today have sort of strengthened those muscles in ways that they couldn\u2019t have imagined! And the landscape is I\u2019m gonna guess much more chaotic than it had been, and it\u2019s engaging in much different media, so we also have to deal with like imagery! How does an image come across! Neil Postman in the 80s spoke in Amusing Ourselves to Death, where he was basically saying that television, the medium, totally changes our interaction with intellectual concepts because it sort of turns everything into cheap entertainment! Because everything now is based on these visual things rather than \u2014 he describes how normal Americans were going to the Lincoln-Douglass debates, which meant that normal Americans were sitting down and listening to Lincoln and Douglass engage in dialectic for like six hours straight! And they were able to take in all of those ideas! We don\u2019t have that landscape anymore! We have like, Here\u2019s a funny picture! And you could generate those extremely fast. We get on Twitter and we just have a constant stream of Tweets. It\u2019s a very heated battlefield! And yeah, I think if you don\u2019t have this attitude ready to understand that people are going to engage in rhetoric, troll one another, be hostile to one another, purposefully misinterpret one another \u2014 if you don\u2019t have that attitude, you\u2019re probably going to have a bad time!"}

I\u2019m gonna just read off a little bit of this: Definitely know when to argue, when to troll. It\u2019s important to have echo chambers \u2014 it let\u2019s you cultivate a group of people who share these ideas. That\u2019s something that I kind of struggled with. I sometimes feel that we\u2019re in a Bitcoin echo chamber. I was definitely someone who was outside the echo chamber, and the Bitcoin echo chamber drew me in! I saw the Tweets, I don\u2019t know how they kept coming across my feed, but I couldn\u2019t argue with them, I couldn\u2019t refute them! So I do think it feeds out, but it is also about growing the group and giving an opportunity to get good feedback and information from the group. You\u2019re not really talking to the people who you are replying to on Twitter \u2014 it\u2019s for the other people! And it\u2019s really key to understand that! And you must understand who your actual audience is! I love this: relentless propaganda every single day! Just do it! Pump it out! This is good for Bitcoin, there is no bad news for Bitcoin! We must always anchor on the most bullish position! You should never be afraid to take the possibilities to their logical extreme, and from there work reality into your model with nuance as necessary, as needed, and as deserved. A no-coiner doesn\u2019t necessarily need to understand that, Oh we might be going to $99 million instead of $100 million \u2014 always give them the most bullish! Their opinion isn\u2019t merely wrong it\u2019s completely wrong \u2014 always be bullish! And one of your final \u2014 and this really struck with me \u2014 trigram memes are good! Think about three-word memes! That\u2019s what resonates right now!"}

That\u2019s just a pattern that has emerged. So that\u2019s me making an observation, not so much a dictum! Because if you took it as a dictum, then Have Fun Staying Poor would never have emerged!

So like, you can read someone or play for someone the audiobook of The Bitcoin Standard \u2014 you can also just say: Number Go Up! It\u2019s both effectively the same thing! But you need that idea to be able to fill in for every type of discussion. So if it\u2019s a very long \u2014 you have time to read a book \u2014 discussion, you can read the book.

That\u2019s not what I\u2019m personally interested in. There can be a certain entertainment value of that, but the reason I talk about Bitcoin at all is not because I just want to troll people! It\u2019s because I actually believe in Bitcoin and I want more people to become Bitcoiners so that they can also share in the wonderful gifts that Bitcoin has to offer! So with that, yeah! We need to actually understand how Bitcoin operates if we want to be able to communicate that, no matter in what form we end up communicating that best. So it could be best that you\u2019re talking in a very trollish tone sometimes. It could be better for other people to be doing academic research or whatever. But the point is either way, in order to be able to craft the best message whatever that best message might actually be, you\u2019re gonna have to actually understand how does this thing function.

I don\u2019t just want to be believing things just for the heck of it! I also hope that the people who do get brought in\u2014and I think they do!\u2014there tends to be this great culture in Bitcoin where once people are brought in, they\u2019re lured in because it is so strange and interesting, and then they themselves find themselves going down that rabbit hole of learning more! Which has some funny consequences because you get situations where you have tons of people swarming someone on Twitter for saying something stupid about Bitcoin, and that person might actually think, Oh! Are these bots? Is this coordinated? What is going on here? It\u2019s not coordinated! I mean maybe there\u2019s a case somewhere, but by and large it\u2019s not a coordinated effort!

And the rejuvenation via animal life or carnivory? What does that mean to you? And I\u2019m wondering when are you moving to Colorado?

I mean look, I\u2019m a Texan and so I think I\u2019ve always had sort of a \u2014 always in that background was a romantic view of the West and frontier culture is very much present in Texan culture! As far as that, I think the whole meat thing is a rabbit hole unto itself, but I think our society is not well aligned with the environment, and I don\u2019t say that because I want to take us back to a pre-Industrial society or something like that! I actually think that a free market would be more conducive to ecological sustainability. But part of that is we just see a lot of ecosystems being destroyed and I want to see that reversed! And a less popular opinion \u2014 although it\u2019s gaining in popularity \u2014 is that large ruminants are good for an ecosystem, rather than harmful! So the common belief is that cow farts are going to destroy the climate. And so you need to stop eatin meat, we need to end factory farming \u2014 all of this stuff. Basically end meat production more generally speaking because it is destroying the environment! But I have the opinion \u2014 and people can look into this by studying Allan Savory and others \u2014 there\u2019s a book that recently came out called Sacred Cow that brings up more of the environmental issues. But basically large ruminants are a vital part of the ecosystem! Because they break down the soil, aerate, which allows the soil to capture more nutrients, they shit, which also brings nutrients back to the ground. They\u2019re very much part of the actual lifecycle! The animals were there! We followed the animals into America! Not we specifically in terms of my ancestors, but humans as a species followed large ruminants across the Bering Strait and down into the Americas. These animals have always been a part of the ecosystem, and it\u2019s absurd that they\u2019re suddenly causing a problem, when in fact we can see when you introduce more of these animals and manage the herds well, they revitalize these ecosystems and they can bring back grasslands to places that have completely lost their grasses. You have a desertification of some landscapes, but once you have those animals stomping around and shitting and all of that, you get the grass back, and then it\u2019s full of life again! So I want to see more regenerative agriculture! I\u2019m obviously a big meat-eater and I care more about the ruminants, but also other styles of agriculture for other products can also be brought into a more regenerative production cycle, and I think that\u2019s better for humans as well. I think it probably increases the quality. It certainly increases the quality of the environment that we get to enjoy! I\u2019d like going out into nature and seeing nature so it\u2019d be kind of sad if all that lost its life because we\u2019ve failed to maintain it through these practices. Anyway, I think people, as far as the buffalo in the American west, I think people greatly underestimate just how many bison there were running around the American Plains! They had herds that were miles wide that would take people days to cross, to get from one side of the herd to the other! These things were just absolutely massive, and they were all part of a thriving ecosystem and I think we can bring that back!"}

When I went to prep for the show I started from the beginning, and I\u2019d almost forgotten how much I had digested of your work, how important it was to me! And I say that sensitively in the terms of like, when I was reading your work in 2019 I wasn\u2019t podcasting, I was just consuming writing about Bitcoin, it wasn\u2019t important to me necessarily who wrote it or the consistency of the voice from piece to piece. So if I had visited you in March of 2019 and came back in December of 2019, I was linking some of it but I had read a tremendous amount of stuff in between, maybe I had caught you in a podcast or two \u2014 or ten \u2014 in between. But I was just digesting for the sake of taking it in! And the pieces I do want to focus on which are Money, Bitcoin, and Time, the Tyranny of Time Scarcity, and Masters and Slaves of Money, those pieces are really important to me because Money, Bitcoin, and Time is a piece that stands with I think The Bitcoin Standard and Vijay\u2019s The Bullish Case For Bitcoin. It takes a lot of those same principles and distills them, and I think in a very complex yet simple to digest way! And when I revisited your work though, I really started to get bigger themes than I had picked up the first time. [02:57] Not only was I like, You\u2019ve got a mountain of work! I have it all here all printed out! And I\u2019m going through it and I\u2019m like, Wow this is a mountain of work! And I still had to read it again maybe two more times, but I\u2019m like, I remember this! This is all coming back to me! These are the stories I tell when I try to explain Bitcoin! I just didn\u2019t necessarily remember the author per se! So they\u2019re very important pieces to me. So just thinking about Bitcoin and time and money: how is money a story told by humans?"}

It was actually the first thing that I wrote about Bitcoin, and similar to you I was just digesting for a number of years \u2014 about two years before I wrote that piece. I guess I published that at the end of 2018? January 2019. So I had been going down the rabbit hole since the end of 2016, so a little over two years of studying nonstop like you had just described. And that was pretty much a synthesis of everything I had learned up until that point. So actually it drew heavily from The Bitcoin Standard, it drew heavily from Vijay\u2019s work, and the work of many others. And I tried to just weave it into a case for Bitcoin from first principles. And the first principles being that money is this story told by mankind. You could also call it a social construct, it\u2019s like a social technology. And something like the calendar, right? A calendar is a social technology related to that which has an interesting connection to time. Probably many of the listeners have read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari. Harari calls these the imaginary constructs that humanity is able to generate these abstractions or useful fictions around which we can orient and concert human action. So these include money, the nation state, human rights, various abstractions. And this ability to generate imagined orders and fight and die for a symbol, basically, is what makes humanity the dominant species in the world. A gorilla troop can mobilize 150 gorillas or whatever to go to battle, but humanity can unite tens of thousands of soldiers under a flag! So we gain this ability to allocate human energy and socioeconomic across space and time in a more precise, directed, and concerted fashion by using symbols or stories than any other animal in the world. Ergo, we dominate the world! [06:15] So in that sense, money is probably the most important story mankind has ever told! It is the original social construct. And that piece attempts to go through the evolution of money, how it\u2019s changed over time, and how it\u2019s actually a tool for storing and transacting time, and you could say time or energy \u2014 because everything mankind produces requires time or energy. And another way to think about money is as the most tradable asset in an economy and the most liquid asset, so it represents a claim on everything else. It can be traded for anything else man\u2019s time or energy can produce. So it is this timeless story or timeless social construct, but it also reflects the storage of mankind\u2019s time and energy in a tradable form."}

I think Naval has described humanity as the networked species. And the simple case that humanity is more productive under a cooperative division of labor \u2014 meaning that there\u2019s this kernel to economics called the comparative advantage, which is: you make hats faster than I make boots\u2014you and I both benefit by specializing in hats and boots respectively and trading with one another. We increase output per man-hour of hats and boots by specializing and trading. And we need one another. We are more productive functioning inter-dependently than we are in isolation. That\u2019s the thing! You could almost think of us as a collective organism in a way. We can satisfy more individual wants cooperating than we can living in isolation. And you can\u2019t avoid that! It\u2019s math, right? All the luxuries that we enjoy today, no man could singularly produce them. Another great book that goes into this is The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley. And he talks about a computer mouse in the first chapter. And he says that there is no individual on Earth that knows how to make a computer mouse! No one! No one can do it! It\u2019s this complex configuration of trade networks and specialization and learning and heuristics and tools and resources and technologies that all inter-connect in this network that output the computer mouse. But you cannot pluck any human on Earth off the Earth and put him on a desert island and say, Build a computer mouse! There\u2019s no one that could do it! So we need one another! Social cooperation is the advantage by which we become more productive and wealthy."}

And I think the key lesson from your writings is time preference and it really helped me understand that. And maybe you could talk about how individuals can build prosperity through generations. Maybe talking about Harold and Louis and the fishing pole. And I just thought that was remarkable where first we had the micro, and I think that was where I was in 2019, just to kind of lead the story a little bit of where they\u2019re kind of figuring out where they\u2019re gonna specialize or spend their time. And when I revisited it or think about it more deeper it\u2019s really the macro over generations!"}

So we\u2019re building \u2014 as we trade and specialize, each of the trading partners then gets additional free time. They get the same level output in the same time, therefore they have basically discovered this new amount of time in their day, and they can spend that time producing further or they could spend it in leisure. But if you produce further, then you create more time savings, and there\u2019s a compounding effect. And it builds itself in layers throughout history. So the simple example of that which is in Money, Bitcoin, and Time, and this is one that came out of The Bitcoin Standard, is \u2014 I gave the example of two primitive trading partners, Harold and Louis. Actually it was named H and L to signify Harold, with a high time preference \u2014 meaning he\u2019s more short-term oriented \u2014 and then Louis, with a low time preference \u2014 which means he\u2019s more long-term oriented. And both Harold and Louis are alone on an island. They subsist by eating fish. They both start just catching fish with their bare hands. And they can basically spend eight hours a day catching fish with their bare hands \u2014 enough to fill their belly for the day. So it\u2019s a full days work for a full days food, essentially. Louis, having the lower time preference, thinking out into the future of how he can bootstrap himself out of this primitive situation, decides that he can forego eating \u2014 he can go a little bit hungry a few days a week \u2014 maybe he could only fish six hours a day and have a little extra two hours of fasting at the end of every day, and spend those two hours constructing a fishing rod! And I think the example is, at the end of two weeks, Louis has successfully constructed a fishing rod that now allows him to collect a full days worth of fish in say three hours. Whereas Harold, with a high time preference, is still spending eight hours a day just to eat! So now all of a sudden Louis is saying, Alright, I\u2019m catching as many fish as Harold in just three hours of work using this fishing rod. I\u2019m full, I\u2019ve got enough food for the day, I\u2019ve now got this five additional hours that I could spend doing whatever I want. So he could just take that and be lazy! But again, he\u2019s Louis! He\u2019s got a low time preference \u2014 he\u2019s thinking about the future! So he\u2019s like, I figure I\u2019m gonna go out and build a net, or construct a boat, or all these other tools that help you catch more fish per man-hour. This process feeds back on itself, and then before you know it, it\u2019s Harold sitting by the river bank spending eight hours a day subsisting on fish. Louis is out to sea in his boat with his net, his spear, his harpoon \u2014 everything he\u2019s developed \u2014 and he\u2019s catching not only more fish per man-hour, but fish in the deeper sea so he\u2019s catching higher quality fish! He\u2019s improving his quality of life! And then if he passes these lessons on to the next generation, and the next generation is born with all the advantages \u2014 all the capital and learnings that he\u2019s accumulated over his lifetime \u2014 then they can start that process again from the boat! And then this process builds throughout history until you have these giant fishing ships we have that go into the deep sea and lay trawls of net for miles and miles, and bring back millions of fish they sell on the market. So this is the compounding effect that a lower time preference gives you. And this points to the kernel of all economics, which is delayed gratification. You\u2019re consuming less today to create savings for tomorrow. Or to innovate to create more savings for tomorrow. And it\u2019s these layers of savings that civilization is built on!"}

I do want to turn to some more of the macro of price signals. We\u2019ve talked a little about time preference and the micro, but the price signals \u2014 why are those so important in terms of like a unit of account?"}
{"link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bitcoin-matrix/id1534519469?i=1000506563929", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast \u2014 Robert Breedlove: Bitcoin, the Tyranny of Time Scarcity & the Masters & Slaves of Mone\u202ay", "text": "Robert Breedlove [16:01]: Yeah there\u2019s actually a number of ways to look at this. First of all I have to define what a price is. And I like to relate this to language, actually. It\u2019s kind of like the price signal, you can think of as an economic telecommunications network! So the price is just saying that everything\u2019s trading in the world, and so everything trades at some ratio of everything else. A house may be worth eleven cars, or a car might be worth ten hot dogs. Everything trades at a ratio of everything else. These exchange ratios clearly would be very complicated if that\u2019s how we traded. We\u2019d always have these barter exchange ratios! So what happens in an economy is \u2014 again that most tradable asset which is by definition money \u2014 everything gets priced in terms of money. And this simplifies trading in terms of calculation, execution, negotiation, and so what you have there is a mechanism of comparison, and this is similar to language in that words have sense in relation to one another. There\u2019s an argument that you can trace it all the way back to where someone is holding up a rock and saying, Rock, and that word doesn\u2019t have meaning in relation to words, it has meaning to the rock. And that\u2019s true, but once you further out into the linguistic sphere, you have context and grammar and syntax \u2014 all these things are relational. So we\u2019re deriving meaning from language, based on the relationship and configuration of words. The same is true in our economy: we derive meaning from human action based on the configuration of prices. So people are going into the world staking their time, energy, capital, in an attempt to solve problems or satisfy wants for others, and the game is to generate more outputs than you made inputs. So I put in X time, energy, capital, that has a certain market value. I want to create a product or a service or a piece of knowledge that earns me more time, money, and capital in the end. But all those decisions are guided by the decisions of others. Everyone is competing to satisfy wants for one another over time, so the price is the informational bearer on how much things cost! How much are inputs and outputs worth! So this entire system is what coordinates entrepreneurial action. So this game we\u2019re all playing where we\u2019re trying to figure out, How to better satisfy the wants of people? How do I improve human productivity? How do I render value to people? We just define value as whatever people want! So there\u2019s a lot of wants out there, and you go out and satisfy them profitably. That is the game of economics, and that game is governed by prices. So that is the informational signal that is propagating throughout the economy. What\u2019s incredible about it is that it adds so much efficiency to decision-making! And the simple example there was, if there was an earthquake in Chile that disrupted the flow of copper, all the market actors in the world \u2014 no one needs to know the why, no one needs to know about the earthquake, no one needs to know about the destruction \u2014 they just need to see that the price of copper went up! By that occurring, you\u2019ve changed the incentive structure for all users of copper. So people buying copper will either buy less or they\u2019ll seek substitutes, and all the producers of copper will produce more, because the market\u2019s bearing a higher price for it! So this market signal is how economic systems coordinate themselves and correct disruptions. So this disruption in the flow of copper into the world economy would be self-regulated or self-corrected through the price signal! And all done in a way that you don\u2019t need to sit down with a simple planning committee and say, Hey! There was a disruption to the flow of copper, we need to decide how much we\u2019re gonna send here and there. The other way to think about this is, the free market is the ultimate distributed computing network! We\u2019re all inter-connected by the price signal. Each individual node \u2014 which is each individual human or entrepreneur \u2014 they have maximal knowledge of their localized situation, right? You know, whatever business you\u2019re in, you know that business better than anyone else, and you\u2019re communicating information about that business into your market through your buying and selling decisions. That\u2019s constantly reshaping the price signal for others, and the same thing\u2019s happening from all other nodes, so you\u2019re getting information back to the price signal. So it\u2019s a self-organizing economic network communicated through the price signal. So it\u2019s like the nerve signal of the world economy, is another way to think about it."}

So we laid out a little bit about the economic gamification of money and how we\u2019re networked. But now we need a kind of way to keep score, so you need a ledger! Before we get to Bitcoin, we\u2019ve actually had an example of a transparent ledger before on a very small scale on the Yap Islands. If you would maybe talk a little bit about how they kept track of money through the Rai stones in a transparent way?"}
{"link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bitcoin-matrix/id1534519469?i=1000506563929", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast \u2014 Robert Breedlove: Bitcoin, the Tyranny of Time Scarcity & the Masters & Slaves of Mone\u202ay", "text": "Robert Breedlove [22:08]: Yeah! So that was a super interesting ancient monetary system because it most closely resembled what we see with the Bitcoin open source ledger, basically! Rai stones were giant stones, like you couldn\u2019t move them by hand, it took dozens of guys to retrieve these things \u2014 I think from quarries. And they had a very particular shape. There was a significant amount of work necessary to procure them, which we could think of as akin to the Proof-of-Work that limited their supply. So you couldn\u2019t just print Rai stones \u2014 that was very important! So they had scarcity in the marketplace. But they lacked some other monetary properties like divisibility and portability. You couldn\u2019t move them easily \u2014 these are giant, multi-ton rocks. You couldn\u2019t divide them easily. So the Yap Islanders kept track of it with an open source ledger, effectively! Everyone on the marketplace would trade, and then when they would decide that part of the stone had been traded for some other good or service, they would announce this \u2014 literally verbally announce this to the marketplace \u2014 everyone had their own individual ledger, and they would record the trades. So that was a distributed ledger, effectively, that truth was established by consensus, and then no one could go and change their individual ledger and say, Oh this trade didn\u2019t happen! Because then it wouldn\u2019t reconcile to the others. So it\u2019s very similar to what Bitcoin does, in that \u2014 that\u2019s what every node and miner in the world was doing \u2014 it\u2019s checking the work of every other node and miner. Consensus is reached in a distributed fashion! Was that the original question?"}

To continue that thought, that was hard money at first! Hard in the sense that it was hard to produce, hard to forge, not hard in the sense that it was a rock, but hard in the sense that it was hard to procure, until David O\u2019Keefe arrived, and turned hard money into what we would call soft money today."}

And we\u2019ve seen this a number of times throughout history. Another example are the glass beads in Africa. But historically, markets have tried to zero on the asset that best satisfies the properties of money. And we can think about this as the services money renders! We want money that can be divisible, durable, recognizable, portable, and scarce. In the case of the Yap Islanders, they had figured out a system that satisfied those five properties, that provided those five services. However, once O\u2019Keefe arrived, he basically technologically disrupted this monetary system, because he had dynamite, he had boats, he could go out and quarry these rocks much more cheaply, so therefore he could compromise the scarcity of the money, and use it to acquire things in the market and diminish the value of the money. And that\u2019s exactly what happened! I think it was coconut oil that he was trying to procure from them? And he saw that they were using these stones as money. He realized that he could go back and get some dynamite, come here, mine huge quantities of these stones very easily, and then use it to acquire a ton of coconuts and then you could go sell these back in a different market. And glossing over some of the detail, that\u2019s more or less what happened. The Yap Islanders tried to resist initially, but he was able to get through to a few of them. And then the entire monetary system collapsed! So the lesson there is: if someone can produce a money more cheaply than others, they essentially control the monetary system, or they can disrupt it down to the point of the cost of production of that money. And we see a similar dynamic with central banking today. Where they\u2019re producing money at zero cost, confiscating wealth from all users of the money, and driving it into the ground, frankly, over time!"}

And moving towards what the world considered to be the standard, and how that might have affected their societies from a wealth preservation perspective?"}

So they\u2019re good canaries in the coal mine, I think historically, for what we will see for countries and groups that resist Bitcoin going forward. As Saifedean brilliantly says \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna paraphrase it \u2014 history shows that it is impossible to ignore the consequences of someone else holding a money that is harder than yours! So this inflation-resistant quality of money, it is a game that imposes itself! You can\u2019t just isolate yourself or your economy or your nation from someone else holding a harder money than you, because what will effectively happen is that there\u2019s more demand from a money that holds its value across time, so capital will be absorbed by a hard money economy, making them wealthier relative to the softer money economy, giving the hard money economy the advantage over the soft money economy. And the example there was China and India obstinately holding out on the silver standard while the world was moving to a gold standard, and it just kept playing out! England was I think the first to move to the gold standard, and then the game theory kept playing itself out that other countries realized that they had to adopt a gold standard to remain competitive, and then eventually it was China and India were the two players remaining on the silver standard. And that\u2019s why England was able to colonize much of India! It basically became an English commonwealth, because you had English people on a gold standard able to go in and buy vast amounts of Indian capital and land and resources. And then control it for many generations! Similar thing played out in China, but I believe that led to the Maoist revolution, actually. That there was such a breakdown on wealth that they eventually had a revolution. I might be mixing the chronology up there but the moral of the story is: China was economically plundered by remaining on the silver standard relative to countries that moved on to the gold standard. So in a Bitcoin lens it\u2019s similar \u2014 the game theory is: it cannot be ignored or argued away! It\u2019s: whoever holds the hardest money is going to accumulate the most economic value."}

I mean, had they adopted the gold standard much earlier I think it would have changed their entire history! They would have been much more powerful and wealthier today. There would have been a lot less suffering between then and now, but as good as gold was, the Achilles\u2019 heel is that it still introduced the need to trust the custodians. Trust the banks. And the economies of scale associated with transacting \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s very heavy and difficult to move around \u2014 so there\u2019s a big cost associated with transacting with gold. So this led to the centralization of custody. And then governments \u2014 which have the monopoly on violence \u2014 they inevitably co-opt the gold supply such that it can become a revenue stream for the treasury. They can just borrow whatever they need! And that\u2019s why the gold standard always breaks down and ends up in fiat, in my opinion. Because these custodians \u2014 it\u2019s absolute power corrupts absolutely! You give a custodian absolute power over the gold supply, they inevitably issue more bank notes or warehouse receipts than the gold reserves can justify, and the entire standard becomes compromised over time! Again it compromises scarcity of money by abstracting it in a paper currency. So as good as good was as a force for civilization, this Achilles\u2019 heel always led to its ultimate abuse and breakdown."}

You\u2019re never gonna take on a fair fight in the real wild. And is some of this interplay between countries and fiat and money just part of nature? And I ask that from a \u2014 obviously we would get more if we collaborated, and I do think reciprocity is a big part of our internal nature! But maybe not within the most ambitious or politically connected or powerful people \u2014 I\u2019m not sure.

I\u2019m tempted to just cover it at a high level here. So in nature \u2014 and this is all organisms \u2014 one of the most deeply rooted primordial organic impulses is the territorial imperative. So animals want to take territory, protect territory, and so you could say they seek to expand their dominion over space, but I argue too that \u2014 again, as Einstein taught us, space and time are the same thing \u2014 it also applies to time. So animals seek to increase their genetic dominion over time, which is reproduction. We\u2019re all trying to reproduce and spread genes as far and wide as possible. The territorial imperative of biology is expressed in man as property rights. This is how we determine who owns what in the world. Who owns what space, who owns command over other peoples\u2019 time. This is all embodied in what property rights you have accumulated for yourself. The highest property right in an economy is money. It is the meta-property right that holds claim to all other property rights. So that is the deep connection I think here. And that\u2019s why people are crazy about money, by the way. If you\u2019ve ever who\u2019s lost money, or money can also make people crazy, it\u2019s getting to the deep circuitry of who we are! And to that end I do think that our modes of social organization, they can exhibit these predator and prey dynamics, where you\u2019ll see \u2014 again it\u2019s all about inputs and outputs at the end of the day. We think individually and individually we are compassionate, by the way, with our local group, and what people do well \u2014 we want to have reciprocal altruism in all of these things. However that compassion does not scale! Again, back to the Dunbar number that\u2019s kind of the limit of what organic societies can mobilize with apps and collective imagined order like we described earlier. You can\u2019t really scale biologically beyond that Dunbar number of 150 or so odd people. So if you look at nations or some larger groups, it would be a lot more cutthroat! So if there\u2019s a way that the collective can earn more outputs from \u2014 if there\u2019s a way for individuals operating a collective like state governors or military officials, they can input less energy than they can get in output. So they can enforce a monopoly on violence and impose taxation that costs them X, and then they get tax revenue that equals X + 1, they will do that, right? It\u2019s an economics game! It\u2019s not how you feel about the people, it\u2019s very ruthless in that way. So in that way that\u2019s what I think you see happen throughout history with this disruption of monetary orders, economics game. And that\u2019s what drives the market by the way! To zero in on the money that is most resistant to theft, supply manipulation, because at the end of the day, people have learned through these countless market iterations that, I need to store my wealth \u2014 this accumulation of time and energy savings, the fruits of my labor \u2014 I need to store it in a form of money that can\u2019t be inflated, confiscated, deauthorized, and that money was gold! It was trust-minimized money is another way to say it. So that\u2019s what made gold, gold. But again the drawback was the custody and portability issue. Gold was an insufficient [inaudible 37:13] so we couldn\u2019t move it easily, we couldn\u2019t beam it over telecommunication channels, so it did not keep up. It forced us to need to trust custodians to warehouse that gold and maintain that currency peg 1:1, that trust is always abused until it falters. To get to why the US had established itself as the gold standard is again about gold. In World War II, every time Nazi Germany would invade a country, the first place they would go is straight to that country\u2019s central bank and hoard their gold reserves. They did this in Poland, they did this with a few others. And very quickly many European countries wised up to this and said, We need to ship our gold out and store it somewhere that Nazis can\u2019t plunder, and it just so happened by geographic happenstance that North America became that safe haven! So as a result of World War II, a lot of gold \u2014 most of the world\u2019s [gold] \u2014 ends up in North America, and then surprise, surprise, end of the war, US steps in, [passes] the remaining opponents that are all war-weary, they\u2019ve been fighting, they\u2019re resources are diminished, and US is holding all the gold, so we sent out people in, we finished the job, we then hold a peace conference to rewrite the banking system rules to our own favor. So we say that the US dollar will be pegged to gold, all other national currencies will be pegged to the US dollar, so we\u2019re on this gold standard, but it\u2019s a gold standard that the US controls, because now the world is trusting the US to be the gold custodian effectively in this model. And that was 1944. 30 years later, the world sees that the US is producing way too many dollars than its gold reserves can justify, countries start demanding settlement in gold. They want to sell their dollars and repatriate gold. And eventually it gets to a point where the US says, We\u2019ve had enough of this! And they stop, they close the gold window in the infamous 1971 Nixon shock. I think it was Germany that tried to repatriate their gold when the US decided that they didn\u2019t have enough. And that moved the world into this totally uncharted territory of a global fiat standard. And if you just look at the socioeconomic data ever since, things have gotten really bad in a lot of ways."}

It blew me away! And I\u2019m a guy that\u2019s been staring at this and just to see it happen I was completely floored! So I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for others, it\u2019s gotta be similar at least. We see another dynamic similar to the Yap Islanders in that aggry beads were small decorative glass beads that were used as money for centuries in Western Africa. This is around the 16th century that Europeans begin landing on African shores. They\u2019re doing expeditions both exploratory and trading expeditions. And shrewd Europeans discern that, Hey! These Africans are using these small glass beads as money! There\u2019s glass-making facilities back in Europe that I can mass-produce these things. I can counterfeit these things en masse and I can bring these things into the market and acquire all of these goods and services that the African economy can offer, basically at a discount. So just like O\u2019Keefe collapsing the production cost of Rai stones with the Yap Islanders, Europeans are able to collapse the production cost of aggry beads in Western Africa and thereby use it as a mechanism for confiscating their wealth. To your point earlier, if wealth is just this accumulation of time saved or it\u2019s frozen time, we could say both money and capital are both a form of frozen time or energy, and time and energy has to be invested to create them. And then capital and money \u2014 money could be used to claim time from other people, capital can be used to improve your productivity which is to say to increase your returns on time spent. You can dig a hole faster per man hour with a shovel than you can with bare hands, you can catch more fish per hour with a fishing rod than you can with your bare hands, etc. So what happened was a surreptitious confiscation of African wealth over time, that these expeditions kept coming in. Africans actually could discern a little bit that some of these beads were counterfeit and there was a little bit of resistance at times, but that just fed back into better counterfeiting, and before you know it it became all mixed up of capital from Africa into the hands of Europeans was just tremendous over time! But this was a little more painful because it was slow and surreptitious. Versus the Yap Islander situation that was small and quick so that it was able to sort itself out. This one was much more of a parasitic long term relationship where it wasn\u2019t evident to African traders what was happening! They were just getting impoverished slowly over time as a result of this relationship. And the net outcome of that was impoverished Africans. Slavery was already practiced in Africa, so eventually they started selling slaves to Europeans, they started selling one another, family members, everything. And this catalyzed the trans-Atlantic slave trade. So the point here is that it\u2019s not just a metaphor to say that stealing money is stealing human time. It\u2019s not just a metaphor! It directly contributes in this instance\u2014the stealing of human time through compromising the money supply directly contributed to the direct theft of human time in the form of slavery. And the trans-Atlantic slave trade was just an atrocious thing! It was 365 years, 12.5 million lives stolen directly from African shores shipped to Europe and the America, 2 million of those died in transit in the infamous Middle Passage. It still has effects in the United States and Europe today. Not only were those lives stolen directly, but their children were born into slavery, this led to the Civil Rights movement in the 60\u2019s, all of these cascading socioeconomic consequences were rooted in [inaudible 47:13]. So the big argument there is an exclusive privilege to produce money without accountability to market forces is an apparatus of enslavement, and that\u2019s exactly what central banking is. They are counterfeiting currency to the benefit of their own shareholders at the expense of everyone else. So my argument there is central banking is the black corps in the world today that leads us towards more totalitarian government, and ultimately we\u2019ll see situations like we saw in Soviet Russia at some point if it goes unchecked! So humanity has to wake up to this truth! We cannot keep enslaving one another and counterfeiting currency which leads to enslavement, and hope to build a sustainable civilization \u2014 it\u2019s just not possible!"}

I\u2019d like to stack some numbers up side by side. You touched on it a little bit before, but it\u2019s like, the Trans-Atlantic slave trade \u2014 and I hate to break down these calculations into time and economics, but I think it\u2019s important to benchmark things \u2014 6.8 billion hours of human time per year was stolen over 365 years. You\u2019re talking about 2.5 trillion hours of time stolen! Not even including the progeny, the people that died. And you think about Harold and Louis, and each one of those individuals could have been a Louis, and could have been part of building a dynasty or some sort of citadel for their family or foundation or prosperity. And that was taken away. And then you see even more egregious scenarios where you have these unfair fights where now you move from aggry beads to cloth strips. I think it\u2019s Portugal, is fabricating and counterfeiting cloth strips which are money in parts of Africa, they\u2019re buying slaves with the fabricated cloth strips \u2014 some of these slaves happened to be weavers of cloth strips! Now indentured slaves are brought to Portugal, where they\u2019re now building an economy around taking indentured slaves and having them produce the counterfeit goods that are then enslaving their own people. And it just cycles through! I\u2019d be curious to hear how that benchmarks against 40 years of being off of the gold standard? And I think that these are really big connections! You said something earlier before where \u2014 and I slightly disagree with you in terms of like, People are listening or learning \u2014 I\u2019m not convinced that this is getting through to the masses \u2014 all of these examples! That\u2019s why I really beat them! I want to highlight them! Because they\u2019re not taught in school, they\u2019re not even taught in higher education and universities \u2014 the history of money and how we chose gold, and what makes good money. It\u2019s interesting though because you can see signs that people understand this over time. You have music like in 1971 you have Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues, talking about inflation, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s getting through or that this kind of ethos is really connecting with people! Even now Bitcoin is accelerating and more people are asking me about it in a positive light, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re connecting aggry beads and fiat! But if we could just benchmark a little bit of how you see the time theft through fiat money printing. And the lenses there is that, if you can make glass beads for essentially free, if you can make cloth for free, and if you could make money for free, what does that mean? And then just kind of benchmark it."}

One way to think about it is the exchange value of money will converge to its production cost over time. So if it only costs you next to nothing to make a cloth strip or a glass bead, there\u2019s an incentive to spend that money buying goods and services until market exchange value reaches production cost \u2014 until you\u2019ve inflated it down to its production cost. And that also explains the incentive scheme behind fiat currency. It\u2019s literally a keystroke in a centralized ledger. We say printing money often, but they don\u2019t even print money as much as they used to! It\u2019s more about a keystroke of entering new reserves into a bank balance is pyramided on top of to increase the money supply. So I quantify the Trans-Atlantic slave trade to benchmark the Fed against just the US central bank \u2014 not looking at the other central banks around the world. And you can develop a proxy for the amount of time stolen from the productive economy through quantitative easing, or money printing. And the data I used to do this were the average hourly wage rate per year \u2014 this is from the Social Security Administration in the US \u2014 I looked at the changes in US M2, which is the money supply year over year in the US. You can then divide that change \u2014 that increase in the money supply \u2014 divided by the average hourly wage rate. It gives you a proxy for how many hours were stolen. That\u2019s basically: What is the market rate per hour of the average worker? How much money did the government print that year? That\u2019s how many hours were stolen, because when a government prints money, there\u2019s no fair trade there. They\u2019re not adding any productive assets into the economy. They\u2019re not putting any assets in, they\u2019re not adding any human time, no ingenuity \u2014 nothing. It\u2019s just a reallocation on the claims of the productive factors in an economy from the hands of one to another. From the hands of society to the hands of the government, or the central bank you could say more specifically. And when you stack this over \u2014 I only looked back 40 years, 1981\u20132020 \u2014 the average hours stolen per year by just the US central bank, the Fed, came out to 23.4 billion hours per year stolen for 40 years straight! So this was two and a third as many as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, 6.5 billion hours per year. I guess it\u2019s closer to four times, actually! Three to four times more hours stolen per year than the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. And over the course of 40 years, the total calculus came out to almost 1 trillion human hours stolen by the Fed in 40 years of money printing. And then if you quantify that back to the workforce number, it\u2019s as if the Fed had a slave force of about 11.7 million people for 40 years straight, breaking down the hours to the number of people needed to satisfy those hours. For a long time I took a great deal of reticence to talk about central banking in this way, because it is distinctly different from physical bondage, where there are chains and whips and violence that\u2019s very visceral and real. Inflationary monetary policy driven by central banks is something much less visible than that, much harder to identify, but because of that invisibility, the tradeoff is that it\u2019s done at a much larger scale! It\u2019s three to four times as much as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, looking at just one central bank! So it\u2019s bad! What else can you call systemic time theft other than slavery? When you look at it through this lens I think it gives you a frame of reference on what\u2019s truly wrong in the world today! We have theft at a minimum, slavery at a maximum, integrated directly into the prevailing economic order. And it may sound crazy, it may sound tinfoil hat, but just a quick study of the history of humanity \u2014 we\u2019ve always had systems of slavery, always! \u2014 every civilization has enslaved someone else. It\u2019s been the norm \u2014 the vast majority have used slaves. We\u2019ve just figured out a way to really scale it and hide it in a more sophisticated way than we\u2019ve ever done before, in the institution of central banking."}

And I think part of that to be honest is, one of your quotes \u2014 I think you maybe said it on Stephan Livera \u2014 Acquire human labor on the market at an unfair price. That\u2019s a really interesting way to put it! I think what makes that really hard to grok is that, one, what make it really hard to grok at first in 2019 was, I\u2019m a huge benefactor I believe of this sin or this scam or this heist! And I\u2019m not incentivized \u2014 I wasn\u2019t incentivized in 2019 in my mind to do anything about it! I was a big beneficiary of it. I don\u2019t philosophically. I don\u2019t mean from justice. I wasn\u2019t for it, but it wasn\u2019t really in my best interest to find this as a truth! And it was shocking! And in the two years since, I now feel like what used to be an exported heist is now turned inward. Because we can no longer take advantage of what\u2019s going on outside of our borders to the degree that we have, both through physical force and through fiat central banking human ranching or farming. Now I feel that it\u2019s turned inward, and that\u2019s where I think it really started to click at a deeper level. One of the things you say is, More accurately, money, along with its precursors, action and speech, are the root of all sovereignty. So do you think we\u2019re fully sovereign in the US?"}

They\u2019re distracting people, people are still caught up in this hallucination that it\u2019s red versus blue, conservative versus liberal, when in fact they all serve the central bank master! But I would argue that I\u2019m less concerned about \u2014 I mean clearly it would be great to wake people up immediately, but these things take time. So the way I see things playing out is: the more money is printed, the more abusive the system becomes, the more demand will be driven for encryption technologies, self-sovereign solutions, Bitcoin, frankly \u2014 people want to store their wealth in a place it cannot be confiscated, manipulated, abused, inflated. And the experience that I\u2019ve gone through falling into the Bitcoin rabbit hole: where your money goes your mind follows \u2014 as with the experience you\u2019ve gone through \u2014 it changes people over time. So my longer term vision and bet is that over the next 10, 20, 30 years, you\u2019re gonna have a massive awakening that the state is just a giant scam! It\u2019s a huge fraudulent organization. It abuses people. And now people have this ability to fight back in an unprecedented way with digital technologies: they can self-organize, you can move your capital in a system parallel to a legacy financial system, you can escape capital controls, you can do all \u2014 so that gets into the whole Sovereign Individual thesis, which I always mention this book. I\u2019m writing an essay series on it now, it\u2019s gonna be a 12-part series more or less covering one part per chapter in the book, plus one extra part covering Bitcoin specifically. I\u2019m arguing that we\u2019re transcending this false statist dichotomy between capitalism and communism, and that Bitcoin enables a new mode of socioeconomic organization I\u2019m calling Sovereignism. And that encryption technology \u2014 which is at the heart of the Internet, Bitcoin, and other tools that I think we\u2019ll see coming down the pipe in the coming years, this is inherently disruptive to the state. It gives people a level of sovereignty that\u2019s never before been possible! We needed a large monopoly on violence to preserve the peace and protect property rights in a trading economy before, but now a lot of these functions that the state was necessary for in the analog stages can be satisfactorily provided by software in the digital age. So we\u2019re in a Renaissance, really. The transition from the agricultural age into the industrial age or the fall of the feudal age \u2014 these things in retrospect they\u2019re major transitions, but no one saw them coming! If you\u2019re living in feudal society, you just think this is just the world, and the way it\u2019s just gonna be forever. The printing press is invented\u201410 million books are printed in a year. [inaudible] These ages are getting shorter and shorter. Agricultural age is much longer than the industrial age, the industrial age is much longer than the information age that we\u2019re moving into. Technology, as its innovation cycles accelerate, our organizational cycles accelerate, because society is a reflection of the technologies used to facilitate it! So we\u2019ve moved from large scale industrial tech, which necessitated a large scale nation state, to small scale microprocessing and digital technology, which will enable small scale self-organization. Who knows where this goes! But I think it\u2019s abundantly clear by this point that digital changes everything! Software is eating the world, and government is not immune to that!"}

And the choices they have to make at that micro-level, in dealing with inflation."}

One way to think about prices is as an element that determines where attention is warranted. So if the price if something is increasing, that represents an unsatisfied want in the market economy \u2014 there is more demand than there is supply for this good or service. And so by extension, Bitcoin is a clear example of this. When a price of something goes up, attention is drawn to is. People pay attention to price changes. And you could say that the element for drawing attention is that the demand is outstripping supply, so there\u2019s an unsatisfied want there. So this draws the attention of producers in the marketplace to go and try to solve that want. The opposite would also be true, that if the price is declining, it\u2019s sort of descending away, it\u2019s getting less attention. It would indicate that a want is being satisfied more efficiently and effectively, and producers or entrepreneurs would pay less than that. Again in terms of the connection between price and attention, Bitcoin\u2019s a great example of that. Every time the price goes up or down, that\u2019s when it gets attention or less attention. So in that way, centralized bodies producing money, they\u2019re inflating the nominal price of assets or goods or everything, right? There\u2019s more dollars. The example that I gave is a wine maker operating in a central banking economy, who essentially faces three courses of action when a central bank prints money. The assumption is that he\u2019s selling his wine for $20 a bottle to begin with, so he knows that, Okay, say the central bank doubled the money supply, just assume inflation is even \u2014 it\u2019s not actually even in the world but for simplicity\u2019s sake \u2014 assume that his inputs are gonna effectively double in price. He has three choices: He can continue selling his wine for $20 a bottle and eat the loss \u2014 his cost of inputs has doubled but he keeps his price the same \u2014 he eats the loss due to inflation, he can choose to double the price of his wine to $40 a bottle, which will keep his margin constant \u2014 so the cost of inputs has doubled, he doubles his selling price, his margin is constant \u2014 or, he could water down his wine, or use cheaper ingredients, a lower quality products but he keeps selling it at $20 a bottle to preserve some of that margin. So faced with those three options, clearly he\u2019s not gonna take the loss. If he increases his price to $40 a bottle which would be the honest thing to do frankly, he is creating more attention, right? He\u2019s increased the price of wine, so he\u2019s drawing more attention from competitors that will look to sell that bottle at a higher price as well, and then those competitors might not be as honest as him! They may choose to sell the wine at a higher price or even a lower price and compromise on quality, so he\u2019s left with kind of this third choice, because even if he\u2019s honest he\u2019s probably gonna lose some business to competitors \u2014 because he\u2019s had to increase his price by double\u2014and then his competitors can hide some of that cost through again, cheaper lower quality ingredients. So he\u2019s sort of incentivized to deceive his customers in the short run! Now over time this would work itself out because his reputation \u2014 say he would have a reputation for a certain quality of wine \u2014 he would then be diminishing that quality which over time his reputation would be diminished as well. But it would take time for this to occur. So the moral of the story is: inflation is forcing producers to be more short term oriented. Again in raising their time preference. Which also encourages them to deceive their customers in the short run. They\u2019re thinking less about their long term reputation, more about their immediate financial profitability. And as a result of theft integrated in the money supply, inflation integrated directly into the money supply, producers of all sorts are forced to weigh their moral and financial [costs] in this way, they\u2019re gonna have to hold each one in each hand and decide, Am I gonna put food on the table and a roof over my head for my family, or am I gonna compromise a little bit [to run a better] business? So it\u2019s that mode by which I argue inflation is a cancer on the socioeconomic and moral fabric of reality. And again if civilization is [characterized] by the lowering of its time preference and the broadening of its time horizons, inflation is causing us to become less civilized, more deceptive, more short term oriented in general. And I think you can see this again back to https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/ inflation screws up society really bad!"}

And we\u2019ve had some discussions about it but I think it\u2019s really interesting that humanity is subject to these cycles that are \u2014 I mean I don\u2019t know where they come from, they\u2019re just these super-seasons almost, these 70-year turnings. And I don\u2019t know where they come from but I find it very interesting! Dalio\u2019s economic cycles are interesting too, but I would argue that a lot of them are driven by this vulnerability of money to be co-opted, to have its scarcity compromised, which incentivizes people to accumulate debt. If your money is losing money every year, then you\u2019re incentivized to take out debt in current dollars, and let the inflation diminish your real debt burden over time, so again it flips, it inverts the incentives of money, where typically the incentives of money are to create savings. Savings undergird investment, investment improves time preference. So we\u2019re actually thinking longer term, we\u2019re becoming more civilized. Fiat currency inverts that entire situation. And I think most of Dalio\u2019s work is focused on that aspect of money, that it\u2019s been repeatedly abused and pushed to be a more debt-based money over time, and then you get these huge inflationary booms, which is actually just a giant misallocation of capital. People are starting projects that they think they can profitably complete, but it\u2019s all a result of a distorted price signal, and then once reality comes into play, it collapses! So this is the Austrian business cycle theory, that fiat currency distorts price signals and exacerbates the boom and bust business cycle. And I think Dalio\u2019s work really just \u2014 without saying it \u2014 measures and focuses on that. Saying that fiat currency is disturbing the standard business cycle. Which the standard business cycle would just be, people are always gonna get hyped up, overexuberant about something and it\u2019s gonna get a correction. That\u2019s normal! Growth is inherently unstable. But fiat currency fuels that fire and exacerbates it tremendously!"}

Alchemy again back to moderns \u2014 we think that alchemy is a joke \u2014 it\u2019s a bunch of people that thought they could turn lead into gold and it never worked? Not at all what it was! It was basically the precursor to the Scientific Revolution. Carl Jung says that alchemy was the dream from which science was born. You know I\u2019ve only got like five minutes left here so I can\u2019t dive into it completely, but I\u2019ll say that I find it very interesting that the highest aim of alchemy was to develop or discover the incorruptible substance. And this substance was to serve as the antidote to tyranny in general. But we would say that most forms of tyranny are state-based at least in the modern age. And I find it very interesting, this connection! The other thing is people think it was about how to turn lead into gold? That was just the symbol of it, actually. To turn lead into gold was to eliminate impurities, to absolutely eliminate impurities, to uncorrupt matter. And in removing corruption from matter there was also this feedback with the soul, the spirit, the character of man. So it would actually be refining our own morality, character, uncorrupting ourselves as we pursued this decorruption of the world, if you will. Again the highest aim was the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, which the alchemists called the lapis philosophorum, it was the incorruptible substance they were seeking. And I find it very interesting the connection to Bitcoin that 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible thing mankind has ever created! We\u2019ve created something that existed beyond our own reach. No one in the world, no entity, no individual, no government, no central bank, can change \u2014 thus far at least, 12 years into Bitcoin\u2019s life , $600 billion in market capitalization\u2014a civil war later, that was Bitcoin Cash it was a Bitcoin fork, there have been a number of attempts to co-opt Bitcoin, to increase supply, increase block size, etc. It\u2019s been hardened through hostility. Thus far it seems as though 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible figure mankind has ever created. And by being incorruptible, the great promise of Bitcoin is to disrupt the greatest institution of tyranny in human history, which is the central bank! So we have an incorruptible substance in Bitcoin, we have an antidote for the corruption of central banking. And if you talk to Bitcoiners that have studied this thing deeply and are active with it intimately, it changes you! Bitcoin changes you! I don\u2019t know how to describe it specifically, everyone has their own flavor of experience of it, but the general theme is that you\u2019re more family focused, you\u2019re more community focused, you\u2019re more purpose driven, more focused on saving, less focused on spending, you\u2019re asking deeper questions, you\u2019re thinking about the world more. It really does have a tremendous impact on the character of those that go down this rabbit hole earnestly. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what it is: is Bitcoin the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, the lapis philosophorum, who knows? I mean this sounds extra crazy tinfoil hat, but I would just say go do the research yourself! Look into it! Most of my knowledge of alchemy came from Jordan Peterson\u2019s book Maps of Meaning, which is a tremendously difficult book but also a very worthwhile read. And we\u2019re existing in a time where ancient wisdom seems to be resurging in the digital age. We get people doing yoga, meditation, ayurvedic medicine, paleo diets, psychedelics like ayahuasca are becoming more important, Bitcoin you can even argue is a form of ancient wisdom in that it\u2019s Austrian economic money. Austrian economics is the ancient wisdom of economics! Whereas Keynesian economics is central bank propaganda, more or less. So maybe this alchemy thing coming back in the digital age too is part of that! I don\u2019t know, but I find it very fascinating!"}

This has been awesome! It\u2019s been a long time since I got to go through all of my old work and think about it again and talk about it, so I appreciate that! You can find me on Twitter\nRobert Breedlove\n. I\u2019ve got a Youtube channel and a podcast, the What Is Money Show. Our first guest was Saylor and the Saylor Series. We\u2019re gonna do similar series like that with the best thinkers in the world, essentially. So my aim is just to sit down with some of the smartest people in the world and talk as long as they want about whatever relevant topic they want. Try to make it something like the intellectual Olympics, something like that, so that they\u2019re very enjoyable to watch. Also on the Twitter page I\u2019ve got a LinkTree that I update frequently which has links to all my work. Thank God For Bitcoin, I co-authored that with seven other co-authors. It\u2019s been very well received! It goes into the moral applications. It\u2019s a moral treatise on Bitcoin told through a Christian lens. It\u2019s not a preachy book. It\u2019s not a super rah-rah Christian book, I think it just makes the moral case for Bitcoin and roots that in some Judeo-Christian mythology. And yeah I feel extremely fortunate to be working in this space! It\u2019s given me purpose. I Tweeted this earlier today: Before Bitcoin I wanted dollars. After Bitcoin I wanted to make a difference. If you let it, Bitcoin will make you more purpose-driven. So I would encourage others to let it! To explore this space deeply and earnestly, and it will make you ask fundamental questions that will transform you!"}

But hey, here we are! And I must say \u2014 for me especially \u2014 this is a fantastic place to be, because the model and the research that I\u2019ve done seems to be getting validated as we speak! It\u2019s a bit too early to call of course, we\u2019re not at the levels we are expecting, but hey it sure goes up, and it goes up at exactly the time that the model predicts \u2014 that is right after the halving or slowly after the halving to our target level.

So we have your OG model, the S2F model, and we\u2019ve also got the S2FX, the cross-asset model. In terms of performance against reality, how would you rate them the two different ones?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [04:52]: Yeah, it\u2019s very well that you say that they\u2019re two different models. And maybe to give listeners some context, especially the new ones \u2014 a lot of new people are getting into this space \u2014 the first stock to flow model was created in March 2019 and it was a time-series model, so it looked at the Bitcoin price and it looked at the stock to flow and measured to quantify scarcity and then there\u2019s a nice correlation between them. And you can extrapolate that into the future and you get to a value that was then quite conversatively estimated at $55,000 end of 2021. And it\u2019s later adusted with new data and other [coin?] correction to $100,000 USD at the end of 2021. So that\u2019s the first model \u2014 the original OG stock to flow model! Then a year later in April 2020 the S2FX model \u2014 the cross-asset model \u2014 was made, and it was basically not a time-series model anymore! So it was a model that also uses the same stock to flow measure for scarcity and looks at market values, but then, across different assets! So Bitcoin is one asset, and I divided four phases \u2014 four phase transitions within Bitcoin. But then it also includes in the model, in the data, and ultimately in the model parameters \u2014 the stock to flow and market value of other assets like gold, real estate, silver, diamonds \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes it very different from the stock to flow model originally, but also more robust if you ask me! The important thing is that price prediction for end of 2021 is also a bit higher \u2014 it\u2019s $288,000 as an average price in that specific four-year period. To be honest, I like both models \u2014 they\u2019re both my babies! But if I had to choose, I would choose the S2FX model, because it\u2019s not a time-series model so it\u2019s more robust. It\u2019s always better to have time out of the equation, because we\u2019ll get maybe into that later, but if you correlate to time-series, there is a big risk of correlation being spurious. And that risk is less if you don\u2019t have time series! The other big thing is that we can now interpolate instead of extrapolate! If you have a time-series model \u2014 it can be the number of transactions, it can be the time itself, it can be the number of Bitcoins in existence \u2014 then you don\u2019t know what the number of transactions in the future are, and to base the prediction on top of that is a risky thing! It\u2019s extrapolation \u2014 it\u2019s based on data that you don\u2019t have in your data set! But the S2FX model, we have gold being at a higher stock to flow, and real estate being at a higher stock to flow and higher value, so we can actually interpolate within the data that is used to fit the model, and that is a very, very strong argument for this S2FX model!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "Stephan Livera [08:19]: And so probably it\u2019s a good point also to discuss some of the critiques of some of the modeling. The thing is, it\u2019s kind of shifted over time, right? And I guess we\u2019re talking about both the different models, but with the S2F, one of the interesting developments was this idea of cointegration, which then later it seems that part has now been shown that we can apply the cointegration test. From your perspective, what does that mean? Does it essentially just mean we don\u2019t have the confidence that would have been provided by cointegration, but you believe that the model might still provide some high-level predictive power? Is that how you would summarize it? Or how would you summarize it?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [09:00]: A bit differently! By the way, I got a lot of critique on the models, which I also invited, because I think the models are only getting better if they\u2019re open sourced and discussed! And the point you mention about cointegration was one of the more interesting and very intelligent discussions! I liked that very much! It\u2019s important to know that it only applies to the first model \u2014 the time-series original S2F model \u2014 and not to the S2FX model. And what it basically does \u2014 it\u2019s a measure that gives you some certainty that it is not a spurious regression, not a spurious correlation. Because there\u2019s always a risk that you find correlation [but] that there is no causation or no relationship at all! It\u2019s just a fake, fake correlation \u2014 that\u2019s always a risk! And to be clear, that is still a risk! It could be, the relation between stock to flow, scarcity, and value, could be spurious\u2014although every day that seems less likely! It is important to make that point! Now with cointegration it\u2019s actually a test, and that test \u2014 if you apply it and it proves cointegration \u2014 then the less likely, it\u2019s not certain, but the less likely the relationship, the correlation, is spurious, is false. So there\u2019s a lot of probability that it\u2019s a causal relation and a correlation that you can use for making predictions! But the discussion was quite interesting because it was actually held with a Dutch guy, an Australian guy, a German guy, and me! There were four people working on the same data and the same test. And first we all did the same test and the test clearly showed cointegration! And cointegration means that the series stick together very closely. The story about the drunk and the dog was made. The drunk goes on the street to walk his dog, the dog is on the lease, the drunk goes everywhere, the dog goes everywhere, but the distance between the drunk and the dog can never be longer than the leash! And that\u2019s what you measure \u2014 the leash! They always stick together, and actually that\u2019s what you see in the data! If you look at the Bitcoin price, it sticks to the model, it tracks the model really really close! And if you do the test, you also measure there is cointegration. But then the German guy said, Well, one of the assumptions of the test is that both variables are stochastic and not deterministic, so they should be random and not predetermined. And of course, stock to flow is predetermined! So we couldn\u2019t apply the test! So although the test showed cointegration, theoretically and practically we cannot use it! But it clearly shows the moving of the price around the model. The test also shows it, but we cannot use it! Yeah, that was the end of it right there! You could say, Okay, we should use another test, or develop another test, because it clearly sticks to the model\u2014the price. But on the other hand, it\u2019s maybe best to be conservative and say that there is no cointegration and probably the relationship is spurious! So, that was the end of that discussion! On the other hand, if there\u2019s no cointegration, it doesn\u2019t mean there is no correlation. And the cointegration only works on the time-series model \u2014 so the original S2F model. By the time the discussion was at its peak, I introduced the other model, the S2FX model, and there of course you see an even higher R2, and even higher correlation, and we cannot apply the cointegration test over there. Yeah, that was a very interesting discussion at the time!"}

How would you think about that kind of issue?"}

We actually did some tests in the S2FX model but also for the S2F model, to include other input variables next to stock to flow. For example, the number of transactions over the time, or other variables. And it clearly shows what you already said, that whatever you input into the model, the stock to flow is the main and dominant force driving the price! That\u2019s the case with both models."}

That would just be a difficult thing if you were gonna try to run that on other assets, because we can see that with Bitcoin, but if were gonna try to run those other \u2014 not the price calculation, but with other things \u2014 on gold and property, that\u2019s kind of a harder thing to do! Theoretically some of those numbers might be possible to create though, right?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [14:18]: Well there\u2019s different aspects. If you do it on other coins for example you find no correlation between stock to flow and price. You actually find cointegration and correlation with the price of those altcoins and the price of Bitcoin, but not between their own stock to flow and the price of those altcoins. If you look at gold and silver and other assets, there are not much assets with a large stock to flow! With a stock to flow larger than, say, 2. There\u2019s really not much there: silver, gold, diamonds, real estate, maybe art. Art is a $2-$3 Trillion market but I don\u2019t have the data for that! I would be very happy to analyze if somebody has the data. But that\u2019s about it I guess. For example if you look at gold, gold over the same period that we have the Bitcoin data, since 2009 \u2014 if we look at the stock to flow of gold and the market cap of gold, it sort of stays the same! It\u2019s very stable and I plotted it in some of the charts. The amount of movement in stock to flow of gold and the market price of gold is \u2014 if you plot it, it\u2019s really stable! It\u2019s remarkable!"}

And I think you\u2019ve also been Tweeting out recently just under a month ago, you were saying, RIP to the idea of lengthening cycles and diminishing returns. So why was that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [15:53]: Yeah that\u2019s one of the models that\u2019s out there, and actually it\u2019s a model I looked at before I had the S2F. It\u2019s basically the time model that a lot of guys are using, and that is I think for the first time used and published by Trolololo in 2014. It has this nice curve and it fits the price of Bitcoin very well! But it tends to be not that stable. It tends to be\u2014 you have to adjust it every year to keep it fitted to the data. So the time model is there but it\u2019s also underestimating it a little bit, and it doesn\u2019t of course give credence to the step function that you see in the Bitcoin price. And that occurs after the halving! So if you use the time model, it\u2019s the first crude indication and we\u2019ve all seen those charts, but it doesn\u2019t give any weight to the halvings and the very clear timing of price rise that you can see in the Bitcoin price that is around a year, one-and-a-half years after the halvings. It\u2019s a nice model, but it\u2019s maybe a starting point but not a robust one. And while we\u2019re at it, I think it also underestimates it a little bit, because if you look at the S2FX model, you can clearly see that last period, the last couple of years, the Bitcoin price was a little bit underperforming to that model. So the phase if you will \u2014 the last four years \u2014 was lower than the model predicted! And that might be due to COVID, the last part of that four-year period was kind of low, but if you use only that data \u2014 the time series data \u2014 to fit the curves, then it must be a little bit lower, it must track that lower data in the last couple of months! The other thing, actually the main reason why I said the lengthening cycles and the lower cycle theory is dead \u2014 if you track the prices without the model, just looking at the data, you compare it to what happened after the 2016 halving and what happened after the 2012 halving, you see that the price now is right in the middle of those two historic tracks. And the diminishing cycle return theory says that it has to be lower. It states that the next peak will be later and lower than the last \u2014 well if you look at it right now it\u2019s obviously not the case! It\u2019s a bit early to call I should say, but we\u2019re smack in the middle of the last two! So yeah, it doesn\u2019t look that way!"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "Stephan Livera: I see. Yeah. And if we compare something like the S2F and one of the Twitter bots by our friend Bitstein\u2014he\u2019s got the S2F Multiple and he\u2019s got a really interesting chart where he\u2019s basically showing the actual price versus the model price. And right now we\u2019re above the model price. It\u2019s like $36,000 versus the model price right now is around $28,000-$29,000. So what\u2019s your view on that idea? Even though we don\u2019t have cointegration and that\u2019s not part of it anymore \u2014 it\u2019s just interesting to a person looking at that chart, that you think, Okay, it\u2019s really interesting that it\u2019s staying inside that range! One critique that someone might be thinking is, Well hold on! These guys with their charting and modeling, they keep changing the day and now it\u2019s 463 days and so on! How would you think about that particular issue?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [20:09]: Yeah the 463 days is a nice thing, I\u2019ll get to that later! But first of all, the fact that the price tracks the model so well it\u2019s actually magical to see! Also for me! You make the model, you hope it will be right, but of course the proof is in the pudding, and now we see it happening. So it\u2019s really magical to see it, I\u2019m very happy about that. And we have to see whether it goes to the $100k or the $288k, but I\u2019m quite optimistic about the $288k. That would be my target! About the 463 days, that\u2019s actually an improvement that was suggested by Preston [Pysh]. Preston and I discuss the models a lot, and also that site digitalik.net, and you mentioned the Bitstein bot \u2014 it is a beautiful thing! And digitalik has also real-time charts on his website. Well Preston said \u2014 you\u2019d have to ask him himself because he can tell it much better than I! \u2014 but he said, Okay I see what you did there. You tried to keep the model as simple as possible, only to have the stock to flow as an input, but we also see from the last two halvings that the price effect kicked in later. So there was a time lag in price going up after the halving, and we can model that if just very roughly look at the last two halvings. We see that the all-time high after the 2012 halving was about 13 months after the halving, and for the 2016 halving that was about 17 months after the halving! So on average there\u2019s 15 months from the halving to the all-time high, and if you multiply that by the number of days in a month which is 30.5, you get very close to that 463 number, and that\u2019s how you calculate it! And when you use that number the fit will be even better than if you use only the stock to flow variable, because you now have adjusted the average to stock to flow over those 463 days. Yeah I think that\u2019s a very nice addition and it tracks even better!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "Stephan Livera [23:05]: Yeah I certainly think it\u2019s really interesting that when you look at this chart that it just seems to stay within these blue bands. There are times when it goes outside the dark blue bands but it\u2019s still inside the light blue bands. It\u2019s just an interesting chart to look at, but I guess at any point it depends how bullish we are on Bitcoin. Obviously all of us are, we\u2019re all bullish on Bitcoin! I wonder, because we really don\u2019t know when any of these things break down, right? And when I say break down, I mean break to the upside! It may just be that enough people around the world wake up to Bitcoin, start buying it, and then just completely destroy all the models and just completely blast through, right? And this would be more like \u2014 as I was discussing with Preston \u2014 the idea of the final cycle. So I wonder, as you look at the landscape, what\u2019s your thoughts on that idea of, Okay, are people just gonna start front-running the future cycles and just buy it all now? Are we going to a final cycle? Or, the counter-argument might be something like, Well see, there\u2019s just not that many people who are woken up to Bitcoin and putting in enough of their portfolio into buying Bitcoin! So it just can\u2019t reflect yet!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [24:27]: Yeah! Well that\u2019s a very interesting discussion! I think we\u2019ll be having that exact discussion for the next 12\u201318 months at least! It touches on a lot of interesting aspects \u2014 this final cycle discussion. And let me mention a few: one is the efficient market hpothesis, which was also one of the critiques on my model. Nic Carter wrote a nice piece about it. The efficient market hypothesis says that all the information that\u2019s publically available should be reflected in the prices of the assets. Stock to flow is publically available, the model is publically available, it should not be so easy to make money as just to buy Bitcoin now, follow the model and be rich! That model cannot be! On the other hand, and then we come to this front-run argument: if now we see that the model does work, regardless of the efficient market hypothesis, it does work and it goes to $288k, what happens then? Will people when front-run the next cycle? Because for the next cycle the model predicts a price that\u2019s far above $1 million per Bitcoin! So will investors then price that cycle in as well? And the efficient market hypothesis says that they will, because the information is out there, we\u2019ve seen that it works, and if everybody thinks that it works then it would be the rational thing to do! On the other hand, I don\u2019t know! I had that same question when the price shot up after publishing the article in 2019, but that turned out to be too early, because the price went down aftwards. But we had that exact same discussion back then! And just like back then, I think we will not have a final cycle now, and we will not see front-running \u2014 we will see some front-running, and some FOMO if you will after $288k \u2014 so the price will probably go much higher, maybe to a half-million at the all-time high, but I think the other important aspect is risk, and that was my counter-argument at the time against the efficient market hypothesis, that critique as well. And I wrote an article about that. Yes, the model is out there, yes all the information is out there and it shouldn\u2019t be as easy as it seems to be now to make money \u2014 just buy Bitcoin and follow the model and be rich \u2014 on the other hand there\u2019s perceived risks and real risks in the market. I did a poll on that! And the number one risk that people see is governments banning Bitcoin! And we see a lot of actions in that direction! We see US Treasury minister announcing draconian laws over Christmas with a process that\u2019s not very democratic, so they\u2019re really trying to kill it! And we see today, like [inaudible from inaudible 27:56] warning about regulation that has to be made against Bitcoin, although regulation of course is not a ban, well it could be good or bad, but it\u2019s a big risk! And people see it as a big risk, and governments have barely woken up to the possibility that Bitcoin could be a $1 Trillion, let alone a $10 Trillion market, so when that happens, they will move! And that could be a good thing or a bad thing, but there is a risk! And another risk is quantum computing. They could break the private public key relationship. So all the experts say it\u2019s not possible and it\u2019s not possible for at least ten years and there may be adjustments to the software, etc., but still it is a risk. And I think those risks whether true or not will surface again, especially after the FOMO phase, after we hit the stock to flow target models and maybe beyond. There will be risks, and there will be black swan events that make those risks look very real! We will go down again. So I surely think that that will happen, and also that\u2019s another argument \u2014 human nature! Greed and fear! It will stay the same. So yeah we probably will have FOMO once we go up and go beyond $100,000, and we go too high because of greed! And then some risk will surface and people will be so fearful and they\u2019ll estimate the risks too high and price will go down. I think that will stay the same. Having said that, the third discussion we\u2019ll touch \u2014 it\u2019s the topic of hyperbitcoinization! All Bitcoiners know what it is, but it basically means that Bitcoin goes to the moon. That it will become a unit of account, and that maybe the Dollar dies. And Bitcoin will be the thing that we all use to pay and to save money. Yeah, when that happens, that would be the final cycle, but it would be more of a final cycle for the dollar in my opinion than for Bitcoin! So it will be the moment that the Dollar will end, to exist as the global currency. And I don\u2019t think that will be this phase, the phase 5 if you will, but the phase after phase 5, when Bitcoin will reach a market cap of somewhere in the neighborhood of real estate \u2014 let\u2019s say $100 Trillion USD. I like that number for some reason!"}

So just looking at the OG S2F model, it seems to me that that model predicts the price for $100k for this round, and I think it\u2019s something like $300k or so for the next round in 2024-2025 cycle. And then the 2028\u20132029 halving and bull run I think it\u2019s predicting something in the millions! I mean really if we were gonna talk about final cycle I think to me it makes more sense that 2029 might be the final cycle. But things can change, but that\u2019s one way to look at it if you\u2019re looking at the S2F model."}

Hyperbitcoinization, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing to look at, but it will be very interesting. And the front-running also, I don\u2019t know! For sure if we reach even the $100,000 level, people will think, Whoa! Well it might go to a million I better buy some. Well maybe it goes down but I\u2019ll wait a couple of years! It will be really really interesting how that plays out, how that dynamic goes from here."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB: Yeah true that. The DCA\u2019ers, the retail investors of course. Maybe that\u2019s not the biggest driver at the moment. The three big buyers at the moment: Greyscale, who buys everyday more Bitcoins than are mined. Paypal \u2014 same thing. Cashapp. So those three buyers buy each along everyday more Bitcoin than there are made so they have to bid the prices from people who hold them. But as we\u2019ve seen, most of the weak hands have already been shaken out by the volatility, so the hands holding the Bitcoin right now are stronger as ever! I mean if I look at my own coins, I\u2019m not gonna sell, never! Ever! But to the next person who wants to sell, but you don\u2019t get my coins. And they will be harder to get. And it\u2019s really funny, I can see that on the on-chain data as well. The fact that there\u2019s not much coins. And I don\u2019t mean the balances on the exchanges that are Tweeted about and looked at. I mean really the on-chain data, it shows a pattern that is very consistent with the stock to flow model and the four-year cycle, and it shows a shortage that is scary actually! The price has only one way to go in my opinion."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "Stephan Livera [34:14]: Yeah for example my sponsor Unchained Capital they have some really interesting work, the HODL waves chart. Which gives you a nice indicator of waves of HODLing and how long some people have been HODLing their coins. Because there\u2019s people out there that have been HODLing for multiple cycles at this point. You make that point and it\u2019s a good point about how you add across Greyscale and Cashapp and Paypal and others \u2014 that\u2019s buying more coins each day than are issued by the miners each day. But then I guess the other part of it is old HODLers, because eventually at some price they might say, Okay I want to take some out and buy a house and buy a car, because obviously yes Bitcoin is going up but I need to live, I need to look after my family, I have living costs. Maybe that will become a more dominating factor of just how many people are willing to offload, even if it\u2019s a small portion aggregated across millions of millions of HODLers. That small portion can add up to a new amount of supply hitting the market in terms of the sale of Bitcoin."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [35:24]: Yeah I think that\u2019s a key thing that you described there. And the HODL wave chart is one that has inspired me since the very beginning to do on-chain analysis and look at the data. If the listeners don\u2019t know what we were talking about, Google it, look it up in Twitter and find that chart! The HODL waves\u2019 basis is really an intriguing way of looking at Bitcoin! I make the HODL charts myself. If you run a full node you have all the data, so if you can do a little bit of programming in Python you can make them yourselves, and you can go a lot deeper than that as well. For example the UTXO set, the total amount of coins in the transactions that are unspent out that \u2014 that changes over time, which is sort of the HODL waves in one dimension. That gives a treasure of information about how those coins move, who is selling, and it\u2019s really unique to Bitcoin as well, because in bank data you don\u2019t have that! You would have to have access to all the banks\u2019 databases. With Bitcoin for the first time you have that! It\u2019s like a heaven for quants, it\u2019s like a heaven for people who like to make new economic theories about how this works \u2014 this supply and demand game in Bitcoin."}

I know Coinmetrics do some related analysis and also Glassnode. For listeners I have an interview with Rafael Schultze-Kraft, he\u2019s from Glassnode he\u2019s the CEO. And we spoke about these statistics as well. One interesting one is looking at, of all the unspent transaction outputs, you can look at how many of them are sitting in a profit and how many of them are sitting in a loss position, and try to ascertain where the market is at from looking at those numbers. Looking more broadly at the macro world of all of this, what are some other relevant factors to think about? It seems every six months we get some drama about Tether, and, Oh my god, Tether is not backed and so on! What\u2019s your thoughts on all of that?"}

It\u2019s a lot of FUD. It\u2019s really a lot of FUD, and it\u2019s been there since I\u2019ve been in Bitcoin! For years and years I\u2019ve heard that type of FUD, and it\u2019s at specific times, when the price is sort of wobbly and there\u2019s a lot of things going on such as with regulation at the moment, and all of a sudden \u2014 I get daily about 50 DMs in my Twitter of people, How about Tether? How about Tether? They put their comments under each one of my Tweets, and my impression is that it\u2019s like an army of FUDsters that try to spin a story, and of course it gets picked up by people without a brain! So yeah it\u2019s nothing! There was a podcast I don\u2019t know where it was but it was with the two guys from Tether last week \u2014 it was very good! They explained how it works and why Tether is there, because you know the banking system is very slow. If I transfer money to the US or to Australia it could easily take three days, where if I want to park some Bitcoin money in cash and use dollars for a couple of hours, that then would not be possible. So yeah you need a coin, a synthetic dollar where you can park your money that goes way faster than the old, slow, traditional banking system. And I get it! Of course how much the Tethers are backed by real dollars and other assets \u2014 that\u2019s an important thing and more transparency can be given there by Tether, but it\u2019s a very traditional issue as well with having collateral against loans and future markets that are fully collateralized every day. I guess for people who are not aware or not familiar with those collateral processes, that it sounds very opaque and mystique, and it\u2019s just stuff that you make a lot of FUD and conspiracies about, but for me it\u2019s a non-issue."}

But I mean, what I\u2019ve been seeing since 2008\u20132009 basically since Bitcoin was developed \u2014 since the global financial crisis \u2014 the amount of quantitative easing and the amount of money being printed by central banks what they have done the last years is so overwhelming, it\u2019s the only macroeconomic topic! It overarches everything! It\u2019s staggering really how much money has been printed and what it has been used for! And I\u2019ve been in a position where I have dealt with banks on a daily basis, from bank contacts, with Basel capital management requirements, from insurance contacts, solvency requirements \u2014 we\u2019ve been selling stuff to the central banks for years and years and years, and they buy everything! You know that famous scene in The Big Short where the crew is at a conference in Las Vegas about mortgages and mortgage securities \u2014 there\u2019s also conferences like that in Europe, actually the same organizers. And at those conferences \u2014 the central banks are there as well \u2014 everybody talks about the central banks because they\u2019re the biggest buyer out there! They buy everything! They have an unlimited budget! I think if you\u2019re in the trenches and you deal with the central banks and with quantitative easing no matter how you call it \u2014 it can and has become a semantics game lately\u2014 if you\u2019re in the trenches and doing this work, you see the absolute staggering obscenity of it, if you will! It really reminds me of Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany! We\u2019ll have to see, but knowing the quantitative easing and how it works, it\u2019s very helpful in making me a big believer in Bitcoin, I truly believe that!"}

We\u2019re sort of tracking in the middle of the two other halving cycles?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/TnCU-1cbUbw", "title": "SLP243 PlanB Demand For Bitcoin Will Skyrocket", "text": "PlanB [44:14]: Yes we have the two earlier cycles, which is not much, but we can compare. That was the 2017 cycle and the 2013 cycle, and they are quite different actually! 2013 was of course very early, and it was in a stage where mining was a big topic as well, because that was the year also that ASIC chips \u2014 mining chips \u2014 application specific integrated circuits, very specific mining chips were produced and made the security of the network like a million times bigger, and everybody that had that chip had an advantage. So there was huge optimism and excitement about this next step in the Bitcoin history, and price shot up from a low of $2.5, average $5 to $100 to $1,000 within one year! So that was really unimaginably fast, without much corrections in between as well! But then 2017 the mining technology was already done, there was a lot of improvement but not that big huge jump like in 2013. So the new thing and the excitement was all about altcoins and ICOs and forks. Everyone was dreaming about tokenized world and new coins and FinTech wave hit the markets! And that craze shot the price up from $200-$400 at the low to $20,000 at the high, so that was also very nice rise, but it had several corrections in between, like six or seven! Very different from 2013. It had six or seven corrections of about 30% in between in that big rise. So right now the big question is: correction or no correction? I guess part of the answer we already have because we just had a big correction when price shot up from $10,000 to $40,000 and then crashed to $30,000, which is -25% correction. But if you ask me it\u2019s very similar and maybe more similar to 2013 price-wise than 2017! So we might as well see not that much corrections on our way up! And that is also compatible with the macro environment that we see at the moment. We talked about that \u2014 the quantitative easing has gone full throttle of course since COVID, and more money has and will be made by central banks in the months to come than we have ever seen before. That money has to go somewhere! That goes to banks, that goes to companies that are saved that would have otherwise defaulted, and all the people, all the managers and employees of those companies, they can go on buying stuff which is a good thing of course, but it also keeps the economy going and in that way in a real sense that quantitative easing money \u2014 the printed money \u2014 enters the real economy! And it enters the real economy at the top first: managers, politicians, the people that are already rich. So what did they do with it? They buy assets: a second or third house, a street of houses, as an investment objective. They buy gold, they buy Bitcoin! And part of that you can quantify in the model, but part of that money will trickle down to assets and also to Bitcoin. But with the amount of money being printed, it\u2019s almost unimaginable that we go down from here or have very big corrections. And quite honestly you can see that in the prices too! The last three months, if there was a significant dip in the price, it got scooped up immediately by buyers! And Michael Saylor was very eloquent and very open in how he did it, how he bought his first $200 million and the other $400 million and the other buys since then. He does this very professionally with a lot of help from people that have the equipment and the access to the market, and they move that money without moving the price too much, in very small tranches. [49:00] Yeah I have the feeling that every dip, every time the price goes down, there is somebody with stronger hands that will say, Thank you very much for the coins, they will now end up in my wallet and they will go in deep cold storage, never to be seen again! Or at least in the next ten years! So yeah I think we\u2019re witnessing that right now! And it feels more like 2013 than 2017."}

I\u2019ve been invited almost weekly to join meetings with hedge funds, family offices, banks, insurance companies, to talk about Bitcoin, not only the stock to flow model, but just the whole Bitcoin thing and how you can buy it and how you can hedge it and how you have to look at it as an investor. So there\u2019s really a lot of demand from investors, and one of the things that I find very interesting\u2014also for myself \u2014 is the derivatives markets. So if you look at the futures market for example, you can now buy Bitcoin for, say, $35,000, and you can sell it at the same time for a year later \u2014 you can future sell it for more, I don\u2019t know what the price is, but $36,000. So you get a certain $1,000 profit, you only have to wait for a year! And of course you give up your upside and you also have no downside so there\u2019s really less risk, but you really have to know what you\u2019re doing. But anyway, if you do it like that\u2014it\u2019s a cash and carry strategy \u2014 you can make a 20% return annualized, and that is the kind of returns that Warren Buffett and famous hedge funds get! But not banks or insurance companies \u2014 they\u2019d be happy with maybe 5%. So 20% in an easy trade like that is something that cannot be ignored and is seen by more and more people, and some people pop their toes in the water and of course it works. It is too good to be true! And after that in a negative interest rate environment that I\u2019m living in in Europe, -0.6%, you can actually borrow money for negative interest rates if you\u2019re an institutional investor. But even as a private individual you can lend against your house for 1% or lend without collateral for 3%! Well if you use that money \u2014 and I\u2019m advising not to do that, but for professional investors this is candy that is too good to be true! And then if we look at option markets, we see implied volatilities of over 100%, which means there\u2019s call premiums from 40\u201350%. So you can do volatility harvesting strategies which are very very profitable and cannot be done on other asset markets! So the whole derivatives markets and the relation between the spot markets, derivatives markets, futures, options, etc., I\u2019ll be watching them like a hawk\u2014actually participating in them! I see a lot of people entering those trades and looking at it. I think the future and option market prices will give us a lot of information about the future, so it\u2019s really interesting if the base rates of the futures stay that high, if the implied volatilities in the options markets stay that high, and yeah so that\u2019s one thing that cannot be denied anymore by the more traditional investors and that will be seen by more and more. The other thing \u2014 it\u2019s not so much investing but more society thing \u2014 it\u2019s a very positive thing: good money, sound money is very important for humanity! It\u2019s good for trade, it\u2019s good for specialization, it\u2019s good for capital allocation and allocation of scarce resources, where the investors were not. And to have sound money, a measure, a unit of account that can be counted upon, it can be depended upon, is very interesting! And very important! And we don\u2019t have that at the moment, because central banks are printing the money at will, they\u2019re using it for political purposes, they\u2019re weaponizing it, and it\u2019s like an architect that uses a measure like the meter or an inch that changes every day! Imagine how a building like that looks after the architects are finished! And that\u2019s our economy at the moment! So we\u2019re building with a measure that is changed every day, and Bitcoin will \u2014 for the first time \u2014 introduce a constant. And that is the 21 million coins. So that will for the first time ever, be a constant in finance like there is a constant in physics \u2014 the speed of light, for example. In mathematics. So that is from an Austrian perspective and I talked about this with Saifedean lately. It could be very interesting, this constant! And maybe with that comes a sort of predictability, but at least a totally different kind of economy, separation of money and state, and in my opinion it will even unleash the next Renaissance with science at the very heart of it, but also with art and freedom and a totally different society than we have at the moment that is dominated by governments and states. And this one will be more sovereign individual and math and art-based! So yeah I find that a very hopeful perspective, and that\u2019s maybe, apart from the investing, the main reason why I find Bitcoin so very very interesting!"}

And some of the earlier points you were just making there like the cash and carry strategy \u2014 now obviously for those of us who are more hardcore Bitcoiner, we wouldn\u2019t want to give up the upside of holding Bitcoin, but for somebody who\u2019s a little bit more trying to dip their toe in here, this is an easy way for that kind of person to \u2014 so long as they have the right institutional set-up to be able to achieve that kind of strategy. And I think the other point that you raised that\u2019s really interesting in terms of where the next big amount of demand or the next potential big markets of people who are gonna come into Bitcoin, is this whole cost of carry which we\u2019re seeing in Europe! People who have large amounts of fiat money in their bank accounts are now starting to get charged for that! And well, if we think from a cost of carry perspective, you can quite cheaply hold Bitcoin for a tiny tiny fraction of the cost that these people are paying to hold fiat money in a bank account, so I think that is just gonna really start driving home this cost of holding fiat. Whereas historically it was free \u2014 or you made money on it!"}

I can tell you, the moment that that happens, that negative interest rate is unleashed upon your savings, then the demand for Bitcoin will skyrocket! I saw it happening around me with friends and family, I saw it at work, I saw it in the whole country! Everybody is scrambling to get their money out of this negative interest rate bullshit!

{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [01:27]: Yeah definitely! So I graduated college in 2010, and that was my first job out of school, was selling enterprise software. And I stayed there for about 4 years before leaving and doing other things, but my time there \u2014 a couple quick points: I would say the first thing that really threw me off was that Oracle is an IT company, right? They serve enterprise customers and they give them technology. And yet the internal technology at Oracle was garbage! So some of the sales reps were using Salesforce CRM tools to manage their own pipeline, even though Oracle had all kinds of CRM tools. And then you start calling on these large businesses\u2014like one of my accounts was Verizon for a long time. And you take a look at a company that you think has their stuff together, and yet they make horrible decisions managing their IT year-over-year: everything\u2019s abandoned, it\u2019s short term, and I was sort of disenchanted by the allure of these big companies and what they were meant to do. And if I go back a second, I felt at the time that my whole life was leading up to that, and going through business school and learning these things. And all of a sudden \u2014 you know, getting the job that I thought I wanted! And it just wasn\u2019t as fulfilling as I thought! I had a good time there, I paid off my student loans there, I met great people. The stress of a sales environment \u2014 I actually performed really well under that environment. I did well there! I just had the flash in my eye of, Is this the rest of my life? Is this what I\u2019m gonna be doing? That just wasn\u2019t good enough and so I took a little detour."}

You speak about the internal architecture at Oracle. And then maybe [with] your own internal software it seems like you rearchitected your life! You kind of rebuilt it from scratch. And went on a journey with your now wife. And you went \u2014 you didn\u2019t just get out of corporate world and just run \u2014 it seems like you went and joined communities and built things!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [03:32]: Yeah that\u2019s right. What ended up happening was, I was being groomed for a promotion. I flew out to Denver to meet with a new team. And I sort of had this experience of, I don\u2019t want to become these people! It was just the classic sales reps: not polite to the server, infidelity runs rampant in the community, and just all around deeply unhappy people! And so\u2014I feel that I\u2019m susceptible to my environment as most people are, and I could just flash before my eye again realizing that I was going to become this. And so what ended up happening is I just hit pause, I went through a Yoga teacher training here in Minneapolis while staying full-time at Oracle. And I sort of had the viewpoint of: (1) my future life at Oracle as the trajectory shows, and then you have (2) this other community of people that are radically different! That process opened my eyes to, Okay, maybe I don\u2019t have to do the thing I thought I was meant to do! And it gave me the courage to try something different. And so what you\u2019re alluding to then is my wife and I quit our jobs \u2014 we met at Oracle selling software \u2014 and we quit our jobs and bought a one-way ticket to India a few months later. Then we backpacked through Asia for a year, that was in 2014. All the while there we were building a wellness business essentially teaching wellness entrepreneurs like Yoga instructors. Teaching them business skills: how to build a website, how to market themselves, things like that. Because we\u2019re business people that fell into the Yoga world, and we noticed that that community is not very good at business. We had the skills, so it was a nice match. We did that for 3 years traveling and working, and then bumped into Bitcoin in 2017. And then I realized, Okay, this is what I really want to be doing! And more or less, I put my foot on the break for the Yoga business stuff \u2014 hired a small team to run it \u2014 and then just decided, This thing\u2019s important here! I\u2019m gonna rearchitect everything on Bitcoin! If you think about it from the high level, the pendulum swung into the corporate world where I thought I was going, and then I just rebelled against it and did the complete opposite \u2014 backpacking hippie for a few years. And you know we meet sort of in the middle and there\u2019s Bitcoin! Which I think is a more wholesome synthesis of who I am! I think I\u2019m more suited for that! So yeah it\u2019s been a fun ride in Bitcoinland ever since!"}

And mushrooms I think have always been part of your life from what I\u2019ve read! I think you grew up eating steak and mushrooms. But how did mushrooms become such a lens into the universe?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem: Yeah good point! I did grow up eating mushrooms just casually, just put it on your steak. And it wasn\u2019t until I graduated college \u2014 I had started experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms, I started foraging and just looking for Morel mushrooms, which are common in the United States. And it was through foraging that really kicked it off! You\u2019re just out in the woods, you\u2019re hiking around looking for treasure. That sort of kick-started an interest here. I started learning about what these things are, found out about Paul Stamets and started learning about them. That was maybe 2011 or so, that started. Yeah I carried that with me just as a side project! [06:40] I\u2019m always studying some weird thing. And it wasn\u2019t until we were living in Bali in 2018 the first half of the year and going to lots of meetups and writing for a crypto publication online which \u2014 anyways, forget that part of the story! \u2014 and then I started putting together the Mycelium Archetype. I first heard about it through Terence McKenna, who had explored the Internet through comparing it to Mycelium as sort of this living, breathing network-like organism where individual units sort of together create this larger whole. The sum is greater than the parts! And the whole network actually displays tendencies that a living organism might do! And so I had an epiphany that night in Bali, rode my scooter home, and just sat there and wrote and wrote and wrote, and more or less got probably 80% of the first article down \u2014 at least in idea form. And 6 months later I put it into an essay and published it. So it sort of merged the two worlds! It\u2019s quite shocking that in Bitcoin you can do something like that! As someone who\u2019s into a lot of weird stuff, the synthesis of the two and how it\u2019s accepted in this community is pretty special! Whatever you bring to the table, that lens sort of taints your perspective on Bitcoin! But it\u2019s also really useful, because you have these sort of analogies to draw on previous knowledge bases that people have, and so there\u2019s little short cuts into the Bitcoin ecosystem. At least that\u2019s how I see it!"}

I thought there were a lot of interesting things going on here! One I kind of saw you leaving Oracle and that kind of life and going out and building \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like your Mycelium, you going underground, you getting distributed, you gaining knowledge, trading, growing, and then you kind of come up with Bitcoin, it seems like. Maybe that\u2019s your spore, I think that\u2019s the word! And what I find that\u2019s really interesting is that you look at Bitcoin through this mushroom lens! And what I think is really interesting about that is also the timing of it. We\u2019re in the bear market and the article gets into that! You know, Bitcoin is like Mycelium, it\u2019s kind of growing organically and trading and learning, even though you don\u2019t see anything above the ground. And then you make this interesting connection where Mycelium and maybe Bitcoin are like dark matter and neurons in the Internet. They have life! Maybe you can touch on that: how is Mycelium like those things?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [09:21]: Yeah definitely! So Mycelium is \u2014 for people who aren\u2019t necessarily initiated into the world of fungi \u2014 fungi have their own kingdom. You have animals, you have plants, you have fungi, etc. There\u2019s millions of different organisms that make up this kingdom, and the predominant form these organisms take is the Mycelial form. And you can think of this like an underground root system. It\u2019s one cell-wall thick, it\u2019s just an underground Internet \u2014 it connects all the trees and plants together, it forms communication networks, it communicates, it trades resources, it sort of acts as an immune system for the forest, and from that lens you realize that a forest is not this competitive thing. Like, yes there\u2019s competition here and there, but really it should be looked at as its own ecosystem that acts as one unit! And the Mycelium is sort of the membrane that holds it all together! And that underground network archetype just seems to show up all over the universe. So fungi have been doing this for over a billion years on our planet. They\u2019re sort of the shepherds of life on our planet. This network system just seems to be a really effective evolutionary strategy. And then you start to realize, all dark matter and dark energy takes on this same network archetype. So if you zoom way out, it\u2019s the network. If you zoom in on your neurons, our brains our the same network archetype! And so you start to see it all around! And to me what that says is: it\u2019s an evolutionary strategy that whatever we call life employs, and it happens to be a very effective strategy, because fungi are the most resilient type of species on our planet \u2014 it\u2019s not even close! They\u2019ve survived all six mass-extinction events. Where you know, the dinosaurs get wiped out \u2014 fungi inherit the earth. It happens again \u2014 fungi inherit the earth. So this network archetype just seems to be sort of the definition of antifragility! And now you look at that through a Bitcoin lens and you realize, Okay, Bitcoin is like this Mycelial network \u2014 individual people and computer nodes. We all sort of make this network, and we all act in our own rational best self-interest just like the Mycelium does. But together you form this unit that adapts to its environment! It seeks out unmet demands and sends a signal to developers to go create some new software. If a bug is in the system, information travels through the network and it rebuilds. So it learns and it adapts, and it\u2019s very hard to kill because just like Mycelium you can break it in half \u2014 just literally break the organism in half \u2014 and now you have two organisms! And so you could cleave off a section of Bitcoin and you could go confiscate all of the miners in the United States, and the network routes around that and it creates an opportunity for another part of the organism to flourish! And you can sort of go down \u2014 and I like analogies, I find them to be effective. Obviously, Bitcoin is not Mycelium. But they\u2019re useful, and some people push back, like, Speak true or speak straight! But I prefer the analogies. I think they\u2019re more fun! And now thousands of people have reached out to me in DM saying, Hey! I didn\u2019t really understand Bitcoin\u2014this analogy worked! Or, I gave it to a friend, or, I didn\u2019t really think about Bitcoin in this way. And so it seems to have struck a chord. And to be fair, I\u2019m not the first one to talk about this. Ralph Merkle has a really famous quote where he says Bitcoin is a living organism. And if you haven\u2019t seen this quote \u2014 I don\u2019t have it pulled up \u2014 but it\u2019s a very, very cool, poetic way to look at Bitcoin! So I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of giants and since then many other people have written about it. Especially Gigi\u2019s work, Proof of Life, etc. That\u2019s a fantastic series!"}

Does it have maybe an enzyme that is a casualty? The analogy I\u2019m kind of looking for \u2014 what I\u2019ve thought a lot about \u2014 is maybe the cyber hornets. Maybe they aren\u2019t making mistakes! But like Ross Ulbricht and Roger Ver \u2014 who you know were in the Bitcoin space and were acting maybe \u2014 they thought in their rational interest and maybe perpetuating or trying to grow the system? I don\u2019t know where their place would be in the analogy."}

It\u2019s like this branching, forking little finger-like tentacles that are each individually exploring their locality. And let\u2019s say one of those forking little branches of Mycelium\u2014the edge of the network \u2014 let\u2019s say it comes across a predator of some sort. Another fungus or a bacteria. It sends information through the network to the specialist. The specialist mushroom scientist creates a custom enzyme \u2014 they\u2019re the best chemists on our planet \u2014 creates a custom enzyme, and then ships it around the network. And then the network learns and grows. It has essentially a chemical library of different new molecules that it invented for its own benefit to survive, and then you apply that to humans \u2014 all of a sudden, we start taking compounds from the fungal kingdom! The majority of our medicine comes from fungi because our biology is so similar. And the medicine works for them and it just so happens to work for us. So back to the Roger Vers of the world \u2014 how I see them would be: they\u2019re just one tip of the network. And they made a decision they thought was right. Now it seems like the network decided that they were wrong \u2014 but that\u2019s the deal! There\u2019s casualties here! Underground is the most hyper-competitive part of all of our ecological systems! It\u2019s gruesome down there! And same with Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s pure competition. You screw up \u2014 you\u2019re kicked off the network. No problem! And your reputation matters, and don\u2019t gamble with it!"}

So let\u2019s compare it to vertical gene transfer. In genetics this is Mother + Father copulate and have an offspring, that offspring has the genes from the mother and father so it\u2019s a vertical transfer from one generation to the next. And horizontal gene transfer is essentially \u2014 let\u2019s say there\u2019s two fungi in one ecosystem that are competing. And one fungi says, Wow, that other guy \u2014 he\u2019s doing really well! I wonder why he\u2019s so effective in this ecosystem? So the fungi eats the other one, or consumes some amount of genetic information. It absorbs from another species that\u2019s parallel to it, and then it incorporates that DNA into the species! I\u2019m anthropomorphizing here \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the fungi are thinking when they do this. But it seems like a last ditch effort that says, Wow, my strategy\u2019s not working! I\u2019m gonna steal their strategy and hope it works! And now if you compare that to Bitcoin, the analogy I use is that, Okay, there\u2019s thousands of different cryptocurrencies now \u2014 they each make different tradeoffs, they\u2019re all trying to create features to out-compete Bitcoin \u2014 I think the answer is it\u2019s futile but they\u2019re gonna try! And let\u2019s say there\u2019s some new technology that\u2019s produced \u2014 let\u2019s say zero knowledge proofs or some sort of privacy tech. Maybe Bitcoin wants to implement that! And so the Bitcoin Mycelial organism could perform horizontal gene transfer and just adopt what that other network uses and bolt that onto Bitcoin!"}

You make these broad and excellent points relating human psychology, hype cycles, and the mushroom method. And you speak to how \u2014 again this was written during the bear market\u2014so I think it\u2019s really interesting that the mushroom goes through its own cycles. Maybe you could speak to that: how is that similar to Bitcoin cycles and our psychology and how we think about cycles?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [18:01]: Yeah definitely! I think that\u2019s a super fun analogy! So how Mycelial organisms lived is through underground \u2014 they\u2019re in that networked form. And when conditions are absolutely perfect, it concentrates its energy right below the surface of the ground, and then it produces a mushroom that shoots out of the ground. That mushroom is like the apple on an apple tree. The real organism is underground, just like the tree is the Mycelial form. However that fruiting body\u2014that mushroom\u2014that it is is a reproductive organ. It grows very quickly, and then it releases the little mushroom spores \u2014 tiny microscopic seeds that float around and they land nearby. And when they land nearby \u2014 as long as there\u2019s two of them near each other\u2014they fuse together and form a new colony. And then they live underground and they grow and grow and grow and then when conditions are right, that new organism reproduces by producing a mushroom! So that\u2019s the fungal life cycle. Now if we compare that to hype cycles in Bitcoin, most of Bitcoin\u2019s life, the price is boring! There\u2019s no hype \u2014 nobody\u2019s talking about it. That\u2019s the bear market! That\u2019s like the Mycelial form when it\u2019s just underground, networking, eating, growing \u2014 all those things. But when conditions are absolutely perfect in Bitcoin land, the price goes crazy, everybody starts talking about it, capital floods in, your taxi driver\u2019s talking about it, and just like the mushroom, out of nowhere it explodes! It very quickly matures and dies back very quickly. So that\u2019s the blow-off top. But just before it starts coming down, it recruits all these new people to the system, and those are like the little mushroom spores. And now the mushroom spores fly all around. Most of them died, but a few of those newcomers into the Bitcoin market stay! And those become the next wave\u2019s HODLers. And then the bear market \u2014 they network underground, they build resilience, that\u2019s when we\u2019re doing things like Proof of Keys, getting people to hold their own custody, learning about Bitcoin. Yeah that\u2019s sort of the bear market! It feels like the Mycelial organism is concentrating all that matter right below the surface, and it doesn\u2019t feel very long before a mushroom will pop out and the price will rise!"}

The mushroom thing is so interesting because you talk about it in the book where humanity has had this long mysterious relationship with mushrooms: fear, maybe anxiety, euphoria, medicine. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s even in video games! The red and white mushrooms in Super Mario Brothers \u2014 I never really connected these dots. You even tell us what kind of mushroom that is! And then it\u2019s like, Bitcoin conjures up a quasi-religious fervor. And we talked about it as a life form as well, and I feel both these kind of camps! How do these either inter-relate, or what does it mean that Bitcoin is like a religious fervor?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [21:01]: So the Mycelium of Money series is four parts. The first part is about Mycelium decentralization \u2014 essentially establishing that as a fungus. The second one is about the social layer. That\u2019s humans interacting with Bitcoin. And you can think of that as humans interacting with mushrooms! And I take a long time-scale to go through that one, and what I\u2019m trying to bring up is that humans have had relationships with mushrooms for as long as we can look back in time. Oftentimes that\u2019s simple food. They can be used to sharpen your knives, as medicine, to transfer embers, to get you high, they can kill you, dyes \u2014 all kinds of things! There\u2019s lots of fossil evidence of ancient man using these tools. There\u2019s one famous one: \u00d6tzi died in the Swiss Alps like 8,000 years ago. And what he had on him was a necklace with one mushroom which hardens when it dries out. It\u2019s so hard it can sharpen steel! And he had another mushroom that you can store an ember and travel long distance. You can have one ember for three to five days inside this. It\u2019s called a tinder conch. Think of a little vessel that keeps a spark alive. And if you think about ancient man, fire is everything! He was crossing the Alps in winter, and of course you need your fire! So what this tells us is that ancient man realized how important these mushrooms were, and they formed a relationship with them, and the humans that formed a relationship with mushrooms out-competed the others! [22:37] Then you fast forward and now you start to have these societies that realize that certain mushrooms get you high. And at low doses that actually increases your eyesight. And so that makes you a more effective forager if you consume low doses of psilocybin. And at higher doses it creates more of a religious-like experience, or a community-like experience. So it would be like a bonding thing for the tribe. And higher doses like I said it\u2019s a religious experience \u2014 you\u2019re taking in all kinds of new information. And so there\u2019s a theory that that\u2019s why humans evolved! To have such large brains. Because there\u2019s this unexplained period in history where our brains were small small small small small, then all of a sudden our brains exploded! And that\u2019s the neo-frontal cortex! That\u2019s responsible for language, symbolism, higher critical thinking, religious ideas. And so I tease with that idea just a little bit there, and then there\u2019s all these examples of different tribes who worship the mushroom in different ways, or have ceremonies with it or whatever. And Bitcoin\u2019s kind of the same way! It\u2019s sort of this mysterious thing that people feel like they discovered something when they find it! You want to evangelize it as soon as you get it! And so there\u2019s all kinds of parallels with the religious side. And now some people \u2014 we live in a very secular society now so a lot of people aren\u2019t really into religion\u2014that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not either! However, from the religious angle in Bitcoin, people would try to say, Oh! You\u2019re so religious! You\u2019re zealous! You\u2019re tribal! That\u2019s true, right! But they try to use that as a bad thing! If I\u2019m investing in an upstart money that is attempting to overthrow the incumbent dollar and all the power that comes with it \u2014 I want crazy religious people to defend this network, especially in the early days! It\u2019s like providing cover fire to get Bitcoin through the door. Once it gets to a certain size, it will become too big to fail, and so the religious community around it is massively massively important. Guys like Michael Saylor realize this \u2014 he coined the term the cyber hornets. [24:45] I think that\u2019s quite apt! Yeah and now here we are: a bunch of crazy people overthrowing the legacy system peacefully! And it\u2019s attracting the smartest, most interesting people on the planet to this thing \u2014 this thing that somehow represents truth in a world without it! And it gives young people purpose! It just feels like the right thing to do! And it feels like something that humanity needs! So myself and many others find it very easy to dedicate most of our waking hours to this thing. And podcasts popping up everywhere, incredible writers \u2014 the industry is just flourishing! So it\u2019s quite fun to be a part of it, I would say."}

I think I want to turn a little bit more to the Rhythms of History. But as we wrap up kind of talking about the Mycelium of Money, I see almost these two pieces as \u2014 they\u2019re very different voices to me \u2014 and I mean that as a compliment! I feel like they\u2019re written from two different people. I think there\u2019s many facets to brand it, I\u2019m just really curious \u2014 this is just like a drop in the bucket! The first book for me is a page-turner. I just gobbled it up! And you put it on your website \u2014 I love this \u2014 it\u2019s a 58-minute read. I did it in an hour and fifteen or and hour and a half. But that to me was a page-turner! And the next \u2014 and I think these should be books! But I also feel like we\u2019re making our way through a trilogy. So the first one is like\u2014in the great trilogies of the world, maybe this isn\u2019t the greatest trilogy, but Star Wars: A New Hope \u2014 and now we\u2019re moving into the the Rhythms of History: The Empire Strikes Back! And we got this greater macro front that we\u2019re dealing with. And I don\u2019t know what the third opus will be! But I really want to turn to the second one. And as we phase into that \u2014 you make a point though in the Mycelium of Money about Bitcoin getting through the great filter of crypto \u2014 and that religious fervor will help it survive. And I see that. But I\u2019m almost like, Screw crypto! This is what\u2019s gonna help us get through the great filter of humanity. So we have this birth of Bitcoin, but now we got this larger context that we\u2019re all dealing with in these turnings. And to kind of speak on that, you put on the website, the turnings was a 50-minute read. I did it in about six hours over two days. I read like three paragraphs and then I had to go for a walk and think about things! We talk about how we go through time, and time is maybe not completely circular, maybe not completely linear. I\u2019ve heard [??? 27:43] say it\u2019s more like a spear, continuing through time but there\u2019s a circular nature to it. But what are these turnings that we\u2019re dealing with? And let\u2019s start from really wide out: what is a 90-year period of turning?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [28:01]: Yeah! So just to comment quick on the great filter. This is just a fantastic framing I think, both for Bitcoin and \u2014 I like what you mention with regards to humanity\u2019s point here \u2014 it might be humanity\u2019s point. If someone\u2019s not aware of what this is, it\u2019s essentially asking the question of, If there\u2019s so many galaxies and so many planets around the world, why don\u2019t we see life around us? Why isn\u2019t there spaceships, why hasn\u2019t anyone visited us, why haven\u2019t we seen any evidence? And the thesis is that, as life develops, there becomes these crucibles, these really hard challenges, and most species die out when they hit these challenges. It sort of filters out these species. So maybe there was a million humanoid-like species around the world, but they can\u2019t ever figure out how to get off their own rock, and so they eventually bomb themselves off with nukes. So that could be a great filter! Or maybe the great filter happened behind us! Maybe it was from single-cell to multi-cell organisms! Maybe that is really hard to do! And so there\u2019s single-cell organisms everywhere, but very few make it past that! We don\u2019t know! But it\u2019s nice to think about. Now if we think about Bitcoin, I call the great filter of cryptocurriences the nation state. Many people call it the final boss. My framing there was, if your cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t feasibly stand a chance at surviving a state-level attack, then there\u2019s absolutely no point to continue. Because they\u2019ll let you get big, and up until the point where it matters, and then they\u2019ll squash you! And 99.999% of cryptocurrencies will not pass this filter. I think Bitcoin is the only one that I feel confident that it will! [29:47] Yeah I don\u2019t think anything else will at this point! Now let\u2019s transition to the Fourth Turning. For context this is a book written in 1996 by two demographers \u2014 they spent like 30 or 50 years studying demography, and they realized, Why! There\u2019s all these patterns! And why are all these patterns coming up? They put this into a series of books. The Fourth Turning is one of those books. It\u2019s like the Cliff Notes of their book called Generations, which is like an encyclopedia of history and trying to find patterns. Most people think of time as a linear process. From a worse past to a better future. And that\u2019s sort of the culture today. You mention from the Jewish tradition they view it as a spiral? It goes upward over time? That makes sense. That\u2019s actually a really good point: lots of ancient cultures had observed cycles of history! And the main one he measured was called the Saeculum, which is a long human life which happens to be between 80\u201390 years. And for whatever reason every 80\u201390 years we go through a crisis period\u2014this is typically war! So 80\u201390 years ago we have World War II, before that we had the Civil War, before that we had the Revolutionary War. And so, Why does society have this crisis every 90 years? You dig in deeper and all of a sudden you realize that there are very clearly defined stages! In a 90 year period there are four stages, or four turnings. You can think of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. And they\u2019re really a mood, and that mood would allow you to predict how society would respond to a catalyst. The mood helps you observe it from that way. And why are these moods created and why are they so observable? Because humans \u2014 just the way we emerge through culture and society \u2014 we have this repeating pattern of four different archetypes: the hero, the prophet, the nomad, the artist. And what happens is, based on the mood at the time when you\u2019re born, that will imprint you as a young person. So everyone in the milennial generation, we grew up during the unraveling, and now we\u2019re all sort of the same. Then when we grow up, now as this well-defined generation, we start to act based on our upbringing in predictable ways, and we start to imprint history! And then the next generation, they\u2019re dealing with all the crap that we put on them, and then they do the same thing! I\u2019ll pause there for a second to say that the thesis comes off as something that shouldn\u2019t be true. Many smart people bump into and they go, Ah! That kind of sounds like a stretch! I hear lots of counter-examples in my head! I can\u2019t even believe this! And what I would say to those people is that the book itself adds a lot of color. This thesis needs a ton of examples before it really clicks. And I try to summarize it in the essay, but if you are interested and you want to go deeper, I think the book will help solidify these. And now I see this runs pretty much everywhere! I can\u2019t help but observe through this! So it does seem fundamentally human. To bring us to present time, we\u2019re right in the middle of the fourth turning, which is the crisis period! That\u2019s essentially the realization that our institutions are crap! This is our politics, this is our healthcare, our governments, this is everything external to the individual \u2014 all the institutions are garbage! And then we all of a sudden realize, Wow! We really do need these institutions! What is healthcare was good? What is politics was good? So people had this collective realization that they want to re-do it and they want to have good institutions again! And you can look at that as supply and demand of order. A high supply of order means our institutions are doing well. A low supply of order means that our institutions are bad! So we have a low supply of order now, but as you enter the fourth turning, the demand for order is accelerating. It\u2019s rising very quickly! So that causes a frenzy, so any little spark in a fourth turning will be a really big deal, because we\u2019re all primed to make that change. We\u2019re in the middle of a fourth turning now, we have probably about ten years left. It started in the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, and I predict it to end around 2030. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve hit the climax yet so I expect some turbulence here, and then I expect massive changes to politics, to healthcare, to money \u2014 everything\u2019s gonna change! And the analogue is 1929\u20131945. So that was the previous fourth turning. It started with a financial crisis in the stock market, the Great Depression, FDR\u2019s New Deal. Now we get into World War II and then we have Bretton Woods towards the end of World War II. All kinds of things changed: U.N., NATO, World Bank, IMF, social security, pensions \u2014 all kinds of crazy stuff was built there, and it was very unprecedented at the time! Now we take these things for granted, but at the time it was very radical! FDR ran off a campaign of fiscally sound budget! He was gonna balance the budget. And then a few years later he\u2019s passing the largest stimulus bill in history, and going full Keynesian and doing all kinds of crazy stuff! And the business people at the time \u2014 the government\u2019s in desperation \u2014 so they\u2019re reaching for money wherever they can get it. And the business people at the time are going, Okay, we either print a lot of money, or they\u2019re gonna start taking money from the people who have it! So all the business people are like, Yeah, fine! Devalue the currency! No problem! And of course we know that devaluing the currency hurts the little guy more than the people with assets. And that started deficit spending during a crisis. And now we\u2019re deficit spending for fun! Everyone gets some points !\u2014 if you\u2019re Stephanie Kelton."}

What are these macro forces that have molded them. But I also want to think a little bit about how does one maybe not be a part of this? What is the prophet, the nomad, the hero, and the artist?

It sort of feels like, if this is true, then our future\u2019s already written \u2014 so what\u2019s the point? Right? That\u2019s sort of the thing that comes up. But the reality is, this is a very general approach. This is how society moves. You can think of it like, let\u2019s say there\u2019s twenty variables in how you measure society. How do we approach politics? How do we raise our kids? What is the supply and demand of order? Are we individualistic or communistic? Each one of these are on a pendulum that just swings over time. And the mood just determines \u2014 it gives you a rough angle: are we increasing in demand for order, or decreasing? Right? So it\u2019s very broad! You can\u2019t avoid it at the society level, but at the individual level you can break every single one of these rules no problem! And many people do! But it\u2019s really just how that group-think occurs."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [37:45]: Yeah it\u2019s interesting. So as a millennial myself I\u2019m a \u201chero\u201d generation. Heroes grow up in the unraveling which is deregulation, everybody\u2019s getting drunk at the party, nobody\u2019s trying to end the party, this is the 90\u2019s, this is the early 2000\u2019s, the gettin\u2019s good! Nobody really cares, nobody is asking questions \u2014 it\u2019s fine, right? So millennials actually grow up over-parented, and the reason is because the previous generation \u2014 Gen X \u2014 they were under-parented, so a whole country in America hated kids because they were the black sheep kids\u2014they didn\u2019t have supervision, so they were bad boys! And so millennials are a response to that, saying, Wow! We gotta fix the kids! So millennials are super-overparented, you can\u2019t hurt \u2018em, we\u2019re bubble boys, thirteenth-place ribbons, we\u2019re all special, so we grow up with that, and then we also come of age during the crisis. This is the period where we rearrange the exterior world, we go to war, or we do something big enough to change everything. That\u2019s sort of the millennial generation: that\u2019s the hero. The risk with the millennial generation is that they\u2019re too orderly, they\u2019re too collectivist. So we\u2019re gonna flirt with socialism \u2014 we already are! And the millennials like that, they choose that! They unironically call each other comrade, which obviously if you pick up a history book you might realize how stupid that is. But they don\u2019t! And they actually prefer to over-index towards collectivism rather than individualism. And I feel \u2014 myself \u2014 I do not fit in with this model at all! I\u2019ve always been individual, go against the grain, do my own thing. However I see my peers very much like this! So that\u2019s sort of the thing here: I might break the mold, but my friends haven\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s pretty obvious. So that\u2019s one generation\u2014let\u2019s go through a few more to actually get to your point. [39:44] The next generation is the prophet archetype. The prophet archetype is the baby boomers. These are the people who grew up, they were born after World War II. Everything was given to them after World War II \u2014 this was Pax Americana, white picket fences, the gettin\u2019s good, suburbs, equality is high, and then these little spoiled kids who got everything, they grow up and they realize that the culture was sterile, it\u2019s boring, there\u2019s no edge, the music sucks, nobody\u2019s doing anything spiritual, and so that prophet archetype comes of age and they cause an awakening. This is a rearranging of the interior world. And that\u2019s halfway through the cycle! So at the midway point we rearrange the interior world \u2014 at the end of the cycle in the fourth turning we rearrange the exterior world. And the prophet is responsible for that interior revolution. This is the psychedelic 60\u2019s, Civil Rights movement. Before this this would be the Puritans, and any religious movements \u2014 they happen at that period! They grow up, they\u2019re principled, they\u2019re narcissistic, they\u2019re ideological. They\u2019re all hippies, right? Then that ended, they had a wake-up call, and then they became yuppies. And they were the individuals. They didn\u2019t actually want to grow up \u2014 they were the ones who raised Gex X\u2019ers without any supervision. That brings us to Gex X. They\u2019re the nomads, they\u2019re practical, they\u2019re like, Just tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it! They\u2019re usually the ones who have to make the hard decisions, they\u2019re the bad boys, they\u2019re pragmatic, and throughout history they were never the key leaders. They were always the strong general who actually won the war. They put their head down, they did the things nobody wanted to do and they got it done. Versus the prophet \u2014 baby boomers \u2014 are more like sit in the tower and talk about how we see eye-to-eye or we don\u2019t. The Gen X\u2019ers don\u2019t actually do that much to culture compared to the prophet and the hero\u2014the millennials and the boomers. [41:52] And the reason is obviously that the prophets create the interior revolution, the heroes create the exterior revolution. And the nomads are just sort of part of the process and they bridge the gap. They don\u2019t actually cause too much changes in the world. Then the heroes, the millennials, and then you have the youngest generation now, this is Gen Z. This is the artist! They\u2019re caring, they\u2019re indecisive, and artists grow up during a crisis. So they\u2019re growing up right now. The previous artists were the silent generation. They grew up during the Great Depression, and they didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. They were conservative, they were silent, just in the background. And the young people today they\u2019re growing up during the crisis so they\u2019ve become sort of withdrawn and sensitive and they\u2019re conservative with their values. They don\u2019t want to risk anything because it\u2019s pretty risky out there! And the Gen Z are gonna grow and be the empathetic mid-lifers, they\u2019re great grandparents \u2014 fantastic grandparents! Yeah they don\u2019t really mold the world that much, but they prevent the Millennials from going overboard, because if the Millennials go overboard, the heroes go overboard, we have this very orderly, rigid society! Nazi Germany would be an over-indexing of the hero generation: we\u2019re all on the same team, you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us, strong central planning, no problem if we get rid of our liberties because this is good for everyone. And so they\u2019re willing to make that sacrifice! The artist is a little bit different. They don\u2019t want to be under a strong rule like that! So that\u2019s the four, and interesting throughout history, they just go in that order: prophet, nomad, hero, artist. And each one influences the next, and the constellation \u2014 so is a hero old or young? Is an artist old or young? What stage of life are they at? That constellation of the archetypes is how you know what mood we\u2019re in. Yeah that\u2019s a long-winded answer!"}

My children and everyone\u2019s kids growing up during this crisis, this fourth turning \u2014 at the peak of it maybe \u2014 you know if it was a financial crisis I feel like I could just sweep that under the rug and not really affect that. This COVID crisis is a little more in their face. I read what you wrote about that generation and it rings true! But I don\u2019t want my kids to necessarily be meek or just standing off to the side. Maybe with great advice but not really taking action! The other thing \u2014 your background is in writing, communications, and it seems like there\u2019s a lot of references to Hollywood. When we talk about Gen X I think about Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. That kind of archetype. And I wonder too, what if we got a strong individual as a president? Can that change these moments? Or is the president a reflection of the moment? And I\u2019m not trying to get political. Can strong individuals disrupt these generational turnings? And I\u2019ll go one step further: like Satoshi. We start going through the hard times, the good times \u2014 whatever the quote is \u2014 and a lot of people say we\u2019re in the soft times, but I\u2019m like, But I don\u2019t know, Satoshi\u2019s like the hardest dude out there! Hardest thing out there: man, woman, or group, that put this together and is gonna take us further, maybe into a fifth turning! You get to this later in the article. But can strong people interrupt these things?"}

However they\u2019re not all like that! You have a massive influence on your kids! But you just know the gravity wants to pull your kids that way. And if you know that you can sort of steer around it. Also with the artist, they become adults in the first turning, which historically that\u2019s a time of peace, high equality \u2014 things are really good! And so they\u2019re gonna hit their 20\u2019s post-crisis, and they\u2019re gonna be potentially in a much better world! So each generation sort of has their trade-offs, and they get the crisis out of the way early! The boomers, they\u2019re all trying to retire right now and they\u2019re gonna find out pretty quickly that they don\u2019t have as much retirement money as they thought they did! So each generation has its own struggles. [46:28] Regarding the strong man, the president. That\u2019s an interesting point! In the fourth turning, we have a strong demand for order, and what that usually manifests as is a very strong president! This is the archetypal big man with a stick. He\u2019s the alpha male, when times are tough, the biggest, strongest guy gets to make the decisions and everyone falls in line. It\u2019s very human! In a sense Trump does display this: he has bravado he\u2019s loud, he\u2019s a bulldog, and so many people say, You know it\u2019s not working! We want a strong president who will just make decisive bold actions! Another thing, interestingly, is during all fourth turnings, what ends up happening is there\u2019s a great champion who leads us out of the dark night! And a great champion is usually an older person who\u2019s in a leadership position \u2014 usually a president in the US \u2014 and they do the hard things and they rally the troops, and they have incredible support from the populace to vote for them! And that person is the one who makes the hard decisions. What I don\u2019t know is, I don\u2019t think Trump was our great champion. I don\u2019t think Biden will be our great champion. So maybe our next president is the one that actually takes us out of this. And if that\u2019s true, we might have a dark period here for four years, because we want our great champion as soon as possible, because that\u2019s when the mood shifts and we go, Okay we\u2019re rallying around this, we\u2019re gonna make it happen with this guy! And that\u2019s when the change occurs, because you need to get everyone on the same page in order to make these massive changes! And historically war is the only thing that motivates people to make huge changes."}

I do have a question around that. The anatomy of the fourth turning, so where we\u2019re at now. You wrote, Welcome to winter, a time of fire and ice. The supply of social order is still falling, but the demand for order is steadily rising. Although not required, fourth turnings historically end with total war. This was one of those moments where I put the book down and I went for a long walk. This was the sixth or seventh walk! You talk about how COVID is the thing that will bring us together to get us through the turning, and you question whether it\u2019s a strong enough moment of unison. It doesn\u2019t seem to unify. And you say war is usually that thing, but maybe war is not gonna happen here now and I think I agree because countries are turning inward. They\u2019re no longer pillaging outwardly. But I do think it\u2019s war-like turning inward on their own. My latest thought is that the country that does the best job at feasting inward will then take that superpower outward. Via cyberwar, psychological warfare, information and misinformation warfare. I don\u2019t want to get too dark, but like, where do you think we\u2019re going over the next few years or really ten years, before we get out of this?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [49:43]: Yeah I am pretty concerned to be honest! I think just looking, if you zoom way out, the trend is toward totalitarianism, and right now every nation state is playing this game. It\u2019s not like we can point to the Axis of Evil or the rise of Nazi Germany as the \u201cbad guys\u201d. Right now every single nation is grasping for as much power as possible, almost as if they can\u2019t help themselves, and so it is pretty concerning. I\u2019ll get to what I think is gonna happen, but before that let\u2019s do a morphology of a crisis. What are the stages in each 22-year fourth turning period. So all fourth turnings start with a catalyst. And this is a defining moment, it\u2019s very clearly a before and an after moment, and this would be the \u201808/\u201909 financial crisis. After the dot-com leading up to \u201908, not much had changed all through the 90\u2019s up to \u201908, and then all of a sudden, everything changed in \u201808! This is Occupy Wall Street, you see Obama runs on Hope and Change. Prior to that it\u2019s like, Let\u2019s keep doing what we\u2019re doing! After \u201908 it\u2019s like, We gotta make a change! So that was the catalyst. Then there\u2019s a regeneracy period, and that\u2019s realizing that, Okay, times have changed. Now there\u2019s a new force, a counter-entropy that gets people involved and active. This is things like Bernie Sanders, the rise of Democratic Socialism, Social Justice Warriors, this whole new counter-culture to the previous culture. This is mostly led by the populist Left that\u2019s leading the culture of the day. They define the rules of engagement from a culture standpoint, and I would say that around 2012 we were firmly in that! Then the next point is the climax. This is the big one. This is bombs being dropped on Pearl Harbor, this is Paul Revere shots heard around the world, rallying the troops, this is the Civil War, etc. Typically \u2014 in March I thought the climax was going to be COVID. I thought it was going to be this big thing, it sucks, everyone rallies together and we get through it and that marks the climax. But now like you already alluded to I think it\u2019s just ripping us apart. It\u2019s become this hyper-politicized thing. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on there! It just feels like a power grab at this point. So I think it\u2019s just gonna be fuel that leads to a larger crisis. Typical in fourth turning, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s one thing and everything\u2019s normal. One small crisis leads to another crisis which leads to another crisis until the whole thing topples over. So I see COVID as the starting point for ramping up towards the real climax, and after the climax there\u2019s a resolution period where the scores have been set, we rearrange all the pieces, and we start on a new path. But how is this gonna play out? I think there\u2019s four things: (1) it could be COVID. I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big enough. (2) We could have total war, but it seems like no one is in the mood for total war. However maybe in the next five years we have these new central bank digital currencies, China is trying to assert their dominance, maybe China oversteps their bounds and the US and China get into a little tango. That\u2019s possible. (3) It could also be a black swan event, something unpredictable. Terrorism, some sort of weird hack that causes something to happen. (4) Or it could be civil war. And sadly I think this is the most likely! There\u2019s a lot of stats that back this up, things like 50% of people said that they think that violence is justified in order to get your political war passed. 26% of people said that they\u2019re willing to have their state peacefully secede from the United States. So there\u2019s all these little metrics: the divide between the cities and the rural people, individualists versus collectivists. There\u2019s all these tension points. They\u2019re getting worse, they\u2019re not getting better. The politicians are actually using this to their own advantage! Then you combine it with the media \u2014 everything\u2019s feeding on this division! And what\u2019s scary is that all it takes is one little spark and you could see some really really nasty stuff around our country. Now it will not be a North vs. South clearly defined thing. It will be this confusing quagmire of you don\u2019t know who\u2019s who, you have the separatists over there and the group over there and weird flag this and that, martial law, transportation\u2019s bad, food\u2019s disrupted. Just a general feeling of unsettledness, and various people will be freedom fighters and whatever that looks like. Weird militias coming around. That\u2019s what I sadly think is the most likely \u2014 I hope we don\u2019t reach that! You mention Bitcoin as the fifth turning. And so I do think there\u2019s a chance here! Bitcoin is unique. It sort of serves as an institution. And what we need now are strong institutions. So what if Bitcoin was this thing that we could architect around? It\u2019s fair, it sort of appeases the Millennials because it\u2019s fair \u2014 it\u2019s not twelve old white guys running the money. It is a network, it\u2019s a community. So theoretically that could be the thing! What it does uniquely is \u2014 we\u2019re also in a bad economic situation as well as all this social unrest. So Bitcoin is sort of this life raft. You can get on the life raft instead of sinking on the Titanic. And the quicker we get people on this life raft, the fewer people are gonna be desperate and flailing and backed against a corner which is when people become violent. Rational people don\u2019t become violent but if push comes to shove, normal rational people do become violent! I think Bitcoin both at the individual level \u2014 because you don\u2019t have to go down with the ship financially \u2014 and at the society level, whether that\u2019s a corporation protecting their person in power, whether that\u2019s Iran getting around sanctions and monetizing their energy assets in order to pay for imports in Bitcoin because the US doesn\u2019t let them play in the financial system, or another nation that might just wanna not be under a Dollar hegemony. Or their country\u2019s going bad and they have nothing to lose and they just YOLO into Bitcoin! I think all of these things just reduce the amount of suffering, and reduce the amount of people getting desperate. And so I\u2019m optimistic that Bitcoin could actually be the institution we need right now!"}

Bitcoin as an institution makes me think of Nick Szabo\u2019s piece on social scalability. I thought that that was fascinating! Let\u2019s look at social media, though. I\u2019m curious if you think social media is a force for good or not? And let\u2019s start with the notion that\u2019s stipulated that social media decentralizes information and news and communications and that\u2019s been a force for good. I think that\u2019s kind of clear to a certain extent. I mean there\u2019s some negative externalities. But let\u2019s look at this question through maybe like the 2024 presidential election, and I\u2019ll frame it like this: social media I think will eventually get compromised, not that the three networks ABC, NBC, CBS were compromised, but that they were centralized. You\u2019ve got one narrative the country was feasting on one thing, one water cooler conversation. Social media is that now, but you\u2019re really talking about two algorithms. Let\u2019s look at 2024 and what if the election was like Jack Dorsey versus Mark Zuckerberg?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [57:31]: That could totally happen! It seems like we\u2019re in a situation where the most popular person wins. I think Trump sort of expanded the Overton window, meaning, what\u2019s the conversation that we\u2019re comfortable having? People think we have this choice, we can choose \u2014 anyone can become president! Not really! There\u2019s this extremely narrow band between the Left and the Right, and that\u2019s who we\u2019re actually voting on. But Trump is this external figure that didn\u2019t really fit into the band, and he showed that it was possible to strong-arm your way in without playing by the traditional rules. So I think going forward \u2014 Joe Biden is obviously a president of the 90's \u2014 he doesn\u2019t represent anything new or forward-leaning, or of this new paradigm. But I think 2024 like you mentioned \u2014 Dorsey versus Zuckerberg \u2014 I think that type of thing is possible! The tech companies are becoming more powerful than most countries. They\u2019re now starting to play the game with the big boys! They want to launch Libra \u2014 they kind of got put in their place with that. But they\u2019re getting old now. They\u2019re getting powerful. So I think that\u2019s very real. You mentioned the \u201calgorithm\u201d, and I think we\u2019re gonna see a lot more algorithms running our lives \u2014 they already do! But it\u2019s gonna get way more sophisticated! Especially when you see these central bank digital currencies being released. What that does is it gives \u2014 well the Fed and the government already are merging \u2014 so central banks and states are the same from now on. We\u2019re just accepting that. And what they\u2019re gonna do is give us all central bank digital currencies \u2014 our phone is our money. Maybe they\u2019ll try to put chips in us, hopefully not! What it does is it gives them granular control over individuals in the economy. They can say, You have too much money on the sideline, I\u2019m gonna give you 10% negative interest rates until you put that money to work, then they can give your kid as student maybe 5% interest to encourage savings. And so that just is too much power for the state, and the central banking class loves it! They think that they\u2019re the smartest guys in the room and they think that they can manage the economy from the ivory tower. When in reality the economy is a complex beast that no one can manage! So Bitcoin is sort of saying, We don\u2019t want humans to politicize the money \u2014 we know where that gets us! It works for a short period of time then it gets corrupted, and we suffer. So Bitcoin is trying to be the thousand-year institution. The non-politicized monetary base which we can then architect around. I have no clue what 2024 will bring! What I would say is: forget everything you thought. Don\u2019t look backwards! Anything is on the table looking forward! So in this period of high volatility I think it\u2019s smart for individuals to really do some assessment on your own life: where are your vulnerabilities, minimize your downside risk, essentially make yourself and your family antifragile, so that in the worst case scenario you\u2019re protected! That could be things like owning a second passport, owning Bitcoin, having a second job, not be over-leveraged with debt \u2014 all these different things. Minimize your downside risk and just plan ahead. It\u2019s too hard to say, but it will be volatile, and I think increasingly so for at least five years!"}

I think best case scenario for 2024 and the battle the country really wants to have is Andrew Yang versus Cynthia Loomis! I think that would be stellar! In terms of the Civil War, if you compare the American project to maybe a network\u2014like you have the Bitcoin network \u2014is the American project or the American network important? And would a Civil War \u2014 a hard fork \u2014 be a positive thing for the American project and the world?"}

I would say that the American experiment is founded on principles that were way ahead of their time, and very clearly the best strategy for organizing at the time. What I don\u2019t know is, do we need these epically strong central states anymore? And I\u2019m gonna draw on the Sovereign Individual thesis a little bit here, which is that, for the Industrial Revolution period, whoever had the biggest army was the leader of the world. Previously this was the Navy \u2014 like the sun never sets on the British Empire because they had the strongest Navy. Then it became America\u2019s world after World War II. We\u2019ve gotten nukes and aircraft carriers guarding the oceans. Essentially what was rewarded was the state which had the largest capacity for violence! However, in the Information Age, which we\u2019re obviously in now, the whole logic of violence shifted! Now a big state\u2019s actually not that important, because having a big state is very expensive to maintain. Instead the defense \u2014 or the little guy \u2014 has the advantage in the Information Age. And that\u2019s through things like cryptography and Bitcoin! These are asymmetric technologies that benefit defense versus offense. And so in that world, I see \u2014 bringing it back to America \u2014 I see the fracture of America actually as a long-term positive thing! I would like to see smaller states with more control. How are you gonna govern Chicago and Western Illinois? They have nothing in common! And so why would the state do that? Maybe you should fracture it a little bit more! Why would D.C. make the same law that applies to cowboys in Wyoming and people who live in Silicon Valley? They don\u2019t have anything in common! And so I think we should fracture governance into the smallest unit possible. Now I don\u2019t know how practically a secession would go or a fracturing of the US \u2014 historically they\u2019ve been very violent! [1:03:25] You know, Catalonia tried to break away from Greater Spain. That was met with pretty aggressive response from the central government in Spain. So I don\u2019t know how it will work out. In the long run it\u2019s better, but nobody wants to give up their land!"}

So people can gird themselves before we can move to some more optimistic topics. Obviously protect your wealth with Bitcoin, minimize your debt, live below your means, have multiple sources of income, flag theory \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have a show with Katie Ananina coming out \u2014 so get that second passport, go where you\u2019re treated best, maybe set your business up somewhere else, go have your recreation somewhere else, spend money where it\u2019s cheap, don\u2019t be cancelable, don\u2019t invest in politics du jour, be self-reliant, become technical, become super-literate, do things for yourself, don\u2019t trust, verify, find a community, build your citadel you get into and stay vigilant! But let\u2019s turn to more optimism like, we get through this by hook or crook: what are we looking at in 2030? Is it a Renaissance? Is Bitcoin the biggest part of that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/bX9xZ3MaqUo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #19 \u2014 Brandon Quittem: The Bitcoin Mycologist on the Fourth Turning", "text": "Brandon Quittem [1:04:55]: So it\u2019s really hard to say from our vantage point. We\u2019re approaching the peak here. And historically in fourth turnings it can resolve in a really positive way or it can just be a tragedy. And I don\u2019t think that story\u2019s been written yet. However I am optimistic because we have Bitcoin! And if we didn\u2019t have Bitcoin I would be extremely pessimistic right now! All trending forces are a centralization of power, and we\u2019re all farmed by our fiat overlords. That\u2019s the trend. And as a personal freedom advocate \u2014 I put that freedom as among the highest ideals \u2014 that\u2019s pretty scary! But thankfully we do have Bitcoin and Bitcoin is uncompromising! The state cannot do anything to Bitcoin. They can try but it will backfire! And so I believe that\u2019s sort of a moral force for society. It puts restraint on these overreaching governments \u2014 it takes a little power away and forces them not to misbehave, because Bitcoiners can leave with the capital and no one can stop people. You can go get another passport. There\u2019s gonna be a tremendous amount of innovation coming out of Bitcoin! And if you shun the innovation, you\u2019re hurting your own country. And if you accept innovation, you\u2019re gonna go into a brighter future! So what I would say is: I\u2019m very bullish on Bitcoiners. I think it\u2019s the best group of people on the planet right now, [it\u2019s] the force that we want to back , the horse we want to ride through the fourth turning as well, and if Bitcoin continues its path \u2014 like this year I think things have accelerated \u2014 if it continues like it does now, I think Bitcoin has a real shot at turning the world around! We\u2019re gonna go through a dark time no matter what, but the next period, the next journey \u2014 if Bitcoin\u2019s a part of this which is seems like it will be \u2014 I think we do have a chance for a Renaissance! You get the money sorted and you give people a chance to be more productive, and just that foundational element of fixing the money will have all kinds of downstream effects to improve our planet. From unlocking intellectual capital from people who are locked out of the financial system \u2014 they can save their money in Bitcoin \u2014 from removing all the time theft from inflation, so normal people can actually save their money in an asset that preserves the fruits of their labor. Capital preservation is what creates society! And right now we\u2019re doing the opposite: we\u2019re hot potatoing our money as quickly as possible! We\u2019re buying just-in-time plastic junk that lasts two weeks then we throw it away. So I think Bitcoin is the thing that we need right now in society. It\u2019s perfect timing for that pendulum to swing the other way. So if that occurs, yeah we could call the next cycle the Bitcoin Renaissance, which is a phrase that Brady says in Bitcoin, also a co-worker of mine at Swan, likes to mention. And I think that\u2019s very true! Now what I don\u2019t know is, will it happen fast, or are we talking a couple of generations until we see this Renaissance? And that\u2019s really hard for me to predict! Again time is not linear! No matter what we predict now will be wrong! And in ten years we\u2019ll look back and the world will be very different. Again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s predictable, but keep fighting for Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing I can think of that keeps me sane during the process \u2014 like Nic Carter said, you\u2019re building the cathedral one brick at a time, and we might not even be alive by the time it\u2019s complete! That pursuit \u2014 something greater than ourselves \u2014 that\u2019s a force that\u2019s needed right now! It gives me purpose! It gives many other people purpose. There\u2019s nothing to do besides brick by brick!"}

There\u2019s lots of ways mushrooms can help. They\u2019re good for your yard, healing the environment, cleaning up pollution, NASA\u2019s experimenting with Mycelium to grow moon bases. You can train the Mycelium to create the shape you want, and Mycelium can actually block radiation! So I see a merging with space travel. Mycelium is gonna really be useful for colonizing Mars \u2014 probably start with the moon. That\u2019s a couple ideas! Now at the personal level, this can be through supplements to improve your health. Mushrooms are \u2014 the molecules in them are considered adaptogens \u2014 you can think of it like it gives your body whatever it needs! If you\u2019re too stressed it will help with that. If you have too much inflammation it will help with that. If you have not enough inflammation it will help with that. It helps your body find homeostasis, equilibrium in the body. They\u2019re great for your immune system, your sleep, your mind, your body, so I would recommend everyone should be taking a mushroom multivitamin. Just a broad spectrum capsule of mushrooms that is fine, it\u2019s not too expensive. And it really helps your body deal with stress and stay healthy. Most people claim these are miracle drugs. I tend to be in that camp! However the science is just catching up. In general, studying health is hard so you\u2019re not gonna find the hardest hitting science on mushrooms yet. But certain compounds like Lion\u2019s Mane has been shown to improve dementia and Alzheimers \u2014 very clearly, massive results there. Other ones help with cancer, physical fitness, etc. And then there\u2019s another whole compound of mushrooms\u2014the psychedelic mushrooms. They contain a compound called psilocybin which is very similar to one of our neurotransmitters, seratonin, which regulates mood and several different things in our day to day life. The psilocybin mushrooms are very interesting because they\u2019re great tools for healing and introspection and exploration. I feel very strongly about these compounds because it benefited me in my personal life and thousands of other people. And they\u2019re starting to become legalized in the US. And so what we\u2019re gonna see is psilocybin therapy centers just like you go to see therapist or you go on a retreat or in previous times you\u2019d go on a religious quest or go see the temple or whatever. These things are gonna pop up and they\u2019re gonna be like nature retreats that also involve eating some psilocybin mushrooms! I\u2019m really optimistic about that \u2014 the world needs this type of healing. Also people are microdosing these things as sort of a mood enhancer or creativity booster. That\u2019s also very effective. But they are illegal. They\u2019re not for everyone \u2014 treat these things with respect. Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer! Do your own research! Don\u2019t trust, verify! All those things apply here! But they\u2019re very important right now. They\u2019re also criminally understudied! So if you\u2019re a budding young person and you\u2019re curious about this stuff, go into mycology! There\u2019s twenty Nobel prizes in mycology yet to be unlocked! It will help us in all of our future challenges and tons that we have right now, so that\u2019s gonna be a big one!"}

I\u2019m optimistic that some Bitcoiners will get on there! Another podcast outside of Bitcoin that\u2019s really nice is the Santa Fe Institute podcast called Complexity. It\u2019s about complexity theory and complex systems, it blurs science with data with studying complex systems. And Bitcoin is a complex system! My favorite episodes are the ones that blur biology and ecology with economics. You blur these things with how human civilizations grow and what scaling principles can we take from all human civilizations? That one\u2019s pretty mind bending! I\u2019m just dipping my toes in so I\u2019m no expert there. That\u2019s two. I like Hidden Forces as well, with Demetri Kofinas. I don\u2019t like all his episodes, but I think it\u2019s a great one. I\u2019ve learned a lot from that podcast. My throwaway would be Rogan because I\u2019ve been listening to it for ten years!

Trying to figure out how deep the rabbit hole goes, because in my background\u2014since I have a lot of background in doing things like integrated circuits and building technology at that level\u2014I have a sort of grasp over how little control we have over what happens at certain lower layers of technology.

Okay, open source means it\u2019s more secure and we can trust it more! And yet I think you were basically dispelling that notion saying, Well actually, there\u2019s a lot of things we don\u2019t necessarily \u2014 that doesn\u2019t go all the way! Why is that?"}

Nicolas Dorier as guest host)", "text": "Bunnie [05:18]: So open source is a necessarily but not sufficient condition for trust. The problem at the end of the day: imagine you can get the source code for your browser and you can compile it. And even if you can compile it, do you really know what\u2019s going on on the inside? You really don\u2019t! Because there\u2019s just like so many millions of lines of code on the inside and all it takes is one bad line of code to create an .EXE that could cause people to steal your private keys, right? And so the other half of trust is it can\u2019t be something so complicated that\u2019s intractable for you to audit or to understand at the end of the day. [05:51] So trustability almost becomes a property of a system that you have to design in from the top. When you talk about trustability from this absolute, self-sovereign standpoint, this trust from the standpoint of like, Oh this is an Apple iPhone \u2014 I trust it because of a brand! Right? But I don\u2019t \u2014 that in and of itself is more of like a faith, it\u2019s not a fact-based trust. It\u2019s based upon social opinions and repercussions if they violate the trust. Oh, it\u2019s against their corporate interest currently to violate the trust, whatever it is \u2014 because of the branding and whatnot. But that\u2019s not a brass tacks, physics-based trust. When I\u2019m talking about trust from this standpoint, If you want to stay and have an evidence based thread based on things that you can measure with your own two eyes and own two hands and convince yourself on from the bottom-up, a system has to be designed to be simple enough to facilitate that within a humanly-reasonable amount of time! To say that you\u2019re gonna spend 5 years auditing your browser\u2019s source code is not feasible because 5 years from now you\u2019re gonna have patches that are gonna be absolutely essential for you to be secure anyways, and for you to audit those patches will take another 7 months or whatever it is . So you have this eternal cycle of patches you have to keep looking at and you never get any work done, and also you never really catch up with the current status quo. And that\u2019s one of the problems with having an open source system that is too complicated. It\u2019s not physically possible to get to a point where you can trust everything inside of it!"}

On my side I got this kind of experience as well in the banking industry for custody, where it doesn\u2019t matter where at the level the thing is secure. Basically at the end of the day, they trust their label. Like some piece of equipment that they have been using for 20 years and has never failed them. It\u2019s kind of the trust inside the label that consumers have, but I think that you have big audiences that don\u2019t trust the label \u2014 one of them of course is the Bitcoiners! But I think another type that are mentioned actually is whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or the like that really wish for this kind of device, right?"}

And so in a way at a sociological level, trusting on labels is a thing that we almost have to do, because we don\u2019t have enough time in the day to look at absolutely everything in our life! This is a little bit tangential, but another thing I worry about is my food! How do I know there isn\u2019t heavy metal on the inside or some pesticide or something that can make me sick on the inside? You can worry yourself sick worrying about these types of things and never eat, but at some point I just have to trust that this restaurant is gonna serve me good food! And maybe the argument is that the chef eats the food too! At the very least they\u2019ll be as sick as I will be, and they have a self-interest in it, right? That\u2019s more of a sociological-type trust. There\u2019s a point where it\u2019s appropriate and you have to fall back on it, but I feel like on the technology front, we\u2019ve just surrendered so much to just black boxes with no explanation on the inside! And the other key point is that the trust system can come unravelled so quickly with a single backdoor patch. It\u2019s just castles built upon sand right now!"}

So in the Bitcoin world we have a saying, \u201cDon\u2019t Trust, Verify,\u201d but as you say, there\u2019s only so much that\u2019s practical for the average person, the normal person out there. And maybe you\u2019ll get someone who\u2019s a little bit more enthusiastic and they\u2019re willing to go through things. And in the software world, that\u2019s things like compiling the software or doing GPG verify to check that the signature matches and doing some level of what we might call Web of Trust or social networks and saying, Oh okay! Nicolas Dorier is a well-known guy and he signed off on this thing and I know these other guys signed off there! But I think the interesting point is that it\u2019s not so easy to do with hardware, right?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/b4RHeGUDThM", "title": "SLP241 Bunnie \u2014 Precursor: Open Source Hardware \u2014 (Feat. Nicolas Dorier as guest host)", "text": "Bunnie [09:44]: Yeah there\u2019s a couple of levels of issues in hardware. One is obviously, do you even trust the base design itself? Like, does this piece of hardware \u2014 the manufacturer that makes it \u2014 are they reliable? Does it have the features they say it does? Does it not have extra features they didn\u2019t tell you about? These are sort of the issues you have. And then you have the specific instance of the hardware that you\u2019re working with. And this is a key point of difference between software and hardware. In software, you have cryptographic tools to transfer trust. We can hash things and we can sign them and we can verify them very quickly at the point of view. So if Nicolas goes ahead and signs off on a package and says, I\u2019ve looked at the source code and this is good and you can use it \u2014 you can reproduce his efforts by hashing it in a way and checking the signature and you can say, Well at least I know that I have exactly that piece of code that he signed off on and I\u2019m using that. When it comes to hardware, you can\u2019t do that! There\u2019s no hash function for hardware. There\u2019s no easy way for you to snap a finger and say, this is exactly the Bitcoin wallet that the manufacturer intended me to have! You know, what if someone put a small chip on the inside to record your keystrokes? What if there\u2019s a little exfiltration device on the inside to exfiltrate your keys or whatever it is? These types of things do happen\u2014they sound a little crazy, but I mean there was recently some presentations at this year\u2019s CCC where they showed some, again, live implants in the wild, like just people finding them inside of their [secure?] phones and whatnot. They do happen! And that\u2019s also a level of thing to worry about, particularly when you start talking about things like Bitcoin which have inherent value in and of itself."}

It was very well said! And basically your goal seemed to [be to] move the verification of hardware at the place of use. So how far do you feel you are from this ideal with the Precursor and also with the Betrusted environment that you are working on right now?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/b4RHeGUDThM", "title": "SLP241 Bunnie \u2014 Precursor: Open Source Hardware \u2014 (Feat. Nicolas Dorier as guest host)", "text": "Bunnie [11:47]: Right. So what Nicolas is referring to is that, in the security world we have this phrase called the Time of Check versus Time of Use problem. So if you go ahead and check that your browser was okay on the server, and then you went ahead and downloaded and someone man-in-the-middled your download and you didn\u2019t check it again \u2014 that\u2019s called a Time of Check versus a Time of Use. It was okay in the server but the Time of Use is actually after you download it\u2014someone can go ahead and modify it before you use it. And so in software there\u2019s a well known principle: you always try to check it right before you use it, the exact copy you\u2019re gonna run is the thing that you\u2019ve hashed and checked against the signature! Not some other copy in the cloud or on your disk. [12:21] In hardware, similar concept: there\u2019s a Place of Check versus a Place of Use. So one of the more laughable suggestions I\u2019ve seen is that people talk about like, Oh these sovereign fabs! Let\u2019s build a foundry on our country\u2019s soil, and that will help solve this problem of trust in supply chain! It\u2019s laudable on a number of fronts, but I think it\u2019s more of a political stunt to try and create local jobs. Which is fine, you can do that! But the reason why it doesn\u2019t help the Place of Check, Place of Use problem is that it\u2019s been established that a common vector for exploits is the couriers who deliver the package, or\u2014if you\u2019re buying off of a distribution site like Amazon \u2014 the customers who buy it tamper with it and then return it back! So people can buy like a hard drive, remove the tamper evidence seals, modify the firmware, implant something inside, and then restore the seals, and then send it back to Amazon. And then the distributor\u2019s like, Okay! Well they returned the product! All the seals are in place! We\u2019ll just resell this to someone else! You can\u2019t target who it goes to, but the fact of the matter is you\u2019re starting to put these devices out which have these implants on the inside. [13:22] And these are vectors that are completely close to the end-user. There\u2019s nothing about where the chips are made or where the factories are located or whatever it is! So you do all of this effort to create billions of dollars to spend on a sovereign fab, and at the end of the day the Place of Check is not the Place of Use. You still have this big disconnect in terms of a very trivial exploit path. And when I say trivial I mean also part of the problem is if you think about the incentives involved, you\u2019re trying to ship maybe say a Bitcoin wallet and you want to secure $1 Million of Bitcoin on it, and the person delivering it to you \u2014 how much are they being paid? What\u2019s their stake in guaranteeing the integrity of that packet? That person \u2014 what\u2019s their vulnerability to a bribe or to being distracted? The stakeholders don\u2019t have aligned interests in terms of getting you the level of integrity of the hardware that you\u2019re expecting to secure your secrets with. And so this becomes the existential problem that Precursor is trying to deal with. I haven\u2019t mentioned in detail what Precursor is yet on the podcast! For listeners who don\u2019t know, Precursor is an open hardware development platform for secure applications. And it\u2019s goal is to address these issues we\u2019re talking about so far in this podcast. You can go to precursor.dev, that\u2019s a website and it\u2019ll bounce you to our current crowdfunding site where we just closed a round of crowdfunding for it. And we plan on shipping the product in the late part of this year, 2021. And the idea is to explore the primitives and the necessary tools that we need to close this Time of Check to Time of Use gap. One of the cool parts about Precursor is that we use what\u2019s called a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as the computing element, which means that instead of trusting a third-party to create your CPU\u2014which has your instructions, which has your encodings, which has all the debug backdoors, all this sort of stuff \u2014 normally we just trust ARM or Intel or someone like this to just create this CPU and we just take it as a black box! Crazy that we take it as a black box, but we all do! We don\u2019t know what hidden instructions are on the inside of it, right? Instead of that, you\u2019re given the source code description of a RISC-V CPU, and you can compile it yourself into the gates on the FPGA and then load it onto the device yourself, if you want to be able to get to that level of trust. It takes a little more effort than using the stuff right out of the box, but the point is that you can do it\u2014you are empowered to do it. And then people say, Well, but of course, what if the FPGA itself has a piece of closed source silicon? You know, it\u2019s turtles all the way down! This is true. It\u2019s true that there are still attack surfaces on everything \u2014 you can\u2019t seal all the doors. But, we\u2019ve really moved the goal posts forward! Because in the case of just getting a closed source CPU blob, someone could put a whole hidden instruction on the inside that just sort of socks away some bytes of memory into a small register somewhere inside the chip, and it\u2019d be very hard to discover this! You know, you could put a lock on it so you can\u2019t fuzz it out, but it can only be activated with certain instruction sequences \u2014 whatever it is. And it doesn\u2019t take a lot of gates to do that sort of thing, right? With the source code at least with our device, you can look at it and see [that] none of these things exist! [16:18] The instructions decoders are decoding only the instructions we say they are! No more, no less! And they\u2019re doing it properly! And then once you compile it down to the gates on the FPGA, the compilation process itself is a little bit random. We can\u2019t predict where the critical bits will land inside of this several hundred-thousand gate device. And because of that unpredictability, it makes it very difficult for someone a priori to implant something that will pull out that one critical bit. So now, any implant that tries to pull out or replicate what would be a trivial attack on a closed source piece of silicon, now becomes a very large \u2014 you\u2019re almost like implanting every bit of your RAM, you could imagine, as opposed to just looking at a single word bank at a well known location \u2014 now we\u2019re talking about orders of magnitude [greater] difficulty in terms of executing implants and detectability on fundamental parts such as the CPU, and the structure and the integrity of it."}

And so what you\u2019re saying is, this is taking us one step closer to that vision of: the end-user is able to more clearly detect if there\u2019s something different about the device because \u2014 as I understand you, I might get this part wrong\u2014but the memory allocation is more random and therefore that just necessitates a bigger change to the physical device?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/b4RHeGUDThM", "title": "SLP241 Bunnie \u2014 Precursor: Open Source Hardware \u2014 (Feat. Nicolas Dorier as guest host)", "text": "Bunnie: [17:52]: Yeah! I\u2019m covering a lot of ground in a short period of time here! Let\u2019s tease apart two aspects of the design: (1) is the physical device itself and (2) is what\u2019s inside the actual chips. So let\u2019s start with the physical device itself, and so this is actually a little bit of a side jog from when we were talking about Intel and AMD. So first you have to trust the physical device itself is correct before we talk about anything else. Precursor is made to facilitate that type of inspection \u2014 it\u2019s very simply constructed: a single-sided circuit board. We give you reference images of it so you don\u2019t have to be technical to understand where you\u2019re going: you just have to visually do a diff between the two things to see if anything\u2019s different on the inside. And it\u2019s simply constructed, so it\u2019s not like you need crazy amounts of microscopes or whatever it is to do that type of thing. But that only gets you as far as a very gross, physical, like, What is this extra little black blob here with wires on it? Is that supposed to be on there? No! Okay, so that must be an implant on the microphone or something like this. That\u2019s the kind of thing you can tell at that level. Now, when you get to the CPU level, that happens all inside those little black blobs of epoxy! [19:02] And in order to inspect those, you would have to have a desktop-sized microscope that costs several million dollars. It\u2019s not practical for end-users to do that. And so our answer to that is that we then turn the CPU into almost basically a software description of a CPU. So all of those tricks we talked about in terms of signing and hashing and so forth, we could have a third-party auditor look at our CPU code \u2014 the description of our architecture, our equivalent description of an Intel or ARM CPU\u2014we give it to you at a level so that someone like Nicolas could look at [it]. He could sign off and say, This is good! You can take that code and confirm the integrity all the way to the point of your house. And then you can compile that code yourself into the gates of one of these black boxes. Now we\u2019re all admitting that we can\u2019t know what\u2019s inside the black box, but\u2014 where the key trick happens is that\u2014 inside the black box, when we give you our gates, it\u2019s a generic sea of gates! There are 30,000\u201340,000 LUTs on the inside, and we don\u2019t know what does what! They\u2019re all just generic \u2014 they do simple operations like Adds and Subtracts \u2014 a little bit simpler than that, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s at that level. And then we have a program that maps our description of the CPU to those LUTs (look-up tables) on the inside. And that mapping is pseudo-random. Basically you can\u2019t \u2014 very small changes in the source \u2014 we basically put a random seed on the inside, is the trick that we use. And it foils people\u2019s attempt to take that generic sea of gates and bias it away, that would allow someone to exploit the code that we put on the inside. That\u2019s the basic argument. So we basically take the hard, gnarly hardware problem of knowing what\u2019s inside of our CPU \u2014 we turn it into a software problem \u2014 and we put it into a generic sea of gates which has a mapping property that makes it difficult for someone, in advance, to predict where your exact implementation will go. And that\u2019s where the security property comes from. [21:04] If you [run] the numbers, it becomes cryptographically secure at the complexity levels that we\u2019re talking about."}

Nicolas Dorier as guest host)", "text": "Bunnie [24:07]: That\u2019s a really good question! So now there\u2019s a third or fourth dimension of security which is tamper-resistance. Up until this point we were talking about, Have we taken the red pill yet? Basically \u2014 are we in reality? If someone gives you a piece of hardware that\u2019s been tampered with, you\u2019re sort of in the Matrix! You can\u2019t break out of it \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do! That\u2019s the existential question that Precursor has been trying to answer is like, Are we living in the real world, or has someone put us in a cage and we don\u2019t even realize it? The second aspect is, once you know you\u2019re in the real world, how do you know that you\u2019re continuing to live in that world, and that someone hasn\u2019t tampered with it, and also, can you basically leave your wallet somewhere, walk away, and know that \u2014 even if someone stole it \u2014 your secrets are safe? That\u2019s the tamper-resistance aspect. I can go into this for days! This is a huge subject of research in the silicon industry. But as a general principle: if you talk to anyone who has practiced extraction of secrets from silicon \u2014 who has pulled out keys from silicon, and I\u2019ve done this, and some of my colleagues have done this \u2014 our general opinion is that even the super-ultra-secure tamper-resistant guys, they\u2019ll hold up maybe like a day or two against a well-equipped lab. There\u2019s just no amount of \u2014 and if you get into the circles and you start talking [with] the guys about the unpublished work, you would just \u2014 your jaw would drop! The most powerful technique recently is this technique called Backside Imaging. So it used to be that you had to attack from the topside-down and you had to [strip] the wires \u2014 it was actually a very difficult attack! Now actually a lot of chips these days, they thin them down before they put them in the device to make the devices thinner. The chips are so thin that you can actually see the parasitic photons that the transistors emanate coming out of the backside of the chip! So the chip, as mounted, if you just look at it with a very sensitive camera \u2014 and this is cryogenically cooled stuff so it\u2019s not like everyday sorts of stuff \u2014 you can actually see the patterns of bits firing real-time without doing anything! You just turn it on and you can see the side-channel coming out of them! And because of this, even the most secure chips with all of these \u2014 they talk about secure meshes on top and PUFs (physically unclonable function)\u2014you can just turn them on! They\u2019re just emitting\u2014out the backside \u2014 all their secrets! Right? You just have to have a good enough device [that] depacks it well enough to see it. So this is where we\u2019re at today! [These are the] tamper-resistance issues that we have today! From that respect, I have an article that I wrote that\u2019s part of my Precursor campaign that\u2019s a deep dive into this. When you realize how bad [this] situation is, the problem is that we\u2019ve had such a long-running streak of untruth in advertising in this, people don\u2019t even know how scared they should be of what\u2019s on it! [26:36] So just the goal I have with Precursor is to be brutally honest as to what we can and cannot do. So I took my own design \u2014 another one of my lives: I\u2019ve done things like extract the security keys from the original XBOX, I\u2019ve done a lot of security work in the past \u2014 I took my best crack at my own design, and of course I found a problem! This is not a surprise, and it turns out that the strength of Precursor from a tamper-resistance standpoint is as strong as the epoxy that you can put on it. Basically, if you can break off the epoxy and the metal shield\u2014and you\u2019re a skilled attacker \u2014 you can extract the keys with enough time. A couple hours. But at this point you\u2019ll definitely know that someone has attacked it \u2014 you would see the evidence of the attack. It does take some time. But I would say that\u2019s roughly equivalent to about the security of a lot of devices offered. And honestly people say, Oh, my smartphone is so secure! A lot of them have just \u2014 plug-in a USB cable, run the software \u2014 it\u2019s jailbroken. So that\u2019s a zero-touch break. [27:33] There\u2019s no evidence of any sort of tampering with that type of break issue. So at least [the Precursor] doesn\u2019t have any issues that are that bad, but yeah if someone physically took your device and they had a specially designed CNC mill to remove the epoxy from it, they could read out the keys. And to react to that I introduced a self-destruct mechanism inside the device. If you are very paranoid, you can program what are called Volatile Keys \u2014 they\u2019re RAM-backed. Unfortunately, it really doesn\u2019t fit the use-case of archival storage of high-value secrets like Bitcoin, because the problem is that if you forget to charge your battery, you lose everything in the wallet! It\u2019s not the right solution for that, but for example if you have a device and it\u2019s to communicate with friends and you want to keep it very secure and if it gets into the wrong hands you want to make sure all the comms are wiped \u2014 that\u2019s actually perfect because the moment the battery is not charged anymore, all the keys are gone, and everything on the device is unreadable. So that gives you a bounded sort of risk on very volatile, high-value secrets, but the problem in Bitcoin of storing long-term non-volatile secrets \u2014 so like your wallet keys, that type of thing \u2014 it\u2019s a very hard problem!"}

So basically Precursor itself came from a project that was originally called Betrusted. And the genesis of it was I actually did a research paper with Ed Snowden on the Introspection Engine, which was an attempt to convert an iPhone into a trustable device by monitoring its radios and saying, Okay well if the radio is not behaving in the way that I expect then the iPhone\u2019s been compromised and therefore you should burn it, break it, or throw it away. The outcome of that paper was that the iPhone was just too complex! There\u2019s too many false signals coming out that we couldn\u2019t create a reliable fool-proof trigger that wouldn\u2019t eventually make you just ignore all [the] alarms. The vendor itself would \u2014 you know, the iPhone would turn on even in Airplane Mode to do scans of the environment! We don\u2019t know why \u2014 apparently it\u2019s vendor-sanctioned behavior! Apple doesn\u2019t comment on it, but that\u2019s just how it is, right? So when you have this situation where vendors are doing things that are already sketchy and you can\u2019t \u2014 how are you supposed to find malware in that situation, right? So I thought about that for a long time and I was like, Look, we really need to solve the problem! And this is where I started arriving at the principles of simplicity, openness \u2014 these types of things. This is kind of the genesis of a lot of these principles was that effort. And so the direct target of that has always been supporting activists, journalists \u2014 people who are working in dangerous situations who need very high levels of security and they\u2019re up against state-level actors who have very little penalty for killing the person in question, and a lot of motivation to do it! We\u2019re talking about high-stakes poker here, right? [30:25] Which is why the Precursor design is so incredibly paranoid! And the goal was to make a product called Betrusted and we want it to be just out-of-the-box simple. Safe defaults \u2014 you didn\u2019t have to be a tech wizard to use it. Basically, if you had one of these devices [and] you could do a basic amount of inspection on it, you knew you were okay! Precursor came about because we got the hardware of that finished, but the software for it is still a long way off! Software, it turns out, is very hard, it\u2019s very complicated, and that\u2019s where all the bugs start to come in. That\u2019s where all the scary, unknowable complexities start to happen! And writing really good software that\u2019s simple, auditable, and understandable takes a very long time! And so we made the decision that there\u2019s other people in other communities who may benefit from a piece of hardware that\u2018s designed to this level of security and paranoia. For example, people who just want to manage passwords. People want authenticator tokens they can trust\u2014true second-factors. People want Bitcoin wallets. These types of things are applications that could probably use the same hardware platform that we\u2019ve created. And so we branded it Precursor to make it very clear that it is a predecessor\u2014it\u2019s a harbringer of other things. It\u2019s something that you add your code to [in order] to become that application. And that\u2019s why we bill it as an open source hardware development platform. It\u2019s not a product in and of itself! And the idea is: put it out there and maybe other communities will find things\u2014this is part of the reason why I\u2019m on your podcast! To let your people know about this possibility and maybe get interest and see what things I didn\u2019t expect could be useful to run on a platform like Precursor!"}

But there problem is [that] they still have the CPU problem that I described to you in that, like, We don\u2019t know what goes in \u2014 I think that they\u2019re ARM-based CPUs from vendors that don\u2019t share the source code of the CPU. So there\u2019s a layer there that they can\u2019t get into in terms of trust and reliability. And also they aren\u2019t on the reduced attack surface train \u2014 they\u2019re not about the simplified trust-inspectability. They\u2019re more looking to replace your full-featured smart phone with a device that has a better trustability aspect to it. But you still have the complexity problem in the devices. And that\u2019s a deliberate choice [that] users should be allowed to make! Like, I don\u2019t think that you can live your life practically in this complicated technological world with a device that is so simple that you could inspect it! There\u2019s just sort of like this Faustian choice that we have to make as humans: we don\u2019t have enough time in our lifetimes to learn all of technology, but we need to learn enough to be able to secure ourselves! So the dichotomy I\u2019m sort of approaching\u2014at least personally \u2014 what I do is, there\u2019s a certain set of things that I do on devices that I don\u2019t know if they have something on the inside! But it also doesn\u2019t matter! Like, why not? Browsers are convenient, Intel computers are cheap, let\u2019s go ahead and use these things and do day-to-day things that don\u2019t matter. But then the things that I really do care about \u2014 the things that are risky and high-value, I then put into this [other] device that I trust. That\u2019s the dichotomy that I\u2019m trying to move towards. So you actually would imagine a Librem or a PinePhone would work hand-in-hand with a Precursor device. You would actually carry both of them. One of them for your daily browser, and the other one for your security keys."}

But I saw that you plan as well to have a custom-made file system for the Precursor with plausible deniability. And actually that\u2019s a very familiar concept for Bitcoiners because with Bitcoiners, one thing they are doing to protect themselves from extraction of secrets directly from the device \u2014 is that they choose a password on top of it. So to get the private key you need basically what is written in the device plus this password, and the password is never stored. But the nice thing as well is that in our protocol, if you put a different password you get a different wallet, so that\u2019s how we use plausible deniability. If I understand you, you are doing it at the OS level, right?"}

Absolutely. So to clarify, we also would fully intend that you would have password unlocks. We don\u2019t rely fully on the device\u2019s security for anything at the end of the day. So yes the secondary passwords are important, and yes, we also intend to implement a tree of passwords if you will. So that the secrets will unravel over time. And I said the software\u2019s really hard !\u2014 you know, plausible deniability is a very hard problem, and we are actually going all the way down to the file system level and re-implementing the file system to that even an attacker who has the ability to read your raw disk image out constantly could not tell that there were certain secrets on the inside. We make the free space of your disk look exactly like erased files. And so if you forget your password, you literally have deleted the file. It\u2019s literally the same operation. The operating system, to delete a file will\u2014if you request to do one \u2014 all it will do is just re-encrypt it to a random key and then delete the key. That\u2019s what it does, right? The other trick that we plan to do is that, instead of every file being like\u2014normally [when] you\u2019re managing a file it has a certain size, you open it, you scan through the file to position, you read it\u2014that\u2019s the story, like the positive extraction for a file. Our files are actually databases on the inside! So once you refer to them, you open them, they have keys and you can sort of query them for the contents. What this allows us to do is that as you type in more passwords to your system, we can actually merge in secure overlays. So your contact book\u2014when you type in your initial password \u2014 will just have your everyday contacts: your Mom, your girlfriend, whatever it is, things that everyone knows that you have, right? And then, if you type in another password, it actually can \u2014 across all your files, all your applications, add an overlay to it of that particular password-linked contacts. That\u2019s the goal! And so now in addition to that, you don\u2019t have to reload your applications or whatever it is, it\u2019s just [that] you now see a new set of chat history and new things just appear. When you clear that password \u2014 they go away. And you can have multiple passwords set. And so the idea is that at some point in time, if someone says, I force you to show me these passwords. You have to unlock your device for you to enter this country, and show me everything! You enter your passwords that you remember at the time, and you hand it to them, and that\u2019s it! They can\u2019t say that there are more passwords or not more passwords, they could do a low-level disk scan \u2014 they won\u2019t find any evidence that there\u2019s files that are not decrypted or there\u2019s things that aren\u2019t being accessed, because that\u2019s what the free space looks like! All the free space looks like a file that you might have forgotten the password to. That\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re trying to structure the operating system, but it\u2019s really hard! Like this is actually a very hard cryptographic problem, and it\u2019s going to take a long time for us to write it."}

He\u2019s been writing all of the core OS stuff, and we have a couple other contributors who are working on the graphics and rendering side of things. We\u2019re hoping to get more of the community to start contributing to the software. But yeah it takes time! I mean this is just a full admission that this is hard to do and it takes time, which is why Precursor is a thing and Betrusted is not!"}

So Precursor in and of itself, we actually have a software emulator for it online, if you go to our repo and you look for https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core the operating system itself is written to run in what\u2019s called Hosted Mode, so you can either do it in a full hardware emulator or you can do it with half of it based in a UI rendering running on your machine. It\u2019s really primitive \u2014 all we have is message passing going on right now inside of it. But we\u2019re trying to facilitate some in that area early on. But you don\u2019t even have to use Xous, our operating system. At its core it\u2019s a RISC-V CPU, and you could port it to almost any other platform that you want! And I imagine more practically speaking, the early Bitcoin people probably don\u2019t want to wait for us to implement all of these fancy plausible deniability features and all of our fancy multi-lingual method inputs. Like we\u2019re putting a lot of effort in before we even get to the application level! In which case, I fully expect someone is just gonna port some RTOS to it or Linux or whatever it is and you\u2019re off to the races! It\u2019s like any other platform. The problem is that when you port one of those RTOSs to it, you\u2019re exposed to all of the vulnerabilities in those real-time operating systems! The trust level \u2014 they\u2019re pretty good actually! I mean honestly, they\u2019re probably okay, but we\u2019re writing everything for our system in Rust, so we get better guarantees on memory safety and whatnot. A lot of RTOSs are in C, so if you have buffer overruns\u2014good luck! There\u2019s these types of security properties that you have to deal with. Honestly if you want to port an RTOS, one I\u2019m very familiar with is called ChibiOS \u2014 you could probably do it in a couple, three days, if you\u2019re an experienced OS porter. And you could have enough functionality to build a Bitcoin wallet pretty simply on top of it! So I kind of expect that\u2019s what\u2019s gotta happen before we get to our level of security on our software side."}

The good news is that for the audio path, the entire audio path is in the trusted domain. Whereas, if we were to add a video camera, we would have to add a fairly complicated chip that we don\u2019t know anything about, that would have to process the video and whatnot. That being said, I did design the system so that a hacker could extend it maybe to put a camera on the inside. One of the thoughts I had is it would be nice to get QR codes if you want. They\u2019re convenient, they\u2019re fast, they\u2019re easy to use. Again, from the standpoint of just purity of the hardware, I didn\u2019t want to cross that boundary until we saw it. But the acoustic samples\u2014it\u2019s just an AD/DA converter. It\u2019s just a dumb analog to digital converter codec chip that we have, and then all the DSP happens inside the CPU. The good news is that we have \u2014 from a different, unrelated project \u2014 our team actually has a lot of experience with acoustic data modulation. For the pandemic, we were contracted to come up with some proposals for acoustic beacons for contact tracing for privacy conscious people. And so we created ultrasonic data transfer methods for getting bits of cryptographic data back and forth between two tokens at a range of one meter or so. You don\u2019t hear it, but the data can be transferred over that distance. And so we have that code base! And that\u2019s a thing that works over free space. We have to deal with all the background noise, and everything like this! If you plug it into a cable between your computer \u2014 and I would recommend doing that anyways, because why would you want to broadcast your Bitcoin transaction anyways over free space! Put it over a wire anyways! Even though a wire\u2019s a wire. But it should work quite well in terms of the data rates and the modulation."}

There\u2019s actually a certification process. You can actually register your design with the OSHA and get an actual certification number for your design as being compliant to those standards. But basically it involves releasing the schmatics and the circuit board design in a format that is one that\u2019s also editable, but one that\u2019s also readable. It\u2019s a little bit tricky in the hardware world because there are still a lot of proprietary design tools still in use. And that\u2019s just the reality of it. There is just not enough investment in the hardware realm to have a full open source stack all the way down to the chips. It\u2019s just not there yet. They\u2019re working on it!

You can generate the Bill of Materials but the Bill of Materials can be just in text form so like other people can easily review it.

But like you said, Precursor is kind of like a developer board, so what will happen I guess from when you would ship it, is that people will build their own customized Precursor by changing some part of the hardware or like whatever [they\u2019re] doing. But by doing that basically it\u2019s a more collaborative approach. It\u2019s not like they develop everything on their side and then ship it at the end and then never touch it again. I think it will be more in need of collaboration between hardware developers. Also, having a way to compare different designs like, Oh, how [is] my Precursor that I modified with my own stuff different from the original one? I understand that you have already this kind of tool that when you are finished building you can present it in a proper way, but you also need this back and forth collaboration!"}

The collaborative aspect of hardware is still a work in progress. There\u2019s a number of services currently trying to create like the GitHub for hardware \u2014 that type of thing. There\u2019s a lot of challenges actually to really making hardware extremely collaborative, and a lot of it boils down to the exact same problem that we were talking about earlier of the whole, What is this individual unit in your hand mean relative to the reference design? A classic problem in hardware is that even my design files \u2014 the ones that I create \u2014 are not synchronized with what goes into the assembly machine on the factory floor! And the reason is that the manufacturer themselves will oftentimes modify it to improve the manufacturability of the design. So very simple example is if I\u2019m trying to cut a piece of metal, and I specify a square edge on it \u2014 the cutting bit is round! You can\u2019t get a perfect square corner on that cut. So the manufacturer will make a modification \u2014 either they will add an extra drill point, or they\u2019ll actually round out the corner, whatever it is \u2014 you don\u2019t get exactly what was in your CAD file. And so what happens is I actually have to go through, send it to the manufacturer, they have to go through their drill bench and then feed back to me what the standard radiuses are\u2014this whole process, and then taking all that back. If someone wants to truly reproduce an exact copy of that design, it\u2019s actually quite hard! There\u2019s these very small subtleties! And it\u2019s like, you don\u2019t have this problem in the software world, because one you compile something, that\u2019s it!"}

Like it actually comes down to literally the details of the CNC machine that\u2019s working on that metal case that impart almost a sort of texture onto the case itself. And so these are some of the unique challenges in the hardware world in terms of collaboration. So that\u2019s one sort of extreme example. So you can just imagine now, when you\u2019re at that level of\u2014one hardware guy just patches on some blue wires on something and makes a new version! How do you capture that on the schematic? You know, those flying wires. How do you annotate that? Literal patches need to be communicated. So there\u2019s a lot of challenges there! But, in principle, and what I really do hope is that someone does take Precursor and someone in the Bitcoin community is like, Oh we really need this camera and we\u2019re totally okay with the attack surface of the camera, which is completely fine \u2014 you can add it in and make your own version with a camera! I actually designed it so that it\u2019s relatively trivial. Like you could almost take the base unit: 99% of the design is the same, and you just have to modify a couple components to mount a camera in there, write some software, and then you have a very different function device! So the hardware itself, Precursor itself, is modularly designed to facilitate this sort of community growth. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna evolve! I can\u2019t predict what people will do, what they like, what they don\u2019t like. But oftentimes what happens is it starts with a need. Someone has an itch that they have to scratch \u2014 I\u2019m the closest thing to scratching it \u2014 and they just want to hack whatever into it, and I try to give them easier places to hack that hopefully will make it easier for the rest of the community to pull it back in. But you know? People surprise me all the time! They come up with elaborate ways that are much harder than it would be. And then it\u2019s hard to share it back and then we have to talk to each other and then have a conversation and be engineers and humans and respect each other and figure out how to build a community, right?

I guess this conflates two aspects: one is the security aspect and one of the open source aspect. From a security standpoint, I will fully admit, Precursor takes one of the most extreme positions you can get in terms of trustability and security \u2014 we make a lot of usability sacrifices in the name of absolute trust. That\u2019s because the threat model is so severe! We really took it to an extreme in terms of designing it. Which means that in practice, a more mass-adopted unit will have more features and have more attack surfaces, but you have to find that balance! On the other hand, if we don\u2019t move the goal posts all the way to the end of the field, we\u2019ll never know where it ends! So that\u2019s the idea, is to do that! So I think it\u2019ll probably be at some point in the mass-adoption curve where we realize some things are really important \u2014 like we want to know about our CPU, we want to know about our key store \u2014 and other things probably aren\u2019t as important like the camera or the cellular radio interfaces. We can contain those, right? Those are not actual attack surfaces, just theoretical attack surfaces. And then in terms of the trustability and reliability of the hardware, I mean the open source aspect\u2014the ability to look at it and say what\u2019s there or not \u2014 that will be driven more by\u2014it\u2019s almost a cat and mouse game! In an ideal world, obviously you just\u2014everyone keeps their word! And then there\u2019s no demand for any of this, right? In the security world \u2014 and this is where the dirty secrets of being in the security world [are] \u2014 is that, security experts drive both the supply and the demand for their trade. So if a security expert is not having enough work defending computers, they go into the business of making exploits, which then creates demand for their \u2014 they\u2019re actually one of the few trades that can sort of legally control supply and demand for their efforts right now, right? In a way, what the demand for this sort of open hardware stuff will depend a bit on [is] what we find out in the wild! If it turns out that in practice no one ever finds Bitcoin valuable to go ahead and do a supply chain exploit to steal $10 Million worth of Bitcoin, then there will be no demand for this type of thing! But I think once you actually get a well documented case out in the wild\u2014this is what happened. You both get the lesson, you get not a theoretical thing, but actually a real thing and this has happened and people are like, Okay, well you gotta avoid that! This is essential! That you have to have this standard of inspectability, otherwise you\u2019re vulnerable to this! Then I think people take it more seriously. But unfortunately, human behavior is really bad at doing things that are just good for them, because \u2014 going to the gym, eating well, getting exercise \u2014 very hard for people to do! Because it\u2019s sort of all this preventative maintenance type of thing. Whereas once you have a very immediate feedback that something is bad, people have a much easier time of doing something about it. So the market for open hardware and inspectability and are they gonna be exploits inside of my hardware and how important is it to open it up and this reproducability \u2014 I think it\u2019s gonna depend in part upon what the adversaries do! The other potential outcome maybe is that we have \u2014 and this would be the ideal: we\u2019re all holding hands and rainbows in the world \u2014 we have such a fecund and diverse innovation ecosystem around this, the modularity and everyone\u2019s developing this, these open hardware designs are just desirable because we\u2019re [all] so productive and so interesting, right? I wish we could get there but I\u2019m not holding my breath for that outcome. It\u2019s usually driven more by fear than by inspiration and hope."}

We have a lot of suppliers all over the world and a lot of them are in Asia so we have to give them all these prototypes before Chinese New Year\u2019s. We\u2019re on track to get\u2014when I say certification ready I\u2019m talking about electromagnetic compliance, this is the FCC\u2019s CE sort of stamps I have to have to import to the EU and the rest of the world. We\u2019re in good shape to get those certifications and so I\u2019m very optimistic at the moment that with the pandemic vaccine coming around and whatnot maybe the supply chain will stabilize a bit and we won\u2019t have as much surprises as last year.\nbunnie\nis my Twitter, or check our Precursor.dev and that will land you at all of our stuff including GitHub.

I thought it would be \u2014 when I wrote it, I was actually really worried about the fallout from it. Anytime you go against an existing system that has so much inertia and everything else, and you\u2019re going up against an entire system that we take for granted that we live in! Quite honestly I was really concerned about what that would look like! What that would look like for my family \u2014 everything else. Because normally, even if you\u2019re right on something like that, the world doesn\u2019t want to look at something. So it\u2019s been an amazing ride, largely unexpected."}

And I said, Listen, we don\u2019t need this! Right? Wealthy, have a lot of access, I\u2019m sitting on all of these boards, lot of ownership in a raft of technology companies. And if anything, writing this book puts all of that at risk! Because it\u2019s going up against a system and if I turn into a pariah from going up against the system, people can\u2019t have me on their boards! It could actually hurt a lot of our economic well-being and everything else. So it was that kind of conversation with my wife, but I said, But I still have to do it! It is \u2014 so, yes! Very much! But again, all the boards that I sit on, or all of the technology entrepreneurs that I\u2019m helping, if you actually go down to the root of what they\u2019re doing, most of them aren\u2019t starting a company to say, I\u2019m going to make the most money and I win the game! Most of them are starting a company to say, How do I create a whole bunch of value for society? And so in that\u2014and using technology differently to create a whole bunch of value \u2014 is what they\u2019re really doing! And so I wouldn\u2019t be on any board that didn\u2019t actually think about, How do I create a whole bunch of value for society? So even though it could look like this, I think I pretty much knew any of the people I work with would back 100%."}

So it has different winners/losers: if your money is worth less over time, then debt gets less expensive over time because you pay it back with cheaper money tomorrow. So if you hold a lot of debt, inflation is a really good thing. If you hold assets, inflation takes those assets up with it. But it\u2019s also really bad for money or people that are on fixed income, because it\u2019s losing money!"}

And so, Cedric, in that conversation there\u2019s a whole of bunch of people \u2014 less people that have read my book \u2014 they\u2019re starting to understand this! And a lot of people are starting to understand this construct. But money is just a construct, and inflation is just a construct we believe in! And we set up the rules that it\u2019s always a good thing without even questioning, Is it a good thing? There\u2019s a whole bunch of people \u2014 you\u2019re taught in school that we have to have inflation! Where central banks come out and say, We desperately \u2014 we have to have 2% inflation, it\u2019s so good for society! And that\u2019s kind of that scratching at something that we\u2019ve always been taught to be true \u2014 might just not be true! That breaks your brain!

And re-reading it now I say to myself, If I was reading this 10 years ago I would be so optimistic I would be running out of the room screaming, looking for ways to take a lot of the ideas you put forth around technology and getting involved! And now having gone through the year, I\u2019m a little less optimistic, because 2020 is what it is, and it\u2019s still the opposite of \u2014 you know, coming into the year and reading this book I thought, This idea\u2019s in hand!

Read the book, then read it again, then read it again, then read it again! Because what we\u2019re talking about here is it changes your thinking from one system to another system! But we measure all of our outcomes from an existing system, so it\u2019s really hard for our brains to comprehend what a new system could look like! And so I explore some of that in the book. But I think to what your point is, is I laid out in the book how technology was exponentially deflationary, or it created exponential efficiency, and that efficiency was deflationary. And it was going up against a monetary system that required inflation! And so you could expect exponential monetary easing on the other side. And all that COVID did is accelerated what I\u2019m talking about! It\u2019s just accelerated \u2014 technology is moving faster! I think a lot of people think that technology is an industry, instead of, It\u2019s the base layer of everything that we\u2019re doing!"}

That we still measure productivity gains in all of the language: that we want to see GDP go up, but how does GDP go up from free photos? How does that happen? So a whole bunch of our constructs in measuring the existing system are wrong! Completely wrong! Because technology is moving in the base layer of everything that we\u2019re doing. This video conference we\u2019re on, we couldn\u2019t have done this 20 years ago!"}

I mean I see this in my own life with just podcasting, the hardware has come down in price, the software is providing everything for free that they used to pay a technician to help provide for you or something of that sort. And you point a lot of things out on the book, especially at the beginning, it set the framework and to get our heads around exponentiality. And you talk about governments printing trillions of dollars and trying to understand that 1 trillion seconds is equal to 31,709 years! Just to kind of give some perspective! And you have an anecdote about having dinner with your friend Chen Fong, and you mention having dinner with his parents and them kind of getting a little nervous about what\u2019s happening. And they mention this quip around: first currency wars, then trade wars, and then real wars! Where do you think we are in that sort of parable of thought, or are we not in that moment?"}

And so again, if people could see that all of the pricing of everything around them is just an illusion out of money printing \u2014 and that\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but if my thesis [in the book] was right, that technology is driving exponentially more efficiency, then something on the other side of that ledger should prove that thesis correct! So in the beginning of the book I talked about, We have $250 Trillion of debt to run an $80 Trillion global economy. And those numbers are so staggering! But you could say\u2014if you believed in fairy tales \u2014 you could say maybe we can grow our way out of it. If there\u2019s new industries created, then we could grow our way out of it. If it was just status quo. But taxes would have to go up to grow our way out of it. Right? We\u2019d have to pay back the debt. And the debt is such a staggering number. But then when you realize $185 Trillion of that debt has come over the last 20 years, you see the smoking gun! So, thesis: Technology is driving this, everything is more efficient\u2014deflation. And massive amounts of easing \u2014 exponentially more \u2014 each year are needed to try to stop that, to pretend we still live in an inflationary world! So okay, now what\u2019s the consequence? That\u2019s looking backwards, that\u2019s to 2019. So looking forwards, if technology is still moving exponentially, you have to expect that that $185 Trillion looks like child\u2019s play looking backwards compared to what\u2019s needed looking forwards to stop that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing! Now, in that game, because again \u2014 we don\u2019t measure these things at a system level \u2014 we measure them by independent variables. We look at our housing, we say, Housing always goes up! And fail to ask, would housing have gone up without $185 Trillion of liquidity? Extra liquidity, over the last 20 years? And the simple answer is, No, housing is mispriced! Massively mispriced! As everything else is! Because of that liquidity, that easing pulling forward demand. So the next question is, how long can that continue? But not just continue $100 Trillion more over many years \u2014 exponentially more? To be able to fight the other force of technological deflation! And so, it can continue! If governments can continue printing\u2014resetting their currencies \u2014 essentially devaluing their currencies forever, then it can continue! Because really what they\u2019re doing is, they\u2019re pouring money into a hole. But when you change the rules of what money is by making up new money, somebody loses on the other side of that bet! And there\u2019s a whole bunch of losers on the other side of that bet, including anybody on fixed wages. And so you see revolution in wars emerging as the number one threat to society, because you\u2019re manipulating this. So everything is mispriced \u2014 everything! It\u2019s not natural! But we all live in that mispriced world, and we know it\u2019s going to be more mispriced going forward, and so a whole bunch of the wealthy try to put their money in assets that are going to take advantage of that mispricing. They\u2019re making good decisions in a world gone crazy."}

For myself I remember in college getting my finance degree and long-term capital management was when the framework for me kind of broke. I didn\u2019t form a thesis around it and write a book, but in 2006\u20132007 I had returned home to suburbia Long Island, from San Francisco. And I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood: lots of teachers, plumbers, electricians\u2014people in those fields can do very well! But I would walk around and everybody had new siding and brand new $30,000 cars and you can tell that this was all financed through debt. And this was all 2006\u20132007 and then 2008 we have the great financial crisis. And recently you spoke in front of the House of Commons, and this is kind of the reason I brought this up, maybe those events and government. And also when I was in grad school we studied a lot of accounting fraud, and most of the accounting fraud examples that we studied, the fines never really amounted to anything near the gains from the fraud that usually settled in a no-fault agreement. So one side could argue they were just being aggressive. And so with that underpinning, How much fraud do you think is in Fortune 500 companies? Or the S&P 500? And when did you start to formulate this thesis around debt and the black hole?"}

Now remember, in any system change, they cannot work together! An inflationary monetary policy is incongruent with where technology is going. Technology tries to make everything cheaper, more abundant, and inflationary monetary policy does the opposite. These are forces that are competing against each other \u2014 the only way they can co-exist is with concentration of power by the state. Essentially destroying all free markets. That\u2019s the only way they can co-exist: if people believed in a fairy tale of money and government power forever, and saying, Okay you make all the decisions for me! Then they can co-exist! That would look pretty dystopian. That would look like what China\u2019s trying to do with the currency control. But otherwise these things cannot co-exist! So that was the realization: the technology. When I saw that every single business that I was involved in \u2014 my first business cost me almost $5 Million to create the technology platform, that Shopify today does for $50 a month! And Shopify\u2019s platform today is like 100 times better than what I created over 2 years with $5 Million. It\u2019s the point of technology! It reduces prices and increases abundance! So Kodak going broke\u2014it\u2019s not like we use less photos today. The number of photos is staggering that we use today! And storage has collapsed in price! Everything has collapsed in price along that same axis! [19:47] We have all of that abundance! We have it in our phones! We have it in everything we do! So if it\u2019s moving at that pace, why is everything going up in price? It forces you to ask kind of just a first principle question and saying, It shouldn\u2019t be! And with that you find the smoking gun. And then you realize \u2014 Oh my god!\u2014how much credit is being created out of thin air! What that means, and all of the repercussions to society \u2014 Oh my god! And there\u2019s a reset coming! It can come in a number of different forms, but there is a reset coming!"}

And I\u2019m not gonna say which one at this point because there\u2019s gonna be pieces coming out in time. But he said to me, I read your book last year and it was impossible to disagree with any of it! And I sent it to some top people in government, finance and everything \u2014 Blackstone \u2014 the works. And got back: We have to keep printing. Not, This is wrong! We have to keep printing. And what he said to me over a couple hour conversation is he said, We in media are not doing our job, because everybody is going back to the exact same people saying, How do we solve this? And the exact same people are creating the mess! Now they\u2019re stuck \u2014 now he didn\u2019t say this, it\u2019s what I said \u2014 it\u2019s not bad actors, not invariably all bad people! You could change an actor in a system and it won\u2019t change the system! They are stuck in a system that cannot be solved from the existing system \u2014 it\u2019s impossible! It\u2019s actually mathematically impossible to solve. It\u2019s like \u2014 and I use this example in the book \u2014 it\u2019s like Blockbuster solving Netflix from their stores. It\u2019s impossible! Two totally different systems! And they can\u2019t be solved. So that\u2019s why Bitcoin is advancing so fast! And actually the best chance for a peaceful transition is Bitcoin! That\u2019s a bold statement but I believe it to be true, because it\u2019s a forcing function that is a different system. System change very rarely comes from within. And what we\u2019re seeing is, name somebody right now \u2014 try to find somebody who doesn\u2019t want more easing? Whether it\u2019s more printing for the Left or the Right, I\u2019m gonna make up money for these people, I\u2019m gonna make up money for these people \u2014 there is no free market anymore! It\u2019s gone! And everybody requires \u2014 and if there isn\u2019t any easing, the system would collapse, asset prices would collapse by 90%, homelessness everywhere, banking failure around the globe, and it would be a hard reset, and then it would be reformed in some new system on the other side. That\u2019s what would happen today! [23:55] So it\u2019s no wonder in that policy environment you have governments \u2014 every one of them \u2014 trying to out-print each other! Because they know that that\u2019s true! And every time, they make the system more fragile, but the question is: what would you have them do? There\u2019s a whole bunch of population that \u2014 because they created this problem and didn\u2019t know they were creating it, trying to outrun it, grow the way they\u2019ve always grown, this tiny little bit of inflation will manipulate markets more open, and then it got more and more and more as technology was going the other way \u2014 now we\u2019re way too late! What would you have them do?"}

It\u2019s that \u2014 because if central banks try to do that, then each central bank is gonna control their citizens through that, and then the central banks are gonna try to make their digital currencies stronger against other currencies in trading blocs, from their digital currencies all fighting and playing that same game. Bitcoin solves that. In fact, I think Bitcoin happened faster \u2014 I think if the US goes and embraces it\u2014which is much higher likelihood, because if you look at the US Constitution and everything else, it was all around rights and freedoms of the individual, which created innovation, strong economy \u2014 everything else! And now it\u2019s moving far away from that, but I suspect that if any country could embrace what Bitcoin stands for, it\u2019s actually going to be the US, and you can see in some of the regulation, it\u2019s actually moving that way! But if that happens, it\u2019s kind of checkmate for China\u2019s digital Yuan. It\u2019s a forcing function for that as well. It\u2019s actually probably the best thing geopolitically that could happen. I\u2019m careful on some of these things because these are all probability events, and you\u2019re dealing with something that has such a magnitude on all of our lives, that it\u2019s bound to not be a straight line. There\u2019s gonna be some thrashing back and forth, different policies and everything else. When you hear things like \u2014 The Great Reset \u2014 spoken from multiple different politicians all at the same time, realize that there\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff happening behind that conversation to be able to say, Here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna talk about it. So that Great Reset is probably different governments coming together and creating a different unit of currency, unit of account, to try to bring this back together. What\u2019s great about a reset and what you\u2019re doing and what people are doing is, emboldening more government control. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Or when you hear \u2014 Build Back Better \u2014 when you hear all these things. Now if it was one institution \u2014 I am not for conspiracy theories, this is actors in a system doing their best to protect the system\u2014but, when you hear something from multiple different places, there\u2019s coordination happening behind the scenes on this. When you think about \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this numerous times as well, and I say it because no one else is saying it! \u2014 wherever you are on the environmental climate change discussion, realize that all governments today talking about climate change because people believe it\u2019s such a big deal \u2014 and it is, it\u2019s a big deal \u2014 and they say, We\u2019re gonna invest in solving climate change and we\u2019re gonna print more money to be able to solve climate change. Think of that oxymoron! Because you can\u2019t! The existing system can\u2019t solve climate change!"}

In terms of people in government \u2014 and it\u2019s not so much a conspiracy theory \u2014 it\u2019s people acting with rational incentives and trying to figure out best solutions within the framework that they\u2019ve been presented. And it is a system that maybe overarches people\u2019s abilities to turn the boat around. But how much of it do you think is rational incentives in the system maybe now \u2014 meaning, I might be encouraged to make the pie smaller so that my slice of the pie gets bigger, versus, Let\u2019s grow the pie for everyone and for the benefit of humanity and more that optimistic view of what to do with the choices at hand?"}

And in a book like that I had to cover a lot of ground and simplify these things to make it consumable so people can put the picture together. But some of these things\u2014if you take game theory \u2014 really what you\u2019re saying is, I\u2019m gonna care about my family first \u2014 me first. We don\u2019t think about everyone else in every interaction. Most times we think about what we are individually. We look at our own photos, we look at our own media, we constantly reinforce me, me, me, me, me. Then it\u2019s our family. Then it\u2019s our friends and community. Then it\u2019s nation states. And all of these things are just how people think. Not good, not bad, not anything else. It\u2019s really, really hard to go the other way and say, I\u2019m gonna think about everybody and not me! So when you think about game theory and everything else and these incentives, just go back to that and say, If you have a choice \u2014 you individually have a choice\u2014use Bitcoin as an example, it\u2019s what\u2019s driving it too: I can go in right now and I can protect me and my family and gain a whole bunch of wealth. It\u2019d be a rational decision. Then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, and all of these things are just in concert: if I can buy a house now, get in now before everybody else is in and it\u2019s gonna go up, you don\u2019t need more and more of these things! Or, you need some of them to live, but they\u2019re all rational decisions individually, to be able to take more advantage. And when the system is gamed \u2014 when the entire system is gamed \u2014 you can expect a lot more of that to happen!"}

And not that technology is one thing, and so I want to break it up into different verticals of different aspects of technology that\u2019s been coming out and been talked about for years: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence. Let\u2019s start with self-driving cars: how fast is this coming about? How much can this enhance our economy and our lives? Or is this more of a 20\u201330 year thing?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/xSQ2Z-wlAys", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #27 \u2014 Jeff Booth: Bitcoin is the Forcing Function in the Age of Inflation", "text": "Jeff Booth [35:18]: So instead of focusing on anyone \u2014 because on the immediate time-frame on this \u2014you\u2019ll be wrong by a year or two on any immediate one. And actually by the way, that\u2019s a concept that a number of people mistook the book for, because recency bias \u2014 which we all have \u2014 will look at the existing events right now and discount what\u2019s happening underneath. So some people looked at the artificial intelligence chapter and everything else \u2014 by the way, there is nothing in the artificial intelligence chapter that is not true from first principles, and I\u2019m very close to it! I\u2019m very close to it! So what\u2019s happening in that realm? In some of the different research and different pieces that take deep learning to probabilistic program to other things, to eventually the singularity where computers are smarter than all humans\u2014is a thing and it\u2019s a big thing! Now what people are looking for and what you just asked is, When does the light switch? And that\u2019s the thing that is so crazy \u2014 not the question, but because we\u2019re in the system, we think about it as, Okay, when will everything change, and all jobs go away? And that\u2019s not the point! The point is that it\u2019s actually more and more deflationary, it\u2019s more and more efficient all the way along, until one day it\u2019s completely free! It just keeps on getting more efficient! And so there doesn\u2019t need to be a light switch! The other thing that you asked is, When is our economy better because of that? It\u2019s not! It\u2019s continually worse, because it\u2019s competing against that system! And so people are looking for more and more jobs out of this, and they don\u2019t realize that more inflation to get more and more jobs \u2014 the opposite side of the coin of inflation is wage deflation. So you\u2019re holding onto jobs by making the jobs less of a component of the overall picture by making labor cheaper. And you\u2019re tricking society into doing that so they\u2019re working over and over and over in a job that\u2019s not required anymore, that otherwise would have gone away because technology would have removed it. But if the job went away and you forced prices this high, everybody fails! And they\u2019re scared to death that they can\u2019t eat, they can\u2019t house themselves, everything else, because they\u2019re measuring a system that is so overpriced, that requires prices to continually go up, and their wages are going down in that and it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse. Whereas, if you actually let nature take its course \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about the transition, the transition is difficult \u2014 if you let nature take its course, prices would fall so fast on everything! And they would keep falling, keep falling, keep falling, to free. They would just keep on going down, and you would get the abundance without the game that\u2019s being played!"}

You know, I listened to a conversation between Peter Thiel and Eric Weinstein where they talked about how it sometimes feels like things haven\u2019t changed much since the 1970\u2019s. And I think you answered my question already though where in the sense that, I already look at my iPhone as an extension of my brain.

But you were talking about the Yeezy was being printed out of liquid with 3D printing and additive manufacturing, and I\u2019m just kind of curious \u2014 again, economy aside \u2014 when might those things be more prevalent?

Because some of it\u2019s coming out of the labs. Some of it\u2019s attacking \u2014 if you use 3D additive manufacturing, where would that start? It would probably start in the most expensive industries as it gains traction before it got to us. So just have your listeners go and look at how many airplane parts are created out of additive manufacturing and you\u2019ll see how fast this is moving! And as that reduces its price and increases its efficiency, additive manufacturing gets better and better and it moves into society. So it makes sense that these industries, technology moves in \u2014 it starts in industries that are high cost, reducing prices there first, creating that abundance and then scales out across the board. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening that we miss as a general population because it\u2019s not in our everyday lives yet. We miss how fast it\u2019s happening!"}

And solar is a tiny component growing really fast and decreasing price every year as it grows. But today it\u2019s already one of the lowest cost energy forms! And it\u2019s getting cheaper every year! So if you play the trend on what that means, oil prices are gonna fall! Which is more deflationary. And as that happens, the more new energy coming on at lower cost, and more and more and more at lower cost, you can see that the number one driver of everything else, because energy is a construct in everything we do, everything that\u2019s used is built using energy. Entire war machine is really to protect energy, because if you have a lower cost energy, your economy was better. And that structural change is happening in our lifetimes! It\u2019s happening right now! And we can see it around us. And again, people are looking to the light switch moment. The light switch moment doesn\u2019t matter at all! It\u2019s just, if you look at the trend of what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s already right in front of us! It means prices should be coming down everywhere!

But that next step \u2014 simply ask this, Why, for the longest time, JP Morgan and all the banks, everyone was totally against Bitcoin, and now why are they for it? Because they were the number one beneficiary of printing! Because they were at the top of the stack, and they could take all of their bad loans and bad assets, put them on the feds, and get new money, to be able to create and lend to society just on an accounting trick! And so that whole stack was at the top of the pyramid, and all of the banks were the biggest beneficiaries of central bank policies over the last 30 years! They couldn\u2019t lose! Because they couldn\u2019t fail! So it\u2019s a really good place, to have a one-way bet to win!

But today, how could you slow it? When I talk about The Great Reset and everything else, if you could have enough governments come together and create a new unit of value and agree on the rules that looked something like Bitcoin, that still gave them control \u2014 so that Great Reset idea, that Build Back Better idea \u2014 if enough governments got together to do that, you could slow Bitcoin. Because people might believe [that] and then slow the on-ramps to Bitcoin. I suspect in this environment \u2014 for those governments to come together to reset all of their imbalances and fiscal balances and everything else in this global trade thing \u2014 in this environment, that\u2019s an impossible task! It\u2019s an impossible task at the US level \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 let alone international governments and everything else. And why? For the same thing we talked about in game theory before: because everybody\u2019s after their own best interests! And so those types of events are typically only reset through war, not through people coming together. They\u2019re reset through war! So by the time governments try to figure out what that looks like, Bitcoin is gonna have broad adoption and it\u2019s gonna be a forcing function! But if you asked, What could happen?

It requires it! Because every other path concentrates wealth and power! Is that fair? Every other path concentrates wealth and power manipulation! So today where we are in technology, it\u2019s a requirement of any monetary policy that it allows for deflation. Otherwise you concentrate wealth and power. Now go to the next level: what is the most likely candidate to drive that change? The most likely candidate \u2014 [look at] already how fast Bitcoin\u2019s growing \u2014 is the candidate that is a forcing function from outside the system. It is a forcing function to that change! Will there be a whole bunch of stuff in the existing system that tries to protect it? Like Blockbuster adding candy aisles to their stores? Yes! Can it solve the problem? No!

So if you\u2019re that person, you almost have to hold two thoughts concurrently at the same time: (1) what the existing system looks like, and why it looks like this, and then (2) what it will do to try to protect itself as you move to a new system, as you try to accrue benefits to whoever can accrue benefits to the new system. But those two different things \u2014 because they\u2019re so different \u2014 are really hard for people to control in their minds! They go into the one system and essentially they\u2019re so scared of the transition or anything else that they can\u2019t actually look at logic! So they go back to, Well I need more money! The government should print more money and give it to me!"}

You ask a few questions towards the end of the book that I ask myself every day. You framed them up really well though! And some of the reasons I\u2019ve maybe even challenged you on some of these notions is because, How many of our own beliefs stand up to the facts? To future generations, How many of our current actions fueled by those beliefs will look outright foolish? How do we overcome our errors, bias, and narratives that make up our operating system? And I ask these kinds of questions because I have so much conviction, and I believe you do too! And I still want to challenge our convictions! And that made me think a lot about how with just technology, how much information we deal with every day, how the world\u2019s information is doubling at an incredible rate! How do you decide or choose what information to consume, and maybe even in what form? Because time management is an issue! Time is scarce! You\u2019re not gonna know everything in the world, therefore maybe even we\u2019re wrong about some of the things we\u2019re [convinced] on \u2014 I\u2019m not getting at Bitcoin here \u2014 maybe on other things in our lives. But how do you deal with all that?"}

And by doing that, if you put yourself first with humility and say, I make these mistakes too \u2014 we all do. You can notice even on Twitter, a lot of times I don\u2019t say, You, You, You. I say, We, and, Me. I also make them. And then what do I do to avoid those mistakes? And you just hit on a really interesting thread that I think about: every abundance creates scarcity. So, (1) today we have an abundance of information and misinformation. And (2) on that, we are likely to click on things that we like or agree with and hang out with people that we like and agree with, because they reinforce \u2014 because it\u2019s easier. It reinforces our belief system! So I\u2019m bombarded with information, and we don\u2019t like to look at information that doesn\u2019t match our narrative. Me too! We all do! It\u2019s a natural fact! And so, how do I \u2014 if that\u2019s the truth, and I\u2019m just as likely as everybody else to do that \u2014 make sure that I spend my time, my most valuable asset, in things that don\u2019t get sucked into that vortex? And it\u2019s hard! You have to force yourself to look at other points of view with a really open mind! To be able to debate somebody else\u2019s point of view, like you know it better than them! And then come back to yours and look at something from all sides to realize that. And you can\u2019t do that on every single item, you just don\u2019t have the time to do it on every single item! So where are the things that are deeper? First principles that are \u2014 and money and power are pretty big! So what are the ones that are core to a whole bunch of other decisions that I might get wrong too? Go deeper on those ones, and then just keep asking why? Is it a belief or is it a fact? And that\u2019s really important today, because there\u2019s a whole bunch of people \u2014 you see it on Twitter all the time \u2014 that are shouting because of a belief! And a belief that is completely wrong, that doesn\u2019t have any facts! So is it a belief or a fact? And just keep on asking, Why do I believe that? Is that true? Is it for sure true? Or is it a belief? I understand because it\u2019s hard for anybody to do that, and the more information and the more information silos\u2014with both of those two things \u2014 make it even harder!"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: To give you the big picture first, what we\u2019re seeing now is new developments in global anti-money laundering regulation, which is the set of rules that require financial institutions. So for our purposes: Bitcoin exchanges, custodians, and payment processors, to KYC or to collect due diligence information about their customers, like names, addresses, social security numbers, other information \u2014 to record that information and then also to report it to the governments, depending on what jurisdiction you\u2019re in. Here in the US, we focus most on the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the federal law that requires a variety of crypto companies including money transmitters to comply with those anti-money laundering obligations. [04:44] What\u2019s happening now \u2014 and I think the reason this was the right time for us to get together \u2014 is, the financial crimes enforcement network, or FinCEN, which is a bureau of the US Treasury department, has proposed a new rule that would expand the anti-money laundering obligations of those crypto companies beyond where they\u2019ve ever been before. Up until now the majority of the anti-money laundering obligations only applied to transactions of Bitcoin between crypto companies, as in, you\u2019re sending Bitcoin from one exchange to another exchange, or from one exchange to a custodian or some other regulated company. What FinCEN is proposing, essentially, is to expand those record-keeping and reporting obligations to transactions between institutions and wallets. Meaning, the company would have to do some KYC for transactions that a customer like you or me would try to either withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange to our own wallet, or deposit Bitcoin into the exchange from our wallet. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here right now in the US!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Stephan Livera [06:03]: So there are a few terms mentioned inside this new proposed regulation. Perhaps you could spell out what they mean? So they say CVC and LTDA. What do those mean?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Yeah so those are peculiar terms to FinCEN. Basically every government agency comes up with its own acronyms to describe the types of things that we all talk about very differently in the industry. CVC stands for Convertible Virtual Currency. It\u2019s basically just FinCEN\u2019s word for any cryptocurrency or digital asset. Just as an example, the SEC \u2014 the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 uses the term digital asset to describe the same thing. So it\u2019s just a peculiar term for cryptocurrencies or digital assets in general. LTDA is actually a new one that I haven\u2019t seen before until just now! It stands for Legal Tender Digital Asset, which I think we would think of as a CBDC \u2014 a Central Bank Digital Currency \u2014 meaning, a cryptocurrency that is officially issued by a government, and represents not just a stablecoin that reflects the value of a fiat currency, but actually is recognized as an offical fiat currency."}

While we\u2019re on this whole terminology thing, I think many in the community would perhaps bristle at some of the terminology going around! Obviously we were joking on Twitter about self-hosted or unhosted wallets. Why is there this big difference in the way the terminology is being used? Is this essentially an attempt to reframe the conversation around privacy and sovereignty in our wallets?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky [07:54]: Yes I think it is! As I mentioned, the government sort of adopts terms that fit their narrative. I think virtual currency is actually one of them! Something that\u2019s virtual sounds lesser than something that is real. And similarly, the government has adopted the terms hosted wallet and unhosted wallet to describe what we would think of as simply an account at a third-party custodian, or, your own wallet. And I think the reason that they\u2019ve done that in large part is, something that is hosted \u2014 a hosted wallet \u2014 sort of sounds safe! Right? It\u2019s hosted, there\u2019s someone in charge, it\u2019s all neat and tidy. Whereas something that is unhosted sounds dangerous. There\u2019s no one hosting it, who knows what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s kind of wild and out of control! And I do think that\u2019s the signal that some folks are trying to send by using the terms hosted and unhosted. [08:58] There\u2019s a third term that you mentioned which is self-hosted. I think that one has been a little bit confused among folks on Bitcoin Twitter. Self-hosted is not a term the government has been pushing. It was actually the industry\u2019s response to the term unhosted, in an attempt to say, These wallets are not some scary, wild, uncontrolled, unhosted thing. These wallets belong to real people who are exercising their rights of self-sovereignty in control of their own property, by \u201chosting\u201d their own wallets for themselves! And I think that wasn\u2019t received totally well because I think you and I would agree, we should really just call these accounts hosted at a third-party, or wallets, because a wallet is the default. But that\u2019s sort of the genesis of that term."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Stephan Livera [10:15]: Of course. So let\u2019s dive a little bit further into exactly what the burden\u2014or reporting obligation, rather \u2014 is on some of these Bitcoin exchanges or companies that are regulated. So can you tell us a little bit about the typical reporting obligations and how that would shift under the new proposed regulation?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Sure. Under current law, regulated institutions have to comply with something called the travel rule, which you probably hear about a lot. And what the travel rule basically says is, when a regulated institution sends Bitcoin or some other digital asset to another regulated exchange, along with the asset must travel information about the parties who are making the transaction. So if an institution is sending Bitcoin to some other institution, they have to include information about the customer who has sent that transaction. The travel rule essentially applies internationally. So it is a US law, but the same travel rule has essentially been implemented in every major jurisdiction with the exception of some places that you think of as offshore banking havens that the westernized world is trying to bring into compliance. But the travel rule has never applied to transactions outside the world of those regulated financial institutions! Anti-money laundering compliance obligations in general do not apply to individuals who are transacting on their own behalf. It only applies when there is a third-party intermediary that\u2019s transferring funds on behalf of customers or on behalf of other people. The proposal that FinCEN has put forward now is similar to what has come to be known as the Swiss rule. This is a sort of different implementation of the travel rule that Switzerland came out with earlier this year, which says that exchanges \u2014 or other regulated institutions \u2014 also have to collect information about transactions with wallets. Not just transactions with other institutions. The Swiss rule says that in order to process a transaction between institution and wallet, the institution must verify the beneficial owner of the wallet. Meaning, to figure out basically who owns the private key so you can figure out who is the person receiving these funds. And the proposal from FinCEN is very similar. It doesn\u2019t use the word verify, but what it says is: the regulated institution must obtain and retain the name and physical address of the counterparty of a transaction. Meaning, if you\u2019re, let\u2019s just say Kraken for example \u2014 you\u2019re a Kraken customer \u2014 and you want to withdraw Bitcoin to your own wallet, you would have to provide your name and physical address associated with the public key that you are withdrawing Bitcoin to. And similarly, if you wanted to withdraw Bitcoin from Kraken to someone else\u2019s wallet, you would have to give Kraken the name and physical address of that person even though they are not affiliated in any way with Kraken, or with whatever institution you\u2019re using! [13:54] So it\u2019s an expansion of anti-money laundering obligations in a way that will jeopardize the privacy of more people who are using Bitcoin."}

Now, we want to do withdrawals only to you and can you just certify this is only going to you and that you\u2019re not actually directly spending that out to, say, a merchant for example. Is that something we might see?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: It\u2019s certainly possible! The problem with these requirements is it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to prove who the owner is of a string of letters and numbers. Right? How do you prove the owner of a private key? And so what ends up happening is, these regulated institutions get very confused about how they can comply with these regulations. But they have to comply one way or another or they could be at risk of being penalized for violating the regulation. So one way to mitigate the risk of a violation is for an institution to say, Look, we\u2019re just not gonna allow withdrawals or deposits involving some other third party who isn\u2019t one of our customers, someone we don\u2019t have a business relationship with, someone who hasn\u2019t signed our Terms & Conditions, potentially waiving liability or other rights and litigation, so we\u2019re only going to allow these transactions with our customer. That would obviously be a significant limitation! I think that the biggest fear though, is that these institutions would say, Even for our customers, we fundamentally do not understand how we can verify the owner of a private key, because anyone else in the world could have the same string of letters and numbers and therefore have access to the Bitcoin associated with that private key! So we\u2019re just not gonna allow withdrawals and deposits at all! We\u2019re gonna essentially mandate custody and cut off transactions with people\u2019s wallets. That would be an extreme result, but I do think we need to be at least cautious about the possibility that that\u2019s where this is heading."}

And then what would happen to the Bitcoin network at that point? All the Bitcoin that is sort of outside of that walled garden \u2014 it would just be a very weird situation! Probably an interesting example you might have seen is in the Netherlands, there was an example of an exchange called Bitonic, and they were asking for basically a wallet screenshot. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily verify that this person \u2014 well first of all, they could have just shown a screenshot from someone else\u2019s wallet! What\u2019s your take on that aspect? Could that be a way that some Bitcoin businesses try to comply with this rule, even if it\u2019s not technically bulletproof there?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky [17:15]: It certainly could be! I think this gets back to theories of regulation. Let\u2019s assume for a second that we think that regulation is appropriate in the first place \u2014 which I think maybe you and some of the audience might not agree with! Let\u2019s just accept that premise for a minute! What you want in good regulation is clarity about how the target of the regulation can comply. Generally speaking, businesses are not that afraid of regulation as long as they know how to comply, as long as they\u2019re not worried that something\u2019s gonna go wrong, and they\u2019re gonna get tied up in some lengthy investigation or enforcement action that\u2019s going to result in significant penalties. So you want your regulators to be clear about how companies can comply! I think in this instance, it is very unclear, including in the case of the Netherlands, how a regulated institution can verify the owner of a private key, as you said \u2014 a screenshot could be from anywhere! Also, I could sign a message using a private key \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m the only one that has that private key! So I think that there are a lot of open questions about how someone can comply with this rule. The hope is that regulators are providing some clarity to say, Look if you do it this way, if you take a screenshot, we\u2019re not gonna come after you! But again in terms of good regulation, that should be made clear to the public, not just to companies behind closed doors! And we\u2019re not seeing that kind of public process that we would expect in the case of good regulation that works well."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: It really depends on how regulators interpret this! If they were to say, in FinCEN\u2019s example specifically, It is enough for the customer who is processing the withdrawal \u2014 receiving the deposit \u2014 to simply say the name and physical address of the counterparty to the transaction, and no further diligence is required. I suppose the compliance cost is fairly low, but the compliance cost is only one factor to consider. There are others. In terms of a chilling effect I think first of all this is a pretty significant infringement of privacy rights! I think that it\u2019s very different from regulations that have applied in traditional finance \u2014 the very specific targeting toward Bitcoin \u2014 in the sense that, when you withdraw paper cash from a bank, you do not need to prove anything about where the cash is going when you withdraw it. And similarly if you deposit cash at the bank, you do not need to prove where the cash is coming from. And to have this additional burden on the individual to hand over more information about the people that they\u2019re conducting financial transactions with is a significant infringement of their privacy rights \u2014 very different from what we\u2019ve seen before! [20:33] And you can imagine that customers who don\u2019t want to sacrifice their privacy rights would simply leave the jurisdiction! They would start patronizing companies in other jurisdictions! Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, and so I think that there\u2019s a chilling effect in that sense. I also think it may just discourage people from taking custody of their own assets. They may not want to deal with these compliance burdens and they may decide, You know what? I\u2019m just gonna leave these assets in custody because I don\u2019t want to deal with it! And I think all of that is really harmful to Bitcoin! And certainly not worth the alleged benefits that these regulations would provide [to the] government."}

And so it pushes people in certain ways because now those non-US companies are often just saying, We don\u2019t want you if you\u2019re a US customer! Because we don\u2019t want to deal with that compliance burden! But in a small way like you were saying, maybe US customers will then go and be customers in some other Bitcoin business overseas so that they don\u2019t have to deal with as much of the compliance and that aspect of it!"}

You make a great point. The more likely outcome is not so much that US citizens start using businesses abroad, but rather that US companies leave, and decide not to serve as US citizens. And as you point out, the US government tends to think that it has unlimited extra territorial jurisdiction, that its laws apply all over the world no matter where you are or who you are. And FATCA is the perfect example of how the US used its \u2014 basically the way that its ability to tax companies and to exclude them from the US economy \u2014 to force them to comply with US law even though they were outside the US. We see the same thing with someone like BitMEX, where BitMEX was not based in the US, and was at least making some attempt \u2014 although debatable how effective it was \u2014 to exclude US citizens from its platform, but because there were a couple of US citizens on the platform, the US governments view was, they\u2019re a strict liability for compliance with US law! If you service one US citizen, then you must comply with the full panoply of US laws! And so it is very hard to escape US jurisdiction and I do perceive this as another attempt by US government to reassert its authority globally over the operation of the financial system as a whole. US foreign policy is administered through the country\u2019s control of the financial system, and Bitcoin is essentially an existential threat to that control. Or at least it could be perceived that way \u2014 I\u2019m not sure it really is! But I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this rising concern over a peer-to-peer financial system that does not require the operation of intermediaries that the government can easily regulate."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Right so this gets straight to the point that we were just discussing, which is: the US government wants to make sure that its rules are followed globally. But there are some jurisdictions where there are some companies that simply refuse to comply! Especially in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran or North Korea or Venezuela or Myanmar \u2014 places like that. And the requirement of the foreign jurisdictions list basically says: We\u2019re also going to extend anti-money laundering compliance obligations for record-keeping and recording. Not just the transactions between institutions and wallets, but also between institutions that are compliant with the Bank Secrecy Act, and institutions in jurisdictions that do not comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. So when an exchange, for example, sends let\u2019s say $15,000 worth of Bitcoin to another regulated exchange that is compliant with the travel rule, the sending exchange does not need to report anything to the government, because the travel rule has been followed. What this new rule would say is: if the institution can\u2019t be sure that the other institution is compliant, then they do need to submit one of those reports to the government. So this is really another way for US government to get more control over institutions in those places that are refusing to play along with the rules that government is setting."}

So an example would be: suspicious matter reporting, or threshold reporting, where if the value goes above a certain amount, these transactions have to get reported to the government agencies like the IRS or to other law enforcement. Does this proposal mean that more data and more information is going to those government agencies, rather than the government agency having to colloquially \u201cget a warrant\u201d or to go through some legal process to ask for that information?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky [26:45]: Yeah that\u2019s right. So there\u2019s a difference between an exchange being forced under a subpoena for example, to turn over information to government, versus the exchange having an affirmative obligation to automatically report that information to government. And I think that\u2019s one of the big differences here. Under current law, an exchange certainly already has all of this information about withdrawals to folks\u2019 wallets. But they aren\u2019t automatically turning that information over to the government in the form of a currency transaction report. And in fact, many of the exchanges will even publish information about what kinds of requests they\u2019re getting from government: how many subpoenas they\u2019re getting, how many of them they\u2019re challenging, how many of them they\u2019re actually having to comply with to turn over customer information. This new rule would greatly limit the ability of these exchanges and other companies to protect the privacy of their customers. And that\u2019s a really big concern, not only because in general we should respect consumer privacy and the privacy of people who are transacting in Bitcoin, but also because government just hasn\u2019t shown that they are either using that information effectively \u2014 and we could have a really interesting debate about whether the anti-money laundering system we have, which depends on financial surveillance, is even working, if it\u2019s even helping law enforcement to detect and prosecute crime \u2014 but also, government hasn\u2019t shown that they are able to safeguard that information. I mean just recently there was a report of a massive hack of the US treasury department specifically, in which an extraordinary amount of sensitive information was lost to hackers. And as we record this we still don\u2019t really have a good sense of what information was compromised and for how long! And I think that the idea that now is a good time to expand the government\u2019s warrant-less mass surveillance and data collection operations in light of everything that\u2019s been going on, is simply wrong!"}

And so now if let\u2019s say in this example where a lot more information must be reported by the Bitcoin regulated company to FinCEN with all the reporting, then there\u2019s gonna be all this data out there of people\u2019s names, potentially their address, and which Bitcoin address they withdrew the Bitcoins to \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of potential information that could go to a very dark place if that information were to fall into the wrong hands!"}

And you know, two things on that: (1) this is really sensitive information! This isn\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not talking about something unimportant. We\u2019re talking about critical information not just where people live, right? The FinCEN proposal called for collecting the physical addresses of people who are withdrawing Bitcoin to their own wallets. It\u2019s very much like the Ledger hack. If you\u2019re loading up a hardware wallet with a lot of value in Bitcoin, you probably don\u2019t want people to know what your home address is! It\u2019s very sensitive information! (2) What government would say about this concern that these jackpots of sensitive information are being exposed by hackers \u2014 what they would say is: that\u2019s a cybersecurity problem. The problem is that companies are not doing a good enough job of protecting customer data. So we need to pass even more regulation, right? The GDPR for example \u2014 to require companies to do a better job of maintaining their customers\u2019 privacy. And I think the other side of that policy debate is the one that I would take and probably the one most Bitcoiners would take, which is: this data cannot be protected! There is no perfect cybersecurity system that is going to prevent these jackpots from being compromised! The solution is to simply not create the jackpots in the first place, and given that collecting all this information is yielding very little benefit to government in the first place, maybe we would be better served by simply not collecting it at all!"}

We\u2019ve got to think about also the broader context here as some lawyers in this space such as yourself and others have been commenting that this is like a midnight rulemaking. What is that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: So midnight rulemaking is a term that describes the circumstance where a policy-maker is about to leave office. They\u2019ve maybe a month of time left, and they\u2019re trying to jam through some rule as fast as possible without following the regular order for considering whether the policy that they\u2019re trying to put into place is even good to begin with! Typically this occurs in the US in the transition period between presidencies. So we had a presidential election at the beginning of November. Donald Trump lost the election to Joe Biden. President-elect Biden will take office on January 20th. And at that point the treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is out of a job. And really, this new regulation is something that Steve Mnuchin uniquely wants to pass! This is really not something that the entire treasury department is behind. It\u2019s really something that secretary Mnuchin believes personally is important. And it\u2019s something he wants to accomplish before he leaves office. So what he\u2019s done basically is to violate the regular order for considering a proposed rule like this. In the United States there\u2019s a federal law called the Administrative Procedures Act, the APA, which sets up the requirements for administrative rule making. And what it says basically is: an agency \u2014 before they can put a new rule into place \u2014 has to give the public notice of what the proposed rule is, and has to give the public an opportunity to comment on whether the rule is good or not! Whether it could be improved, whether it\u2019s flawed, what the cost-benefit is of the new rule. This is called notice and comment rule making. And for a significant rule \u2014 one that\u2019s gonna have a really big impact on industry or in society at large \u2014 an agency is supposed to give at least 60 days for the public to give comments. And then usually there\u2019s a long process after that where there\u2019s discussion and the back and forth between the industry and the agency, about whether the rule is good or not! And in this circumstance, because Secretary Mnuchin doesn\u2019t have 60 days \u2014 he has only 30 at the time we\u2019re recording this, before he\u2019s out of office\u2014he decided that for this rule there should only be 15 days for the public to comment! And not just 15 days, but 15 days at the end of December leading into early January over Christmas and New Year\u2019s when most people are trying to take a vacation! So the fear is that this is not a genuine process where Secretary Mnuchin is really soliciting input from the public that he will consider before deciding what he wants to do. But rather, that he already knows what he wants to do, and he\u2019s just sort of trying vaguely to go through the steps required to defend the rule from a legal challenge. But really this is a done deal and probably truly at midnight \u2014 the day before he is out of office \u2014 he\u2019ll decide to make this rule effective!"}

Is that correct?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Yes that\u2019s right! Sometimes it\u2019s not the actual public comment period where the public can submit formal comments, but where the agency will then \u2014 after an initial 60 or 90 or 120-day comment period \u2014 will then schedule meetings. They\u2019ll hold round-tables with the industry, they\u2019ll do panels, they\u2019ll talk at conferences, they\u2019ll revise the proposed rule and they\u2019ll republish it and solicit new comments based on the revisions to the rule. And certainly there are circumstances where it does take years to craft good rules. And again, to the extent that we agree that it is appropriate to regulate something like Bitcoin, it is totally fair to believe that for something so novel and unique, something so different from what financial regulators have ever confronted before, there should be a really considered and nuanced, intelligent discussion, not a rush to put any new regulation that has very little benefit for government, at the cost of a huge burden to the industry and to individuals, just because one presidential candidate lost an election and doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time left for his administration to put in the rules that they\u2019ve already decided are appropriate."}

Some in the short term and some in the longer term. Right now we are confronted with this 30-day sprint where this rule may become effective before January 20th. And as the saying goes, laws are written in ink. They\u2019re very hard to erase! So what we really want to do is stop this rule from becoming effective before January 20th. Once there is new leadership in charge of the treasury department, we strongly believe that we will be able to convince leadership at FinCEN not to make this rule effective. And when I say we what I mean is the group of policy folks in Washington D.C. who work on these issues. So that means CoinCenter, which does phenomenal work, the Blockchain Association which is the group that I do most of my work through, the Chamber of Digital Commerce \u2014 all of these policy organizations are working very hard to stop this rule from going into effect. The way that folks can help us achieve that goal is first by submitting public comments. I\u2019ll be sure to provide more information about how to do that over the next couple weeks. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of time, but whatever we can do to convey the message that the process behind this rule and the substance of this rule are both unacceptable, the better chance we have of convincing Secretary Mnuchin that he should not take this last shot at Bitcoin on his way out the door. I also think that in terms of what we can do through the Blockchain Association and otherwise is, we can consider a legal challenge to this rule if it does go into effect. And that is something we are exploring now. We\u2019ve hired one of the best lawyers in the country, Paul Clement, who was the US Solicitor General under President George W. Bush, one of the most respected lawyers in the country, to help evaluate grounds to challenge this rule under the PA. And if it comes to it \u2014 I think that is likely what we will do \u2014 we will file a lawsuit and we will try to get a judge to stop enforcement of the rule hopefully long enough that we can have a change of administration and then FinCEN will have some cover to walk away from this rule. So that\u2019s all in the short term. I also just want to say, in the long term, I think we need to understand that this is just the beginning! Secretary Mnuchin is particularly hostile to Bitcoin, but that doesn\u2019t mean that once he\u2019s gone, everything is gonna be fantastic and great and wonderful! There are a lot of other policy makers in the US and globally for example within the Financial Action Task Force, the FATF, that believe in regulation like this! So what we really need to do long term is get a lot better at boiling down our arguments of why Bitcoin is so important. Why the benefits of allowing peer-to-peer transactions, of allowing self-sovereignty, why they outweigh the supposed costs to law enforcement. And furthermore why this phenomenon can\u2019t be stopped in the first place! All a country can really do is push this activity into other jurisdictions. They can\u2019t really stop it. So the better we are at making those arguments long term, the better we\u2019re gonna be at defeating this final boss that is trying to over-regulate Bitcoin."}

That is, Bitcoin that people actually hold themselves and are able to use and send in peer-to-peer transactions and custody themselves. And then no bridge between those two worlds. Every bank and every exchange would be prohibited from allowing deposits or withdrawals to people\u2019s wallets. I think that that is an alarmist view and I don\u2019t want to scare anyone too much, because there are a lot of people that will say that I\u2019m being paranoid and that\u2019s not really where we\u2019re going. But I fear, if you listen closely to policy makers, that what you hear from them is, they\u2019re okay with Bitcoin, as long as it looks likes digital gold in the same way as gold has been centralized in depositories that can be censored. As long as it doesn\u2019t pose a threat to monetary sovereignty, as long as it doesn\u2019t pose any other risks of terrorist financing or money laundering or other illicit activity. And that to me would be the worst case scenario, a total prohibition on transactions with non-custodial wallets. I\u2019m optimistic that we will not get there, I think that we have very strong arguments why that is a categorically worse world, and also why it is not an achievable world. But I do think that\u2019s sort of the final boss that we have to fight here."}

Could you give us some background on what their influence is on all of this, and perhaps their influence on the domestic regulators around the world such as FinCEN?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Sure. So the FATF is an international standard setting body comprised of about 40 or so member jurisdictions. So you know the United States and Australia and Germany and all these other countries are members of and send representatives to the FATF. The FATF doesn\u2019t make any law, but what it does do is it makes recommendations for global industry standards. That it then sort of expects all of its members to adopt. And it does reviews on a regular basis of whether its various members have sufficiently complied with those rules. And the only teeth that the FATF has is they maintain a blacklist that basically says, If there\u2019s a jurisdiction that is really out of compliance, then no other jurisdiction should be allowed to transact with that jurisdiction. It\u2019s very much like US sanctions, and there\u2019s a lot of crossover between US sanctions and the FATF blacklist. The interesting thing is, the FATF bounces back and forth between setting its own standards that the member jurisdictions follow, versus following the lead of one or more of the member jurisdictions. Sort of like a pendulum in that sense. So sometimes the US, for example, will decide, Here\u2019s what we think the industry standard should be. And then they get the FATF to adopt whatever that is as its recommendation for the world. And sometimes vice versa, the FATF will actually generate some new recommendation that will bring member jurisdictions into compliance. Right now, what we\u2019re trying to figure out is, is the FATF going to recommend this Swiss rule or something like this new FinCEN proposed rule, that imposes AML obligations on transactions between institutions and wallets, or not! And so far they actually haven\u2019t. So Switzerland and the Netherlands which you mentioned, and the United States, are actually out ahead of what the FATF most recently recommended. So in June of this year the FATF did its 12-month review of its crypto guidance. And what it said basically was, We considered whether any restrictions on peer-to-peer transactions were necessary and thus far we decided there\u2019s insufficient evidence to warrant such new restrictions. But, some of our members expressed concern about this, and we will revisit this as we go forward. So one of the next big turning points that we\u2019re looking to in the coming year is the FATF\u2019s next 12-month review, which should be around June 2021. If they adopt this new Swiss rule or new FinCEN proposal as the global industry standard, then you could imagine seeing what is happened so far in only a couple of jurisdictions very quickly being rolled out to dozens of more jurisdictions and becoming the global standard. So I think we need to work very hard to convince policy makers at the FATF that that is not a good idea! But that\u2019s only something to watch."}

Yes that there is a lot that people can do on the local level, and it\u2019s always important to point out that politics is local! And ultimately although many of our democratic are not functioning very well these days, our governments are at least supposed to answer to us the people. And to the extent that we can support and elect policy \u2014 elected officials specifically \u2014 who do not think that these requirements are necessary, and who will push back on them if other members of the government are trying to advance them, the better off we\u2019re gonna be! So here in the US as an example, there are members of Congress who fundamentally oppose this new proposal from FinCEN. In fact, four members of Congress sent a letter to FinCEN led by Warren Davidson, a member of the House of Representatives, advising Secretary Mnuchin that this was a bad idea! And the more of that kind of support we can generate just from a grassroots level by supporting politicians and officials who believe in the principles that we believe in \u2014 the principles that support Bitcoin \u2014 the more success that we\u2019re going to have. The reason I say also Yes but also No, is because in general the FATF is comprised of representatives who are not elected \u2014 they are appointed. And Secretary Mnuchin himself is not elected himself, he was appointed. So no one in the United States cast a single vote for this one individual who has more impact on financial regulatory policy than anybody else. And so it\u2019s very difficult to rein in the expansion of the administrative state. So it\u2019s really hard to get directly to the FATF, but much easier for us to focus on who are we voting for, and what do they believe? And will they make sure that the appointed officials \u2014 who are part of the administrative state \u2014 will they make sure that those folks are not doing things that compromise our privacy and our self-sovereignty?"}

I\u2019m listening with great interest to a lot of your discussion about libertarian ideals and Austrian economics.

I think that you can\u2019t deny that government has influence over the rise of Bitcoin. And basically we can do this the easy way or the hard way. And I think we would all rather do this the easy way than the hard way! I totally appreciate that there is no way that the government could ban Bitcoin. At the same time I would rather not go back to a world where we have to meet up with people in back alleys in order to buy Bitcoin that we can actually custody for ourselves. And that requires us to be engaged in the policy process. It\u2019s not for everyone, and there are some people who just don\u2019t want to get involved in a place like Washington D.C. or any of the other political capitols of the world. That\u2019s fine!

Ideally what this leads to is more time for the industry as a whole to professionalize, to mature, to build more products and services that people can use to protect their own sovereignty and to protect their own privacy. So that if someday we do lose this battle from a policy perspective and government just decides, We cannot get our minds around Bitcoin, we\u2019re just not going to allow this to happen \u2014 at least we\u2019ve gone as far down the road as we can before we have that adverse result! At the same time I think that there is great opportunity for Bitcoin to rise in a cooperative way, in a symbiotic way, in a way that does not result in infringement of our rights, and I would at least like to hold out hope that we can make that happen!"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky [54:47]: Yeah. Honestly there\u2019s too many to list or even to keep track of! But I\u2019ll give you at least a couple of ideas and I think we can work on continuing to build this out as time goes on. One is about financial inclusion. I think that that\u2019s an idea that everyone can get behind. That most people in the world as a whole do not have access to reliable financial services. We\u2019re talking about people who live in places where the banks themselves are the criminal enterprise, and there is no way to conduct commerce because there is no way to transact with other people in a safe way at a distance. And I think that Bitcoin is the greatest force for financial inclusion that we can imagine! I think one person to listen to very carefully on that issue for example is Alex Gladstein at the Human Rights Foundation, because he does such a phenomenal job of highlighting cases where people are using Bitcoin not as a speculative investment \u2014 which is what I think a lot of policy makers in the developed world think that it is \u2014 but truly as a tool for commerce, and a tool to help them live better lives! I also think that there are arguments we can make about the ills of the financial system as it has come up around these very large, very powerful institutions that do not have our best interests at heart. And we\u2019re seeing this now with the rise of major tech companies that have started to dominate the Internet in the same way that the mega-banks have dominated finance. And really, what we don\u2019t want to see is \u2014 with all due respect to Facebook \u2014 we don\u2019t want to see the Facebooks of the world take over finance the way that they\u2019ve taken over the Internet. And Bitcoin is the response to that! It\u2019s public payments infrastructure, as opposed to a proprietary platform run by a company that is serving its own bottom-line at the expense of its customers instead of on behalf of its customers. Those are just two ideas that I think are particularly persuasive. But I think one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is there is an argument that will persuade anyone if you could just figure out what principles matter to them and how Bitcoin addresses those principles! Maybe it\u2019s too much of a meme at this point, but Bitcoin fixes this! I know there is always some kind of argument that we can make to persuade folks to get onboard, and I\u2019m confident that the more we focus on sharpening those arguments, the more impactful they will be!"}

And I guess in this instance, although many of us are libertarian as we don\u2019t necessarily want big government, we want small or zero government, but in terms of meeting the other person where they are at \u2014 in some cases if you have to make an argument to somebody who is in that sort of position \u2014 perhaps an argument might be, Well, if you want your economy to be thriving, you\u2019ve got to care about jobs and businesses! And if you create this regulation and this legislation that is too burdensome, you will create a chilling effect where people may not start businesses or they may be hampered versus international competition in terms of being able to compete! So that perhaps that is an angle, an argument there as well in terms of, There\u2019s going to be an impact on jobs and businesses on your country!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky [58:29]: I think it\u2019s a great argument! And right, it might not strike everyone as the best idea \u2014 depending on your view of government in the first place \u2014 but just as an example, Pierre Rochard put out a really interesting idea recently, which is that the US government should stop selling Bitcoin! It should start building a Bitcoin reserve! And look, that\u2019s a pretty compelling argument! And whether you want the US government to own a lot of Bitcoin or not is sort of besides the point! If you can get government to buy into the asset, then Bitcoin will sort of take care of itself on the other end, right? Bitcoin is in many ways unstoppable! So the more adoption there is, and the more approval there is, I think the more likely it is that we will end up seeing the kind of world that we think Bitcoin will usher in. There are other arguments that we have to think really hard about whether we want to make or not. One of the arguments is, really for the defense community. Which is, Bitcoin is a very effective tool of geopolitical monetary war. If you want to undermine an authoritarian or dictatorial opponent, well sanctions are fine \u2014 it\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do \u2014 but really they\u2019re not fine. I\u2019m just articulating the way you might describe this to a policy maker! Better than using sanctions and cutting a country off from the financial system, is to undermine their own currency, and the more you can promote use of Bitcoin in that society, the less powerful the dictator or authoritarian will be! Now whether we want our governments using Bitcoin as a weapon of geopolitical war we should think very carefully about. But this is just to the point that there is always an argument about how Bitcoin can be used as a tool to accomplish an objective! And I think it behooves us to figure out what those arguments are to promote the likelihood that Bitcoin will rise peacefully, at least to the extent that it can."}

What it means is you use it for as much good as you can, and you try to limit \u2014 perhaps \u2014 its use by bad actors to the extent that you can. But this is the story of every technology throughout human history! The first use of an automobile was for a bank robber to get away from the police faster, right? Like this is always what happens! The bad guys use technology first \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean we throw it away! And I do think that if you can get to that level of nuance and admit that, Yes, just like the Internet, Bitcoin is open for use by anyone. But the benefits of Bitcoin, the good that it does for the world, so far outweighs the harms that it may enable by some bad actors \u2014 because of that, we should support Bitcoin\u2019s growth and adoption, not try to hinder it!"}

Maybe then if I were to play-act as a policy maker, they might say, Well fine! You can hold your Bitcoin! But just hold it in this custodial account! And I think in their mind, they don\u2019t see the value so much as perhaps you and I do and the other Bitcoin people do, of a strict supply limit and the ability to use it in a self-sovereign way, and I guess that\u2019s really the argument we have to make!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/BiOphU3FxCM", "title": "SLP239 Jake Chervinsky \u2014 Pushing Back on FinCEN non custodial Bitcoin Regulation", "text": "Jake Chervinsky: Yeah I think that\u2019s absolutely right. And that\u2019s why I give those two examples as maybe the best arguments for Bitcoin as a tool of self-sovereignty, not just as digital gold that you can hold in a depository. That is, the ability to use it in jurisdictions where there is no financial infrastructure that is reliable using intermediaries \u2014 and that is the majority of the world! There is no reliable bank in most places where people can just hold it in custody! And the risks that centralizing all of this \u2014 not just information but value \u2014 in institutions that can be hacked, that cannot safeguard those assets. Think of Mt. Gox as an example! Every couple months we see a big exchange hack! Those are reasons why Bitcoin is much much better as a tool of self-sovereignty, as something people can hold and safeguard on their own and use on their own without relying on intermediaries, than it is as just something you can throw a few dollars in, the same way you might buy the S&P500 Index."}

So as of now, so we\u2019re recording at about 6:30PM on Monday, December 21st. The rule actually has not been published yet in the federal register, so the public comment period isn\u2019t open yet. We think that it\u2019ll be published on Wednesday, the 23rd. Once it\u2019s published, I\u2019ll make sure to put out on Twitter some advice about how to write a good public comment, just sort of a how-to of where do you go, how can you write something that\u2019s effective, write simple things like, don\u2019t just curse at the regulators and call them statists! Because that\u2019s probably not gonna help very much! So I would say, follow me on Twitter if you don\u2019t and hopefully we can all work together to share the good arguments that we can advance and we can all get as many public comments submitted as possible before the period closes. And then we\u2019ll see what we can do from there! I am very committed to making the best use of my platform as I can, so I\u2019ll make sure I can share any other ideas about how we can work together to keep Bitcoin as free as possible!"}

Let\u2019s get into the first thing, I\u2019m just kinda curious: what is the maintainer of the BTCPay-Python library do and what does that even mean? I hear Python and I think snakes. I know it\u2019s coding and you\u2019re uploading the programs but that\u2019s all I know."}

So the short story is if you are trying to build, say, an e-commerce site or something like that and you\u2019re building it in Python and you want to accept BTCPay for payments, you can make use of this library as sort of a layer that can help you communicate with your BTCPay server and automatic everything through the shopping cart and all that sort of stuff. And it would also help you track your payments, things like that. That part of BTCPay is a huge project! The Python library is just a little tiny, teeny piece of it. Not a ton of code involved in it. It just helps you, like I said, interact with BTCPay server if you\u2019ve got a Python-based application that you\u2019re running. Python\u2019s a programming language."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/ikuNgO_m16U", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #25 \u2014 Jeff Vandroux: A Post-Capitalist Future, Distributism & Bitcoin Muscle", "text": "Jeff Vandroux: I just kind of did it for the hell of it! So I didn\u2019t design the library, I picked up maintaining it and added a few things to it, because it didn\u2019t have a current maintainer at the time. So I went to school a very long time ago for computer science, actually before Python was even a language that was really in use. So I had some level of background in it from undergrad, but I never had a job as a software engineer or anything like that. I didn\u2019t end up even finishing the computer science program at school. But, when I got more into Bitcoin one of the first things I did a couple years ago is I took Justin Moon\u2019s bootcamp that he was giving at that time which was taught in Python. It was a Bitcoin-related Python coding bootcamp called BUIDL Bootcamp. I took it and one of the the things I started playing around with once I got back into coding was BTCPay \u2014 which is not a Python-based project in general\u2014it\u2019s written in C#. But I actually just looked to see if there was any way that I could help or contribute, and one of the things I did was I ended up taking over maintaining that library, because I built a Python-based plug-in for it that helped it communicate with QuickBooks. So I was making use of the Python library, and then at that point Nicholas asked me if I\u2019d be interested in taking over the maintaining the Python library. So I did! It\u2019s a small project, doesn\u2019t require a big brain to do it, which made it perfect for me! So that\u2019s how I got involved in it!"}

You\u2019ve got some big brained ideas! And we\u2019re gonna get into them momentarily. The next thing I want to talk about \u2014 so you said you went to school for computer science in undergrad. Somewhere you picked up your JD and your CPA. So I\u2019m assuming you went to law school and just picked up your CPA after that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/ikuNgO_m16U", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #25 \u2014 Jeff Vandroux: A Post-Capitalist Future, Distributism & Bitcoin Muscle", "text": "Jeff Vandroux: No not quite! So I went to night school. I worked full-time undergrad and law school. So I didn\u2019t really take school all that seriously, particularly undergrad. I was just working. Back in those days you could still make a pretty good living without a college degree, so I did I worked as a salesman. I did the computer science thing \u2014 I excelled at it, but I was like, Well, I can keep doing this computer science major while I\u2019m working, and it actually requires a decent amount of work, and there\u2019s no girls in computer science classes. Or, like I speak Spanish pretty well, so I could just major in Spanish instead, and those classes are essentially all female, and the classes aren\u2019t that difficult! So I was like, Oh! This is like a no-brainer decision! I\u2019ll just finish my degree in Spanish, so I did! That\u2019s why I got my undergraduate degree in Spanish. Then when I graduated I was like, Well, at this point I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a salesman forever, but I didn\u2019t really know what else I wanted to do. I don\u2019t know if any of you guys have done commissioned sales before, but it really grinds on you after a while! You\u2019re dealing with the public all day in kind of a high pressure situation. You\u2019re spending your entire day all day making people buy stuff. Persuading people to buy stuff. I didn\u2019t want to do that, so I just started looking for a profession where I thought I\u2019d be pretty well set. Something that required licensure so that I didn\u2019t earn a decent living that anybody could just get involved in it. And I bounced around a few different ideas. I was always kind of technical minded, so I thought maybe getting involved on the tax side might work out for me in that way, and in my little town there just happened to be a guy that happened to be both an attorney and a CPA, and I realized that that made you more unique in the marketplace, it allowed you to do more interesting stuff if you had both as opposed to just being a CPA or something like that. So I went to law school, which I also did at night. Now keep in mind at this point I\u2019d never taken an accounting class before \u2014 I had still never taken an accounting class in college. I had a bachelor\u2019s degree in Spanish and that was about it! So what I did was I went to \u2014 well the first thing I did was I taught myself accounting from a CPA exam prep book, and then I took the CPA exam and passed it. So at that point you still can\u2019t be a CPA though, because to be a CPA at least at that time in my state, you had to have a bachelor\u2019s degree, you had to have at least 150 credits, which I didn\u2019t have because you need 120 for a bachelor\u2019s degree which I didn\u2019t have yet. At least 30 of your credits had to be in accounting, and you had to work under the supervision of a CPA for at least a year like a full-time job. So what I did was \u2014 CPA exam into obtaining a full-time job at a small accounting firm where I didn\u2019t get paid very much but they were great to take me on and teach me. I don\u2019t think they even realized that my degree wasn\u2019t in accounting, because on my resume I just put that I had a bachelor\u2019s degree and I passed the CPA exam \u2014 and passing the CPA exam is kind of all that matters. So I got that job and I worked there while I went to law school at night. They were flexible and allowed me to not have to work crazy hours or anything like that so I could commute to law school at night. So I did that for a year and I had the experience requirement and now I had the 150 credits because my law school credits counted, they were still credits. But I didn\u2019t have the 30 credits in accounting. In New Jersey we have a university called Thomas Edison state college that will give you credit for your life experience, so I went to Thomas Edison state college and said, Hey, I had passed all four parts of this CPA exam on my first try, and I\u2019ve been working in public accounting for a year \u2014 will you guys give me 30 accounting credits based on that experience? And they said yes! Predominantly based on the strength of having passed the CPA exam. So I had to pay for those credits, of course, but I didn\u2019t have to actually take classes or tests for them. I had to provide proof of everything, proof that I passed the CPA exam, proof that I\u2019d been working in public accounting for a year, and they gave me 30 credits for accounting on a pass/fail basis, but they were still college credits. And they weren\u2019t from the institution where I had my bachelor\u2019s degree but that didn\u2019t matter. At that point I had all of the requirements I needed to pass my state\u2019s licensing requirements, so I did! Around that same time, I also finished law school and took the bar exam and passed that. Bar exam much, much easier than the CPA exam \u2014 not even close! CPA exam, much much much harder! At least in my state. Yeah CPA is really four different exams. You take it in four parts, it has some much bigger breadth of knowledge. Bar exam is two days. You just sit down, two days, you\u2019re down with it. At that point, I was licensed in both! I knew that I wanted to do my own thing, so I opened up my own firm right away as soon as both of my licensures were finalized. In the beginning, Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist back then, so I didn\u2019t have any focus obviously at all with regard to Bitcoin. I just had a tax firm. I did tax returns, I did tax planning work, I did a lot of estate planning work back then too. In those days the estate tax threshold was only a million dollars, so a lot of people were paying federal state tax so they needed fancier estate plans because they needed to be really tax-driven. That\u2019s not really the case anymore, estate planning is not really as tax-driven because for a married couple today, the federal state tax threshold is almost $23 million dollars. So the type of work that I used to do pretty much disappeared over the years! It just wasn\u2019t a thing that people needed anymore, for regulatory reasons. Around that same time I started to get involved with Bitcoin! Bought Bitcoin myself and I was like, Well, wouldn\u2019t it be really cool if I could buy Bitcoin for myself in a tax-advantaged way through a retirement account. So I came up with the structure \u2014 now I refer to it as The KeyKeeper IRA structure \u2014 then, it didn\u2019t even have a name. For myself, predominantly! I was like, well this is for me! And I offered it to clients as a thing around that time but nobody cared. Most people had never heard of Bitcoin, the people that had heard of Bitcoin were like, if you talked to them about taxes they thought you were a Fed. Funny story about that, I wrote an article for CoinDesk a million years ago back when it was \u2014 CoinDesk didn\u2019t even have professional journalists back then, they would accept open submissions. And it was about tax consequences of Bitcoin. Real, real basic stuff. This was back when you could just have open comments under articles. All the comments were like, Don\u2019t listen to this guy! He\u2019s a Fed! He\u2019s out to get us! That was the environment back then. So nobody really cared for several years. For the first couple of years I probably did none of these for clients. And then I was doing one or two a year. Stuff like that, for just various oddballs. Then 2017 happened, right? With the bull rally in 2017 all of a sudden there was interest in this! Bitcoin, of course, and then a lot of it was shitcoiners too, because the structure \u2014 I mean I market it for Bitcoin because that\u2019s all I care about but it works for all those shitcoins as well. There was a lot of interest in it and it started to become a bigger and bigger part of my practice! Even when the rally ended in 2017 it didn\u2019t just die off as an a practice area for me. It just has grown over time to now it\u2019s like three-quarters of what I do!"}

And that\u2019s advantageous for two reasons: (1) if you\u2019re doing it in a way that you\u2019re holding your own keys, you\u2019re sticking with the ethos of Not your keys, not your Bitcoin, and (2) if you buy GBTC, first of all, you have to be an accredited investor, and even if you are an accredited investor and you\u2019re able to buy GBTC to a regular brokerage IRA, the fees are colossal. There\u2019s like a 2% annual assets under management fee that goes to the fund manager. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s huge. So you\u2019d rather not have that giant fee eating up your returns! So the largest obstacle to being able to have this Bitcoin and hold your own keys within the auspices of a retirement account is that, under federal law, to qualify as an IRA, there has to be a third party custodian. And that third party custodian has to basically be a bank, a trust company, or this other category called a licensed non-bank custodian that gets special IRS approval. So how do we get around that? To get around that I adapted a structure that had been used for several years before this for real estate investing through an IRA. Basically the way we get around it is: we set up this custodial account for you with an appropriate financial institution, but the only asset actually owned by your IRA is either a limited liability company or a trust. The structure works both ways regardless of whether you use an LLC or a trust as that entity, but it\u2019s a state-to-state issue. Some states impose ridiculous requirements on LLCs like California does, so we use a trust in those states instead. The idea is the same. So this entity is the only asset owned by your IRA. You don\u2019t own the entity, it\u2019s owned by your IRA. However, you are the manager of the entity, in the case of an LLC, or the trustee of the entity in the case of a trust, which gives you the sole control over its assets. So any money that flows into your IRA is then immediately invested into this entity, and once it\u2019s in the entity you have control over it. So that requires \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of regulatory stuff about what has to be in the entity\u2019s operating agreement, etc. to make that work, but we handle that all for you, and then we help you get an account open on an exchange under the name and tax ID of the entity. It\u2019s very important \u2014 it can\u2019t be under your own name or social security number. You can use that account to then go ahead and buy your Bitcoin and you don\u2019t have to store it on the exchange, you can transfer it off the exchange and custody it yourself as the manager of that LLC or as trustee of that trust. You have to keep it very segregated, you can\u2019t mix it with your other non-tax advantaged Bitcoin. And that\u2019s basically, in a nutshell, how the structure works. That\u2019s how it works for most people who are not self-employed. If you\u2019re a self-employed person and you own your own business, if you don\u2019t have any full-time employees, we can actually have it such that your company 401(k), believe it or not, can hold Bitcoin, and you can hold your own keys yourself. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t quite work that way if you\u2019re self-employed and you have full-time employees. Then, the 401(k) structure isn\u2019t available to you. You\u2019re stuck with the IRA structure. But that\u2019s what I more or less spend all my time doing all day."}

And Jeff will walk you through it! I want to get into a couple other topics, because you just bring a lot to the table. Before we get into what I think is really juicy, I just want to touch on bodybuilding. You\u2019re a bodybuilder, and you\u2019re very public about it \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing it up \u2014 it\u2019s on your profile. I wonder how much of that is because of low time preference for you? And it kind of forces you to regulate or stay in a low time preference mentality? And I\u2019ve heard you speak on it on shows that you compete on it every other year, and there\u2019s a lot of dietary aspects to that to I just wanted to touch on that a bit.

I\u2019ll give you an example: when you\u2019re dieting down to get on stage for a show \u2014 and you\u2019ll see how this ties into what I\u2019m talking about with self-discipline \u2014 you\u2019re not dieting down to a healthy level of body fat, you\u2019re dieting down to a level of body fat that is absolutely not sustainable! It\u2019s not gonna hurt you to maintain that level of body fat in the short term, but that\u2019s why I generally compete like every other year. When I say every other year I might do a few shows that year, try to keep them close to each other time-wise."}

You feel horrible, you have no energy \u2014 the other point I should make is I compete in drug-tested natural bodybuilding too, it\u2019s a little bit different. Not saying there isn\u2019t a lot of self-discipline with enhanced bodybuilding\u2014enhanced is what we call non-drug tested bodybuilding \u2014 there is! It\u2019s a different type of bodybuilding. It\u2019s a different sport. But yeah, you feel terrible, and you\u2019re just not nearly as strong. You lose significant strength in getting ready for a show. I\u2019ll give you an idea: I am 190 pounds sitting here right now, and I have a six pack \u2014 it\u2019s not the most razor sharp six pack but if I took my shirt off you\u2019d definitely see all six of my abs and I would look great at the beach, right? That\u2019s at 190 pounds, I\u2019m 5'11\". If I was gonna compete, I\u2019d probably be competing at about 170, maybe the low 170s, and I would have to start losing close to 20 pounds to get on stage right now. That would take me probably about 4\u20135 months to get ready, because you can\u2019t lose that too quick \u2014 you\u2019ll lose all your muscle. So think about what an unhealthily lean level that is. Like, if I\u2019m already \u2014 what by normal stands would already be considered lean \u2014 and I\u2019d have to drop another almost 20 pounds to get on stage. It\u2019s brutal! Which is why it\u2019s mostly a self-discipline sport. Well it\u2019s genetic ability, right? A lot of stuff that I can\u2019t control. I have very, very long limbs, that\u2019s horrible for bodybuilding, because my biceps and my quads just never look as impressive because they\u2019re stretched over a longer distance. I have extremely long limbs considering I\u2019m only 5'11\" \u2014 I\u2019m not 6'8\" or something like that. But if you wanna get out there and put out your best package on stage it\u2019s a self-discipline issue, it\u2019s being able to lose all that weight and spend 4\u20135 months in a diet losing weight. When I say in a diet, I\u2019m dieting I\u2019m not eating junk, I\u2019m monitoring what I\u2019m eating all year round. It\u2019s just the sheer volume of what you\u2019re eating gets so low. I mean by the time I got on stage this most recent time, I was almost down to a thousand calories a day. And you\u2019re not doing that low of a caloric intake the whole time, you\u2019re ratcheting it down slowly over time, but it\u2019s very difficult. And the reason why \u2014 to get to your point \u2014 it\u2019s all just self-discipline. And I guess that probably on some level is a function of time-preference: being able to delay that gratification or have that level of self-discipline, to put that level of work in."}

That said, I don\u2019t really have a problem with enhanced bodybuilding at all, and steroids in general, too. To be honest, based on the research and the data that we have, if you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way, you\u2019re gonna look awesome! If you work as hard as me and you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and we have equal genetics, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re gonna look 1,000x better than me! And you\u2019re probably gonna be fine! It\u2019s probably not gonna affect your longevity or your overall health. The issue is, and I don\u2019t have a problem with these guys doing it, you can\u2019t do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and compete in enhanced bodybuilding. It\u2019s just not how it works! You have to take the drugs to a much more extreme level that probably is gonna have damage to your health. There\u2019s ways to mitigate that. There are guys out there that competed in bodybuilding and do live long lives, because even under the auspices of being more extreme, they still did it the smartest way they could, and they also were probably better genetically suited with the drugs \u2014 that\u2019s another part that no one talks about. But for me, I never went enhanced because \u2014 I wanted to be able to compete, and I didn\u2019t want to have to do the drugs in such an extreme way. And if you don\u2019t do it in an extreme way and you try and compete, you\u2019re just gonna look terrible compared to guys that do! You\u2019re just not gonna be able to compete. So for me, natural was a no-brainer for that reason. But I definitely don\u2019t have a problem with people \u2014 if you just are like recreationally lifting and you don\u2019t want to compete, and you want to do steroids, I would say, Just be smart about it, get your blood work done, do it in consultation with a doctor. I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with that at all! The only time it would really bother me, is if you\u2019re doing steroids and you\u2019re trying to sneak into one of our shows and compete with us! You have your own shows for that! Let us have our thing, let us compete \u2014 that\u2019s our thing. But other than that, I certainly don\u2019t have \u2014 I have unnamed friends that do steroids.

Just to kick off, though, you mention that each generation improves its lot as compared to the one before, but an economic system can only last as long as that\u2019s happening. So how to you frame up \u2014 you talk a lot about the 20th century and what happened there, but you use a lot of terminology like neo-liberal, globalist-capitalist, social democracy, market socialism, socialism. So if you could level-set a bit, so that we can get into some of these topics and what these words mean to you before we go further? Because it\u2019s really important to the conversation, and I think you have a really good handle on what these terms mean, at least how you\u2019re gonna conversate about them.

{"link": "https://youtu.be/ikuNgO_m16U", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #25 \u2014 Jeff Vandroux: A Post-Capitalist Future, Distributism & Bitcoin Muscle", "text": "Jeff Vandroux [31:45]: Yeah they do! And part of the issue is different people can define them differently. So for instance to a Marxist, the type of economic system that I talk about, they would still consider that capitalist. But a distributist wouldn\u2019t. So I\u2019ll just talk about the way that I define these terms, so that we could at least be consistent. Sometimes maybe I\u2019ll even draw some distinctions on how other people may define them. Capitalism to me is basically a market-based economy, more or less. And a market-based economy where competition is held to the inherently good, and where you do not want to interfere with the market itself. Like what Mises would call a hampered market. I\u2019m not including that within the definition of capitalism for purposes of what I\u2019m talking about. So, we\u2019re in right now what I would still consider a capitalist society and Libertarians would balk at that because they\u2019ll say, Oh! Well there\u2019s all these government regulations, there\u2019s all these things that affect the market! But the reason I still consider that capitalistic is because there are usually regulatory structures and other structures that are just prop up the market system itself from collapsing. They\u2019re in fact not designed to hampered the market, they\u2019re designed to keep it going at least for the benefit of the people that have the largest amount of market power, okay? That\u2019s how I would define a capitalist system. A socialist system to me is one that\u2019s based on socialized production. Meaning that you don\u2019t have private ownership of the means of production in the ways that we\u2019re used to. The workers aren\u2019t in control of the means of production and that could be through \u2014 there are a zillion different flavors of socialism, right \u2014 you could have libertarian socialists where there\u2019s not a state that\u2019s really mediating that versus a Marxist-Leninist where there is a very centralized state that\u2019s mediating that. I won\u2019t get into all those distinctions right now. But those were the two competing schools of thought more or less throughout the 20th century and even into the 21st. The 20th century specifically was defined by the conflict between capitalist and socialist production. There were other economic systems that were posited during that period that never really got too much traction. Social democracy to me \u2014 which really did take off in the latter half of the 20th century \u2014 was more or less an attempt to prop up the capitalist system through transfers. The workers don\u2019t really have power in most social democratic systems that we see today. They\u2019re just thrown tax transfer payments and stuff like that just to keep the system going, to prevent them from starving, creating trouble, revolting, things of that nature. And if you take that out far enough, social democracy and things like that, what will start happening is \u2014 and this is what I think we\u2019re seeing right now \u2014 we\u2019re seeing a system where over time what happens is capital always seems to centralize. That seems to be the natural thing \u2014 if you have a market, eventually someone\u2019s gonna win in that market. And when they win and they put their competitors out of business, their accumulation of capital is going to accelerate. We\u2019ve seen this many times throughout history. And once capital fully accelerates to the point where we just say \u2014 say you have a small oligarchy of players that own all the capital in a given market \u2014 that\u2019s when you end up at something that Hillaire Belloc would have called the servile state. And in the servile state you have a small oligarchy that controls all the means of production, and they actually voluntarily throw benefits \u2014 they could be government benefits or private benefits, that distinction is useless for reasons we can talk about \u2014"}

So let me be clear about that \u2014 but, the type of Marxism that\u2019s taught in the university system in the United States really isn\u2019t based on Marx\u2019s ideas, it\u2019s more based on ideas that came later during the mid to late 20th century that claimed to be intellectual successors to Marx.

People say it\u2019s a conspiracy theory but this is well documented \u2014 were funded by the CIA.

And that has become the dominant flavor of Marxism in the West that\u2019s taught in universities, etc. And that\u2019s what people generally believe when they say, Hey I\u2019m a Marxist. If you go back and actually read Marx\u2019s work, what\u2019s interesting about it is a couple things: (1) it has really nothing to do with any of that stuff. Marx\u2019s work is not even really about socialism. Marx\u2019s work is about capitalism. It\u2019s a description and a critique of capitalism is essentially what it is. It specifically really goes into the contradictions inherent within capitalism."}

The point I was trying to make is, he also died while he was still writing so we don\u2019t really know what he would have come up with if he had lived longer. His point was more so that \u2014 and I disagree with him on this point \u2014 that socialism, meaning a socialized means of production, was essentially inevitable due to all of these inherent contradictions within capitalism that he described. Some of which line up with the contradictions that I mentioned in my writing. Others of which don\u2019t. I don\u2019t agree with him that that made socialism inevitable because I think that the servile state is an alternative that the holders of capital would obviously strongly prefer and I do think is workable, unfortunately! I would wish it weren\u2019t workable but I do think that that is a workable system. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s right about that, but his critiques of capitalism are very interesting. And you\u2019re right, if you actually went back and read Das Kapital or you read The Communist Manifesto or any of his other writings, it really wouldn\u2019t line up with what people that are ranting and raving on the Internet about being Marxist are talking about today. So the point where this whole conversation started was: there are really two groups of people that are pointing out what you just said, that a lot of these things like the UBI are really in full alignment with the largest holders of capital. The first group is the anti-capitalist right, which is a growing faction of people at least on the Internet and the intelligentsia. And they might not even necessarily always call themselves anti-capitalist, they\u2019re just not free market people."}

On some level I\u2019m probably part of that philosophically and ideologically. Because I am conservative. And (1) that\u2019s just a group of people \u2014 and they may not even all fully consider themselves anti-capitalist, but they\u2019re people that say, Hey if we want to have what we consider from a right-wing perspective to be a beneficial society, a free and unfettered market is not a way that we can do that. And there\u2019s a lot of different schools of thought. If you want to really dig into that world, American Affairs is a fantastic quarterly publication that I would put in that category. And they have a very broad breadth of thought, people that consider themselves anti-capitalist versus capitalist reformist, those things probably in practice aren\u2019t really all that different. And they even have some socialist writers sometimes. But American Affairs is a right-wing publication. But definitely not a free markets publication! That is not American Affairs\u2019 perspective. And that\u2019s been around for a few years and it\u2019s been growing like crazy. A lot of good intellectual energy behind it. So that\u2019s one group of people that you\u2019ll see making that exact same connection that you\u2019re making. And that\u2019s starting to bleed over into mainstream politics just a tiny teensy teensy teensy little bit. You will hear Josh Hawley for instance say a watered down version of things that you might read in American Affairs. You\u2019ll see Tom Cotton say a very watered down version of things you might see in American Affairs. So they\u2019re not really there, but you can see where this is going. The (2) other group of people are the people that still stick to the old religion Marxism. I don\u2019t want to get into terminology fights because a lot of them will quibble with what I\u2019m about to say. A lot of those people are now referring to themselves as post-leftists to distinguish themselves from the mainstream left. Some people don\u2019t like that term. Some of them prefer to be called left populists. Those are the two groups of people that you really see doing that. If you want to get a good flavor of some of that thought \u2014 and again it\u2019s a very broad area of thought, not all of them are going to agree, many of them would even disagree with the way I\u2019m categorizing them \u2014 you want to read something like The Bellows, which is an online publication which is really great, really fantastic! What\u2019s Left is a really great podcast that\u2019s of that general genre. My friends \u2014 who I was actually just livestreaming with before I came onto this podcast \u2014 the Good Ol Boys kind of do a fusion. I don\u2019t know if they would describe it this way but they do a fusion of those two camps that I talked about. People that are on the right and the people that are in that post-left area, they straddle those two and do a synthesis of those two. For listeners that want to get a better idea of that school of thought that\u2019s out there and developing, those are some resources that you can look at."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/ikuNgO_m16U", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #25 \u2014 Jeff Vandroux: A Post-Capitalist Future, Distributism & Bitcoin Muscle", "text": "Jeff Vandroux: In early capitalism \u2014 when I say early capitalism I\u2019m talking post-industrial revolution up until before the New Deal \u2014 you had a competitive market. Distributists, which Belloc and Chesterton are probably most famous, have this concept called the capitalist paradox. It basically means when you have this free market going on \u2014 and I\u2019m not adapting this to the modern day, they wrote over a hundred years ago \u2014 the way you would apply the capitalist paradox to more modern ideas and even in their times was: if you\u2019ve got this competitive market, your goal is to be the last one standing. You\u2019re constantly competing. And the way you want to do that is by cutting costs. If you can offer an equivalent good or service and you can offer it cheaper, you\u2019re gonna win. So what\u2019s the easiest way to cut your costs? It\u2019s just to pay your employees less! It\u2019s like a no-brainer. Typically in a market you wanna pay your employees as low as possible while still getting them to show up to work and do their job appropriately, right? So what\u2019s the problem with that? If everybody keeps cutting their employees\u2019 pay to try to compete with each other, eventually you\u2019re gonna get to the point where the employee class or the working class, they\u2019re just subsisting. They\u2019re able to like feed themselves and clothe themselves and get to work, and that\u2019s about it. They\u2019re not gonna be able to buy your stuff! And that\u2019s a problem, because if capital is concentrated such that let\u2019s say only five people have it, well those five people only need so many shoes, no matter how luxurious their lifestyle might be. But if that capital is spread across five million people, they\u2019re gonna buy a lot more shoes! So the paradox is that by trying to get ahead you end up impoverishing all of your customers and they can\u2019t buy your stuff anymore. That\u2019s in a nutshell a very simplified version of the capitalist paradox. So the system \u2014 and when I say the system that can be a governmental system or a non-governmental system, it doesn\u2019t really matter because in a capitalist society a governmental system is gonna be run by the larger holders of capital so they can collude privately or they can collude publicly via government, the government is just a collusion mechanism \u2014 they are gonna have to find a way to funnel stuff back to the working classes so that they can keep buying things. The initial way that that was done early on was through charity. You were a really rich guy, a Carnegie or a Rockefeller, you would have all these charitable endeavors. And these charitable endeavors that were meant to help the poor, what they were really doing was just sort of recirculating capital back downwards to keep the system going. You had to find a way to constantly recirculate that capital downwards. And that charity stuff lasted for a while, but the problem was there\u2019s not a formal mechanism to make sure that all my other rich friends are giving as much to charity as I am. That can work for a while but eventually that\u2019s going to break down. It\u2019s not sufficient anymore to recycle that capital back down to the working classes. So what we did next was the mid-century era which was the New Deal in the United States and other similar social democracy programs in Europe. What they did was they actually implemented formalized systems through the government. Systems like social security \u2014 which I\u2019m not even opposed to social security \u2014 but that was the point of it. That was the motivation behind it. Just welfare! Stuff like food stamps, general welfare payments, all that stuff really took off in the mid-20th century. That was the idea behind it. That was the mechanism to recycle that down. And that worked really well for a while, particularly because during that era you had two things going on. You had that welfare system, but you also actually had systems to gain workers more power like unionization that also came about in that era. But what happened after: the power systems for workers broke down first, and then eventually the welfare re-circulation systems broke down. There was welfare reform in the 90s, a lot of those benefits started to get cut! At the same time, you had off-shoring going on so people\u2019s wages went down even further. So that welfare system remained in place to some extent but it wasn\u2019t cutting it anymore. Not enough capital was getting re-circulated down. So what happened in the phase that started from the 90s to the phase we\u2019re still in today, and that\u2019s the usury system where you just lend it to them! These people are basically living on a borrowed lifestyle, right? We\u2019re a debt-based society! So that\u2019s another way you can funnel capital back down to them and then they are able to then use that. They\u2019re not obviously using it as capital, investing it. They\u2019re just using it to spend to live or on consumable items. So that\u2019s the other way to do it. And the usury system is really advantageous to them because they get to charge interest, right? So not only do they make money on selling you stuff, but they make money on the fact that they gave you money to buy it to begin with! So money is being made at all angles there when you\u2019re dealing with a usury system. [57:13] And I should point out here that usury\u2014I\u2019m using Hillaire Belloc\u2019s definition of the term. Usury nowadays we define as charging an amount of interest that\u2019s so high that it\u2019s unethical or illegal. But that\u2019s not what it meant in the distributist tradition. It essentially meant any loan that was for a consumable asset. So a mortgage would not have necessarily \u2014"}

When I fail it\u2019s my fault. That sort of thinking is gonna get you far in life on a personal level. It also is an insane way to run a government! In that you\u2019re just gonna have a situation where you\u2019re gonna have a few winners that come out dominating everyone else.

I\u2019ll let you know what I\u2019ve gathered from it because I listen to you on other podcasts and I ran home and I told my wife about it. And the way I frame it up is, We\u2019re gonna distribute economic ownership \u2014 maybe not property ownership \u2014 throughout the population. And I use the example of Amazon. Amazon gets so big! So once it achieves a certain size \u2014 I don\u2019t know how we determine that size \u2014but you\u2019re like, Okay, we need to have 20% of the employees represented on the board of directors. In that scenario and I\u2019m paraphrasing you, now we\u2019re not gonna have 2-day delivery because I\u2019m not gonna piss and shit in my pants, I\u2019m not gonna wear diapers as an employee, so we\u2019re gonna be on a 4-day delivery. Everyone\u2019s not gonna get what they want, or the most supreme service, but we\u2019re gonna balance by not having people wearing diapers in a factory or old people commuting to the best jobs around the country to work in Amazon factories \u2014 whatever it is! How do I build it out more than that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/ikuNgO_m16U", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #25 \u2014 Jeff Vandroux: A Post-Capitalist Future, Distributism & Bitcoin Muscle", "text": "Jeff Vandroux [1:04:37]: Yeah, sure! So, distributism is primarily just an ideal. Meaning, saying that you respect private property so that\u2019s where it makes it a little bit different from a communist for instance. You very much respect private property, but you wanna use the legal system to corral the market such that private property remains very widely distributed. And that capital itself maintains wide distribution, which a free market\u2019s not gonna provide that. So you need a system in place to hamper the market, essentially so that such a thing can happen! And distributists throughout the hundred-year history of it have had a lot of different ideas about the best the way to do that. So it\u2019s hard to say, Oh this is a distributist policy over versus this isn\u2019t. I can tell you the ones that I think are good ideas, but many people that call themselves distributists would disagree very much with my ideas, because it\u2019s moreso an ideal that\u2019s never been fully implemented. So from my perspective, what might that look like in the real world? I\u2019m gonna answer that first into things you could actually do within the next 30 years that are marginally realistic, and then we could talk about pie in the sky stuff, right? Those are two different aspects that we can look at. When we\u2019re talking about this, first of all it\u2019s important to understand the concept of subsidiarity which is different from pure decentralization. Subsidiarity means power is exercised at the lowest level in which it can be effectively exercised. Not the lowest level altogether! Because if you fully decentralize things, what usually ends up happening is the strongest guy in this little decentralized world will essentially end up dominating everybody else and you\u2019ll end right up back in a centralized system! A free market is decentralized at the beginning, and that\u2019s what happens! Subsidiarity says, You push just enough power up the different levels of government such that everybody is still getting a piece. That\u2019s the idea behind this system. Everybody gets a little piece of what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to keep that higher level of authority running such that everybody\u2019s still getting their piece, and no one can dominate that higher level of government. That\u2019s easier said than done! But I\u2019ll give you some examples of things that would move a little bit closer to a distributist ideal but are still somewhat realistic. Number one would be, as you said \u2014 first of all tax and regulatory policy that favors non-public small family businesses over large publically traded businesses. And that\u2019s just a value judgment. So if you\u2019re a libertarian and you\u2019re hearing that, that sounds insane! No, I\u2019m actually saying the legal system should discriminate against businesses that are held that way, and in favor of the smaller ones even if they are less efficient, to a degree that\u2019s acceptable. There are some businesses like a utility company can\u2019t necessarily operate that way. But your tax and regulatory structure in fact benefits directly those types of businesses. When you\u2019re talking about larger businesses that really can\u2019t operate that way \u2014 let me give concrete examples. Restaurants would be a good example of that! There is no benefit to having a Chili\u2019s on every corner versus family restaurants in every town. There just isn\u2019t, that\u2019s stupid! On the other end of the spectrum, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily want a different cell phone company in every town. That would be difficult, just the nature of that industry. So when you\u2019re talking about those industries that don\u2019t lend themselves to that, those industries just have to be very regulated, and there\u2019s a variety of different ways that you can do that. You mentioned one where those industries are gonna have to give their workers seats on the board. Because that is a form of distributed control, even if it\u2019s not \u2014 ideally you would want companies like that to be co-ops. That\u2019s the ideal. Co-ops are essentially a business where the workers own it. It\u2019s not socialism because there\u2019s still a market in play. We don\u2019t all in a society own AT&T, but AT&T\u2019s employees own AT&T, T-Mobile\u2019s employees own T-Mobile, but it\u2019s still run like a corporation. They elect a board of directors and there\u2019s still a president. And this is a business model that does exist! Mondragon is an industrial cooperative, a very large one in Spain, that operates that way: their employees own the business. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets paid the same. The janitor doesn\u2019t get paid the same as the CEO does. But there are ways to make that work. That\u2019s the ideal, but it would be really hard to transition to that system right away, or anytime in the near future. In the meantime, what Germans call the co-determination system because they do this in their country, is a step in the right direction, is the best that we could do right now. And that system says: once your company is over a certain size \u2014 and that\u2019s an arbitrary line \u2014 your employees are gonna elect a board of directors. You\u2019re not gonna operate solely for your shareholders anymore. Your employees are gonna have a seat at this table, they\u2019re gonna have actual agency over their jobs and what they do everyday. That\u2019s a baby-step in that direction when we can\u2019t get to that co-op level. Something that I\u2019ve been sold on too is a move more towards corporatist government, corporatist in the tripartite tradition. And if you wanna learn more about that American Affairs maybe two issues ago, Michael Lind wrote an article about tripartite corporatism. It\u2019s ironic that I\u2019m citing him because he\u2019s not a distributist, he actually likes very centralized businesses. But tripartite corporatism is not limited to that sort of a system. A tripartite corporatist system is one where \u2014 right now administrative agencies that set regulations for our business environment are just staffed by career bureaucrats. That\u2019s how it works. In a corporatist system, it wouldn\u2019t work that way! Let\u2019s say the division of the agency that is controlling wireless telecommunication \u2014 instead of being staffed by bureaucrats what would happen is the government would legally sanction and recognize a union that represented all of the telecommunications workers. The workers actually would not be required to join the union. If they don\u2019t want to pay dues \u2014 France does this by the way, it\u2019s not a pie in the sky thing \u2014 they don\u2019t have to join the union. If they don\u2019t want to pay dues, they don\u2019t get to vote. The union allows elections but they don\u2019t have to join! [1:13:06] This union is sanctioned by the government, and then the employers would have their own industry association also sanctioned by the government. And then consumers in that particular industry would also have an organization sanctioned by the government. I\u2019m describing it a little bit differently than Lind does, but it\u2019s the same general idea as Lind envisions this. And those three entities, all who have competing interests, would sit down at the table and hammer out the regulatory structure that is best for the three of them! Instead of the bureaucrat that is detached from the consequences of his actions, right? So the union is obviously incentivized to hammer out the best deal for the employees. The employers association is incentivized to hammer out the best deal in the regulatory environment for the employer. Now if you had just those two, they might agree to screw consumers, right? So that\u2019s the third leg of the stool here in terms of who are actually coming up with the regulatory environments for these businesses. And they hammer out a regulatory environment that works for all three of them! And it\u2019s an everybody gets a piece system. It\u2019s actually fundamentally a patronage system! Where everybody\u2019s just looking out for their own interests and using the government to patronize themselves. But because you have competing interests that are opposed to one another, everybody\u2019s competing to make sure they still get their piece. Everybody gets a piece! That\u2019s the overarching thing here."}

We have not been on such a path for some time which just means that the debt is growing much faster than the economy. This is not the time to act on those concerns!

Back in January, when I started tweeting about this at the end of January\u2014maybe at the beginning of February when it actually came out \u2014 with Eric Townsend, I mean we were laying into this saying this was gonna be a really big deal. And dude, we got so much \u2014 I mean everyone was furious! I mean furious! I had people just \u2014 you just can\u2019t imagine the feedback we were getting! Saying, You\u2019re an alarmist! Nothing\u2019s even happened! Oh that\u2019s only in a small town in China, and this and that. I mean I was just watching the video feeds out of China, in Wuhan in particular, which is a town that\u2019s bigger than New York City. And people just have to put that in perspective. This is a town that\u2019s bigger than New York City! And the firsthand account videos that were slipping out underneath of the firewall were crazy! Just total madness! You know, in the military, they send you through biochem exercises. They\u2019ll take you, they\u2019ll throw you in a tent, it\u2019s got CS gas inside there, they\u2019ll take, Take off your mask. And you gotta breathe this CS gas in. You\u2019ve got all this snot, everything is just coming out of your nose, because what it is effectively is like really fine shards of glass that you\u2019re breathing in when you\u2019re breathing in CS gas. So I\u2019ve been through these types of exercises. I\u2019ve done that in the military, and let me tell you, I know exactly what it looks like. And everything that I was seeing coming out of China was that! It was these kinds of exercises! [05:37] So whenever I saw everybody geared up in that type of equipment, in this \u2014 they call it Mopp level 4 or 5 or whatever that they were wearing over t here\u2014 to me I was saying, This is really bad! And if this goes where I think this is gonna go\u2014and you were looking at the supply chains just completely shutting down in China \u2014 this is gonna be really bad! So early on I was very concerned about this! Now that it\u2019s here in the States, do I think that every single state should be shut down in the way that they\u2019re shut down based on the amount of the cases that are there? Another reference to the military \u2014 they say, Distribute the authority to the lowest level possible, let those people make informed decisions. And what you\u2019re gonna find is that you perform the best that way! So I think when you look at how it\u2019s being handled here in the U.S., I think New York has major issues in the hospitals. They\u2019ve gotta push that \u2014 I mean because it all comes down to your bottleneck, which is at the hospitals right? Their hospitals are at max capacity, they\u2019re having all sorts of issues. So in that area it\u2019s terrible! You go to other parts of the country it\u2019s not bad at all, so why are these people not having the ability to work? And I think it really needs to be governed by the governors of each of these states, then it needs to be pushed down to the local communities as to how they\u2019re dealing with it. And I think if they just took that approach they might find that maybe the impact to the economy wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bad. Is that what you\u2019re getting at with your question?"}

South by Southwest 2014 I think was the first time that he was first publicly speaking about Bitcoin. It\u2019s at least what I grabbed for the Nakamoto Institute skeptics page. He was saying run of the mill stuff like, Oh it\u2019s great technology but at the time he was saying it was like baseball cards. Like, It\u2019s not gonna work as a currency. He\u2019s making these really lame tired statements about Bitcoin. I was getting into it on Twitter with him then and I even offered to meet up with him \u2014 I was down the street from downtown at the time. He didn\u2019t take me up but we got into this fight on Twitter. And then a year later I was at a steakhouse during South by Southwest in 2015 and I\u2019m outside and a mutual friend of Pierre and myself spotted Mark Cuban standing outside the same steakhouse. He was just like, Hey look! It\u2019s Mark Cuban! You should go get him! Or whatever. And I just turn around and was like, Yeah! There\u2019s Mark Cuban!\u2014"}

So I tell him, I won and I launch into a whole rant about Bitcoin and why he was wrong with his analysis and stuff. Well a lot of people would hear that and probably think, What a dweeb\u2014not being able to shut up about Bitcoin. It\u2019s true! But at the same time Mark Cuban was actually quite interested in the discussion! We ended up having quite a long discussion, it was like 15 minutes standing outside going back and forth. But he was taking positions like, The Federal Reserve is doing a great job, and we don\u2019t even really need to replace it. And Bitcoin can\u2019t replace it anyway. The real thing is blockchain technology, yadda yadda yadda. He ended up giving me his e-mail address to follow up, but by the time I got around to getting over the fact that I was accosting billionaires in the street and getting their e-mails for telling them they\u2019re wrong, it dawned on me that, Eh! I\u2019m a broke college kid! I really don\u2019t need a billionaire buying the Bitcoins that I wish that I could buy! So because of that I never even e-mailed him! But the years go on and he pops out and continues to say stupid things. And it\u2019s in this really annoying fashion! Because he does give lip service to the technology! He says like, Oh! The blockchain technology! At the time in 2014 he was pumping Cyberdust or something, and it was some chat app based on the blockchain, and we\u2019re supposed to take that seriously. I can even imagine him trying to paint himself as not really being anti-Bitcoin, but he\u2019s such a normie about it, it\u2019s disgusting! I finally made use of his e-mail back in September where I sent him a long e-mail talking about stock to flow and saying, Look, we can see Bitcoin be $100,000 by December 2021 and I left it at that. He actually responded quickly, I sent an even better response to him, never heard back from that of course. But I just needed an on-the-record, like, Remember who told you! I just always want to dangle that over him because that\u2019s just how it is. Also, he owns the Mavericks and I\u2019m originally from San Antonio, so he was just unacceptable on all fronts!"}

Because \u2014 in my very humble opinion \u2014 there\u2019s a very obvious flaw in his thinking. Viewing this narrative \u2014 this is the Cuban paradox. It\u2019s this idea \u2014 and it goes back to the Twitter war I had with him I don\u2019t know how long ago. But his comment all revolved around this idea that he allowed people to pay in his stadium with Bitcoin. And at the end of the first year he had like $600 of people that paid to go to his game with Bitcoin. So his deduction at that point is, Nobody\u2019s using this! And therefore it\u2019s never gonna catch on! And therefore the price will never go up! And that\u2019s his thesis. And I think for anybody who \u2014 I guess this is me throwing him a bone and like empathizing with his position because I think for most people that are just at the micro-level, they\u2019re at, Hey I own this billion-dollar company or I own this $500 million dollar company or I own this $1 million dollar company. The only thing that really processes in their brain is this, Well if you don\u2019t have people using it and there\u2019s no utility well then the price is never gonna go up, there\u2019s no one that\u2019s going to bid the price up higher, and then that\u2019s the end of their analysis. But I think on this one there\u2019s a very deep fundamental flaw in that thinking, because they\u2019re not understanding what it\u2019s trying to achieve at its most root and intrinsic level. And so what I would tell you \u2014 in my humble opinion \u2014 what it\u2019s solving is it\u2019s pegging global central banks. All of them \u2014 it\u2019s pegging them. It\u2019s literally pinning them to a wall, and saying, There\u2019s not gonna be any more of that! And if there is, you\u2019re gonna be held accountable to it! That\u2019s what this is all about! That is Mission One! If you\u2019re gonna list out all the missions on a piece of paper, Mission One cannot be triumphed by anything else! You cannot put the idea of, All these people in third world countries paying with Bitcoin above it first pegging global fiat money that these global central bankers continue to debase \u2014"}

That mission has to be accomplished \u2014 no matter what \u2014 before anything else can take place! So if you don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s important\u2014which I would argue, tons of people do not understand why that\u2019s important because when you dig into it it\u2019s really complex as why that has to happen \u2014 I have been promoting the living hell out of this book, but I\u2019m gonna do it right now, but that\u2019s why people need to read this flipping book: this book is called The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth. And when you read this book you\u2019ll gain an understanding as to why Mission One has to be accomplished first and foremost before anything else. You can\u2019t compromise on that! At all! If you compromise on that, there\u2019s gonna be some other protocol that\u2019s gonna rise up and be more important. [18:04] So when you look at, Well why does Bitcoin accomplish that over everything else, you can get into a lot of the reasons why, but if I was gonna summarize real quickly: Bitcoin just annihilates all the competition! And so going back to the Cuban paradox: the idea is, Well, if people aren\u2019t using it in my stadium and if there\u2019s no utility for people to use it then how in the world is the price gonna go up? Well I\u2019ll tell you how the price is gonna go up. We\u2019ve got this quantitative hardening happening here in May: the halvening, right? So these miners that are gonna mine the living hell out of this. Look at how much hashing is coming online in this two-week adjustment that we\u2019re at right now. We\u2019re over 10% leading into this thing, and the price has been, not spectacular. I mean it took the big hit, it had a significant bounce, but the price has just been kinda hanging around. So you have to ask yourself: Why in the hell are all these people bringing more rigs online to the tune of 10% of the entire network on this two-week difficulty adjustment that we have. What is it that they know that no one else understands? Well here\u2019s what they understand, is that as soon as that halving event happens, all these people that are spooling up these S17 mining rigs\u2014guess what? They\u2019ve got huge margins! Massive margins! And guess what? They don\u2019t have to sell! They do not have to sell even after you take that reward and you cut it in half! You\u2019re pumping out half as much reward and guess what? They\u2019re still in the money! [19:48] They still got margin! And they\u2019re gonna continue to mine. They\u2019re gonna mine the living crap out of it! And not only are they gonna mine it, but they\u2019re gonna sell less in order to offset and pay for their electrical bills than the people running the S9s that dropped out of the market beforehand. And guess what that does to the price? It drives it higher! Okay so everybody who heard me say that, what pops into their head is they say \u2014 the argument that I constantly hear whenever you spew that narrative that I just spewed \u2014 they say, Well, when you look at how much the miners are selling on the market, it\u2019s a pittance compared to the overall transactions for the whole network. That\u2019s what you hear! Well guess what? You\u2019re using the wrong ratio when you\u2019re talking about that! The real ratio you need to talk about is, How much are those miners putting onto the market to sell to recoup their electrical costs versus the amount of fiat that\u2019s coming in versus the amount of BTC in people that are leaving that network? That net difference between the people coming and the people going is in the denominator of that ratio. Not the total transactions. And so when you change that denominator to the thing that actually matters, which is the net difference between people coming and going out of the network, all of a sudden you have a very big number relative to the amount of selling that\u2019s taking place to the miners. Which therefore means, they\u2019re driving that floor in the price! And I can\u2019t tell you how many people miss that. People do not understand that, at all! That\u2019s my opinion as to why this event that\u2019s getting ready to happen in May \u2014 and it might take a month, it might take two months for the gears to really click and to ratchet in, but when they do, the thing just takes off! Because the miners that are inefficient are completely out of the game at that point. That flow is not being sold into the market like it was before."}

And you see that percentage increasing! That to me is a better way of thinking about the demand side than when people look at like the exchange trade volume, and they say, Oh okay, well Bitcoin mining is a tiny percentage of exchange trade volume \u2014 the trading going on. Whereas to me the Unchained Capital HODL waves of people withdrawing from the exchange and putting it on their cold storage, that is real demand! That is the reservation demand for cash."}

But for me, that\u2019s the only thing that I can think of that makes sense, and why you consistently see this floor being set. When you plot this price chart on a logarithmic scale since the inception of Bitcoin, why in the hell does it plot so perfectly in mathematical terms as far as the curve that you see? The only thing that I can come to the conclusion is, is that these miners are setting the floor. And the floor is completely based on that flow that\u2019s being dropped into the market."}

Because the thing that\u2019s driving it is not necessarily the utility at sporting events or at coffee stores or any of this stuff! The thing that\u2019s driving it \u2014 going back to what I described earlier \u2014 you have these miners that are running new equipment that have huge margins that accept this reduction in the amount of coins that they\u2019re mining, and so they\u2019re selling less back into the market and then the price starts going up because you don\u2019t have as much selling pressure. So now once it starts taking off, guess what? All these speculators then step into the market! And then it becomes a speculative thing at that point. So where that transition occurs \u2014 I have no freaking clue! I have no idea where that transition occurs! But it\u2019s just human psychology! It\u2019s just how humans react when they start seeing the price go up and you\u2019ve got every freaking person on the street walking up to you and saying, Hey! You know something about Bitcoin doncha? Right? That\u2019s when you know that the speculators are in the game! Is when that starts happening! When you start getting the e-mails from people that you haven\u2019t talked to in 15 years and they\u2019re like, Hey dude! How\u2019s it going? Right? You know that the mining is not driving the price at that point! The speculators, the people that want a quick turn, a quick buck, the people that have no clue how any of this works, but they just want to make a quick buck! And that drives the cycle for a significant period of time! I have no idea how long! But it drives it from that point.

Which I think has been the right way to look at it for the past decade. But we haven\u2019t seen Bitcoin go through a financial crisis yet! And there\u2019s been speculation that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, it\u2019s basically just like the tech-Tamagotchi thing that \u2014 if there\u2019s a liquidity crisis in the system \u2014 then Bitcoin\u2019s gonna crash. That I think has been reflected by its correlation with the S&P500 since the start of the real reaction to COVID-19 and the financial markets. But I actually think that if you look at, for example, the Sharpe ratio for a 4-year holding period: the Sharpe ratio for stocks has crashed! Whereas the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t really moved very much at all. That to me is like, There is in fact a disconnect here, and Bitcoin is actually proving to be a better store of value even if the short-term people on Twitter can\u2019t really see it that way. And that it did bounce back so quickly after the March 12th liquidation that went down to like $3,600. The leverage in the Bitcoin system had already been wiped out in December of 2018. And then it kind of got rebuilt April to July of 2019. Then it got wiped out again March 12th. But now at $7,000 and holding steady, it feels like Bitcoin is undervalued, while stocks are still overvalued! [29:42]"}

Just because \u2014 now that they\u2019re not just using QE, which was the primary means of insertion for the last decade, now they\u2019re using UBI! And now they\u2019re gonna have to coordinate both of those together. I was always of the opinion this was gonna happen! This was just a matter of when it\u2019d happen. I would have that conversation with some people when I told them, Hey! Even if Trump would be re-elected, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least bit that UBI would become a thing! And people would look at me and they\u2019d say, You are off your rocker! You are nuts! I said, It\u2019s just a function of the math, man! There\u2019s only so much you can insert into the markets and everything that\u2019s happening, because your typical person is looking at this and saying, Oh! Well this is just because of that virus that all this is happening! Whereas, Dude \u2014 this has been in the works for decades! For just flipping decades! So now it comes down to \u2014 I mean, look at the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ\u2019s booming! I mean it has a Bitcoin-like bounce to it! I think people that are looking at this and saying this is gonna be a Great Depression-like scenario, I think they\u2019re forgetting that when you look at the charts from \u2014 and it absolutely could be that, so please don\u2019t take this comment as me waiving that, that it couldn\u2019t happen \u2014 I just think that the range of potential outcomes is much wider as to what we might see moving forward. When you go back to 1929, you didn\u2019t come off the gold standard until 1933. So you had this peg in place through that downturn, that 3-year, 4-year grind from 1929 to 1933, and during that entire period of time you were working with a pegged currency. You don\u2019t have that right now! Not only do you not have it in the US, you don\u2019t have it anywhere! [32:30] So that\u2019s where I think people that are immediately going to an analogous comparison to that, I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re necessarily widening their aperture far enough! I think it\u2019s wider than that! And the fact that they\u2019re throwing as much money as they\u2019re throwing at this, and \u2014 I hate talking politics, because I am politics agnostic, 100% \u2014 I don\u2019t think you can be successful in the markets unless you\u2019re politics agnostic. I prefaced that before I say this: When you look at how Trump\u2019s gonna respond to this, I think he\u2019s gonna respond to this with literally everything he can possibly throw at it, times 10! And so if that\u2019s a true statement, I mean, you could see people out of the labor market, highest unemployment numbers you\u2019ve ever seen in your life, and I think you could see the market come back to numbers that you saw before any of this happened, even with people out of work! And I don\u2019t think anybody is pricing that potential in! And I think that that is a potential! I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a high potential, but I think it\u2019s a potential. So what does that mean? And this is going off of what Pierre was saying earlier: this means crazy volatility! So if you\u2019re looking at risk-adjusted returns compared to that volatility \u2014 yeah! You should see the Sharpe ratio for the stock market get crushed! Right? Because not only are you not making any real returns from where this thing started, but now you\u2019re clocking in this massive amount of volatility, and no one knows where the hell it\u2019s going next! It\u2019s completely dependent on government intervention! I mean it has been for the last ten years whether people want to believe that or not! That\u2019s just a fact. I\u2019m not trying to be tinfoil anything, it\u2019s just a pure fact that when you pump that much QE into the system, you haven\u2019t let up since 2009, you go clear up to the brink where everything falls apart, and then you\u2019re not only doing QE but then you\u2019re doing UBI to the tune of $2,000 a month until unemployment goes back to the lowest levels we ever saw since the 1950's-1960's \u2014 is how long they\u2019re saying they would keep that on \u2014 this stuff is crazy! This is total, absolute, unprecedented debasement at the nth degree that will literally make people\u2019s minds explode! Like that\u2019s how much debasement we\u2019re talking about!"}

In an Austrian economics system, where you have a deflationary money, people would be holding much higher real cash balances.

The thing that no one talks about is when you have an inflationary monetary policy which we\u2019ve had for eons, basically since Bretton-Woods. Even when we were on a gold standard from 1944 up until 1971, I would aggressively argue that you were on an inflationary monetary policy because of the debasement that took place through the money multiplier against the gold that was sitting in the reserves. That\u2019s a whole other conversation. So if we buy that argument that we\u2019ve been in this inflationary monetary policy since 1944, well what happens is you set up this incentive structure around that inflationary monetary policy. And when you have that incentive structure set in place for that long, you get the craziness, especially at the tail end of this thing, which is exactly where we\u2019re at right now, you have this incentive structures that are not pointing towards each other and that are self-reinforcing, but now that are actually the opposite way and they\u2019re self-ripping apart of each other!

I have this meta-feeling towards history where considering how much of politics has always been about getting your hands on control of the money. I know there\u2019s the classic Rothchild quote about, Give me control of the money and I care not who makes the laws. But Nick Szabo had a great set of Tweets once about, All of the wars that were really just plundering gold vaults. You go forward to the 19th century and people don\u2019t talk about this much but one of the pillars in the Communist Manifesto was literally full state control of banking and credit because they wanted to do things like what we see today! And a lot of these sort of battles of political ideologies in the 20th century were also \u2014 as far as I can tell \u2014 almost like trying to control the banking system, the money underneath that. In today\u2019s world you\u2019re going to want to have control of that and keep doing whatever you need for this thing to survive, and anything that goes against what you\u2019re saying is going to put a halt to this system, so you\u2019re gonna keep doubling down on that power unless you see that alternative, which is why it\u2019s so embarrassing to see people like Thomas Massey, who\u2019s actually usually like a great defender of freedom and stuff, but it\u2019s embarrassing to take that frame of trying to stand athwart fiat money saying, Stop! Instead you need to just look for the next gold vault, the next monetary system, so that you can just exit altogether! And that\u2019s what Bitcoin\u2019s for!"}

Get them away from me! Now you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s very different. Which is: with universal basic income and everybody receiving a paycheck of $2,000 a month until we get back down to the unemployment numbers from 1960, people are starting to say, How is that possible? Huh? Uh, how are they doing that? And how can that last? Um, how is that possible? How does that not have some type of impact? And so their guard is up and they\u2019re saying, This could be bad, but so far it doesn\u2019t seem like it is! So when that guard goes up they\u2019re looking for, Where could this go bad? Where is something that just doesn\u2019t make sense? And then all of a sudden a year from now you\u2019re gonna see Bitcoin blow through $100,000 probably next summer, right? And when they see that, and they see all this printing that\u2019s been taking place every single month, and they know not only all these companies getting bailed out, but you\u2019re gonna see municipalities getting bailed out, to the tune of billions, trillions of dollars! People are gonna say, This don\u2019t add up! There\u2019s something wrong! Why in the world is this Magic Internet Money going over $100,000 and it\u2019s not even real? Like, what is that?

This just does not make sense! You could talk about it from the oil standpoint \u2014 I think oil is the easiest one to understand: right now oil\u2019s getting obliterated, right? It\u2019s down to $20 a barrel, the newest report out of the IEA International Energy Agency there, they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re gonna hit max storage capacity by the middle of the summer and that they expect the storage to continue to fill up between now and then, and then it\u2019s gonna really get interesting! So what happens to the price after you can\u2019t store it anymore? Well then it really starts getting punished! So if a lot of the consumption continues to be down \u2014 and I don\u2019t know how it can\u2019t be with this many people out of work, this many people not even traveling \u2014 I mean I know personally how many times I\u2019ve gotten in my car and moved around in the last month, and it\u2019s not even comparable to what I was doing before this happened! So when you look at that price and you look at the price getting punished, and then eventually people are gonna start traveling more, but in this time between now and these storage capacities hitting max capacity, these producers \u2014 now maybe not Saudi Arabia and maybe oil isn\u2019t the best example, because they\u2019re trying to take all the market share from North America right now so they\u2019re laying on the capacity. I know they just did a deal but I don\u2019t necessarily buy all that. But let\u2019s just talk about any other commodity! [47:14] Those producers that are manufacturing this are pulling that capability offline. They have to! They\u2019re gonna go out of business if they don\u2019t do it! So they\u2019re pulling their capacity offline I mean all of this is just totally similar to everything you see in Bitcoin. They\u2019re pulling their capacity offline, and when they want to stand that back up it\u2019s not like they just turn on a light switch \u2014 that\u2019s labor that they had to lay off that went and found different jobs, it\u2019s all this stuff \u2014 so when they do want to start ratcheting it back up, there\u2019s quarter to two-quarter delay before they can produce at the capacity that\u2019s gonna be demanded of them. Well guess what happens to the price of commodities when that happens? They shoot up in a major way! Well now if you\u2019re talking about the Consumer Price Index it\u2019s based off of the delta of the price that it was before. Well if you have these prices that are hitting levels that are like \u2014 not even understandable \u2014 like oil under $20 a barrel, which could get well under $10 a barrel, these numbers are crazy low! If you even have the slightest bump in any of that, guess what just happened to your CPI? Well dude it just shot to the moon, right? So that could very easily happen in six months to a year from now, you\u2019re gonna see that playing out in addition to the Bitcoin price in addition to local governments being bailed out in addition to the government stepping in and continuing to print ungodly amounts of money, people getting their $2,000 check every month, to just \u2014 I mean this is the scenario that I\u2019m playing through my mind as to how I see the world in 6 months to a year from now \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna look like! And I just don\u2019t know how anybody who\u2019s experiencing that and then watching Bitcoin go up by $1,000 a day sitting on the sidelines and saying, Ah! Yeah, that\u2019s normal! It\u2019s not normal \u2014 it\u2019s insane, it doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 then they\u2019re gonna start digging into, What the hell is this? Why has this thing not been able to die? Especially people in finance, when they see the market cap going over $1 Trillion, it\u2019s gonna really attract a lot of eyeballs and a lot of people saying, Maybe I need to take a little bit closer look at this thing?"}

It worked out for them, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re able to get that, but people got really upset because I was just like throwing the obscene numbers, if you\u2019re daily cost averaging that into Bitcoin \u2014 the kind of returns you\u2019d get would be over $4 Billion! And I would say that\u2019s a little absurd but there\u2019s deeper points to that which is like, Do you have a good contract with the insurance company such that you get payout in actual money?

Let\u2019s buy it and keep these zombies alive! Is effectively what they\u2019re saying! I mean dude it\u2019s scary! I think that\u2019s the best way I can describe it is it\u2019s scary that you\u2019re seeing that! But let\u2019s look at why they\u2019re doing this. They cannot allow interest rates to go up. That is a fact! If interest rates go up, well now all of a sudden, they can\u2019t issue the debt at the volume that they need to issue it at. So they\u2019re gonna do everything they can possibly do to keep interest rates at 0%. So that\u2019s where the calculus for them gets really difficult because now they\u2019ve gotta do UBI. They realize there\u2019s social unrest at this point with the amount of people that are out of work and that\u2019ll continue to be out of work. So now we\u2019ve gotta do UBI. But we also have to continue to do QE, because we can\u2019t allow interest rates to go up or this whole thing goes boom! Now they\u2019re in this tricky situation where they can\u2019t turn off either one of those spigots! They can only basically turn them off. So I\u2019ve had a couple Tweets and it\u2019s hilarious because I don\u2019t hear a peep out of a single solitary Wall Streeter on my account, and I have a lot of Wall Streeters that follow me. Not a freaking word about the idea that, You\u2019re gonna get inflation, but you\u2019re gonna get it all at once. And it\u2019s gonna come like a flippin\u2019 tsunami! And what it is, is it\u2019s total trust in the bond market breaking down.It\u2019s at that point where everyone says, Hold on a minute! Oh my God! This is a tsunami coming at us! Oh my God! I gotta get up on a tree or I gotta get up on a building or I\u2019m gonna die! Right? And then everyone exits those positions out of these bond markets, and it\u2019s gonna be a flippin\u2019 tsunami.

So each time you go through one of these halving events, these quantitative tightening events, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s attempt at trying to escape gravity and exit the orbit! And so last time we saw that, we saw the attempt, the speculators could have taken it to $100,000 and then you could have maybe gone further. But, all the market participants were not at a point where you had enough buy-in for that to occur! So what happens? Well the gravity of the two-week difficulty adjustment took hold, and it brought it back down into its orbit where it needed to remain, until it could ramp itself up and go through its immunization in order to get ready for the next attempt of its exit velocity! So right now we\u2019ve got the quantitative tightening happening \u2014 it\u2019s gonna make another run at it! It\u2019s almost like watching a high jumper: he\u2019s going there, he\u2019s gonna jump over it. If he doesn\u2019t make it he comes back and he does 1,000 reps on the legs and then cools off for a couple weeks and then makes another run at the exit velocity. So what we\u2019re watching is we\u2019re watching the next attempt! And whether it makes it or not I have no idea! I kind of suspect based on the backdrop of everything that\u2019s happening in the other markets, that you probably have a pretty high probability that it\u2019s gonna make it this time! Probably a lot higher than a lot of people wanna give it credit for! But if it doesn\u2019t, no big deal! It comes back down into that stock to flow level that you\u2019ve got all that difficulty adjustment that\u2019s gonna pull it back in there if you can\u2019t get enough market participants to join the network and bring it to total dominance. It\u2019s gonna come back, it\u2019s gonna ramp up, it\u2019s gonna get stronger, it\u2019s gonna get more security on the network, you\u2019re gonna have new miners that are gonna enter \u2014 all of those things are happening, which are just making it that much stronger! It\u2019s completely antifragile! And there\u2019s plenty of people that have said that before. So if it doesn\u2019t make it this time it\u2019ll make it next time. It\u2019s not going away! And it\u2019s just a matter when it reaches its escape velocity! I\u2019m kind of hopeful that on this next one it\u2019s gonna make it!"}

But yeah at the same time using the $100,000 model, even $300,000 actually is completely within the range of the stock to flow price points. I fact I think $300,000 would be pretty equivalent to the $20,000 this past round in terms of the scale. If I remember correctly Plan B said about 3x-10x the S2F price is within bounds before you\u2019d be really breaking that model.

Those are the key inflection points in the four-year cycle \u2014 the thirds of it. So if you look at the first third of the four-year cycle, which takes you out to like the 10th November 2021, that\u2019s where you should see the price really hit its fever pitch through all the speculators and everyone stepping in. If you see the price continue to run way past that date, I would tell you things are really starting to get interesting as far as escape velocity goes! Then you take the next third. The next third you should see the bottom, whatever date that comes out to \u2014 I have not tried to quantify what that date it. But if you take another third of that next four-year cycle, that\u2019s where your bottom should be based on too much competition, the miners bringing it back down into reality, and then you\u2019re gonna see a bottom there because the difficulty adjustment\u2019s gonna assist with so much competition entering the space for hashing power. And then the next third takes you to the next halving event. Those are the dates that I pay close attention to."}

Now so you\u2019ll hear people say that the US dollar is backed by the might of the US military, and I think that the naive way of thinking about that is that the US military is holding a gun to people\u2019s heads, forcing them to use the US dollar. I think that the more sophisticated way of thinking about it is that the US military creates an environment where it is safe to use the US dollar, right? And they are able to repel opponents, adversaries, that are trying to undermine the US dollar and try to seize it. So to me the US military actually adds to the seizure-resistance of the US dollar, and that\u2019s why it is strategically important to have aircraft carriers around the world, securing trade routes and having a global financial system that is dollar-centered. And the way Bitcoin challenges this is not by challenging it head-on, but rather by flanking it in the sense of, Okay, we\u2019re going to do this in cyberspace. And it\u2019s interesting because the US military could attack Bitcoin in cyberspace, right? It could try to prevent nodes from getting online and essentially work with ISPs to kick people off. And it would be very challenging to route around that! We would have to have Adam Back\u2019s [inaudible 1:13:43] and Nick Szabo\u2019s short-wave radios to go pirate. But it\u2019s like, because we\u2019re operating on a different battlefield than the 21st century battlefields, we\u2019re able to dominate from a monetary perspective and now state actors are playing catch-up. And this isn\u2019t the US, even. It\u2019s like, China\u2019s trying to come up with their digital currency, but I don\u2019t think that they fully understand that the importance is in the networks, the peer to peer network, is the biggest advantage that we have as a user of Bitcoin.

Prior to Bitcoin it was a very strong argument, you could go with that all day long because in my opinion it was a valid argument. But now you just got a different situation so templating that into this situation I don\u2019t think is a direct correlation and it doesn\u2019t work anymore! Let\u2019s say China or the US has a major problem with this and they want to wreak havoc by shutting down Internet service providers causing issues with the satellites \u2014 all that kind of stuff. They can absolutely do that, and if they did that you would see the price in the interim absolutely suffer. Where I think that it\u2019s gonna run into an issue on the long haul is a lot of these governments right now are having issues with maintaining support of the general population. Just because of the situation we\u2019re in right now! So if they step in and they punch something in the face that was actually providing substantial returns to people, to your people that have never been able to make any type of return at all in any type of market, I think you\u2019re gonna potentially cause some social unrest, potentially cause \u2014 especially from some of these smaller nations that have been a victim of dollar dominance \u2014 which living in America a lot of Americans don\u2019t understand what that feels like or what that experience is like. But for every other country in the world they know exactly what that experience is like! And I think that\u2019s gonna potentially cause problems if you see some of those antics. So is it a risk? Absolutely. Is it a long term risk? I\u2019m not so sure. Is it a short term risk? Absolutely, if it would be implemented. So I\u2019m just trying to look at it as objectively as possible. I suspect this thing\u2019s gonna be moving out at a clip that\u2019s so fast that you have people \u2014 I mean let\u2019s face the facts: there\u2019s some people with substantial wealth in this space that can influence politicians, decision makers.

Nothing\u2019s changed! The bond market\u2019s fine! Look at the volatility in the yield, they haven\u2019t moved an inch! Because that\u2019s how they measure stability, they\u2019re looking at how much of the yield\u2019s changed? Well the yield\u2019s still pegged at 0% so there must be nothing wrong! Meanwhile if you look behind the curtain, the Fed is buying all of the selling on that fixed income at such a pace that \u2014 I mean the money\u2019s catching on fire it\u2019s coming in the door so fast as they\u2019re swapping the cash for the bonds!

And at the time it\u2019s very obvious what it means when a bank goes bankrupt \u2014 it\u2019s because they were doing fractional reserves and they went bust! So the state was having to get more and more draconian about it. First there was something about you had to go on a diet of bread and water until you could pay back everything. And it didn\u2019t stop so there was another like, If you do not pay back the debts within two weeks we\u2019re gonna ride around town telling everyone how evil you are and then we\u2019re gonna chop your head off! And there was still a credit crisis, meaning, even with that!

I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all in right now. It\u2019s going back to caveman times! So we have the Mark Cuban paradox \u2014 I also think that there\u2019s a Warren Buffett paradox! Where the focus is on owning assets that have a cash flow. And we see this in Bitcoin as well with people saying, You\u2019ve gotta invest your Bitcoin with BlockFi or whatever to earn a yield, otherwise it\u2019s not worth owning, basically is the view! Why is it that people have such an attraction to cash flow? It\u2019s kind of the investor\u2019s equivalent to the business mindset of having an obsession with revenue, right? Of, Okay, how do I get Bitcoin revenue, and then convert it into US dollars to pay for my expenses \u2014 how do I get cash flow out of Bitcoin as part of my portfolio?"}
{"link": "https://noded.org/podcast/noded-0700-with-preston-pysh/", "title": "Noded 0.70.0 with Preston Pysh", "text": "Preston Pysh [1:34:14]: This one\u2019s gonna be hard for people to change their mindset on I think for a very long time into the foreseeable future, simply because that\u2019s what your taught in school, if you\u2019ve been in the finance industry, if you\u2019ve been on Wall Street, if you own a business! You know how vital free cash flow is to the business! Everything revolves around it! The valuation comes down to the free cash flow compared to the discount rate you\u2019re using. And if I was gonna try to defend Warren Buffett, I would say: he is looking at owning good businesses that have a moat around them and what I mean by a moat is they have a competitive advantage against all of the other competitors in the space. If he owns that business and the currency changes, the business is still gonna be competitive moving forward in that aftermath or whatever that environment is afterwards. So if the currency changes from dollars to Bitcoins, well all of his businesses are now gonna start accepting Bitcoins and then he\u2019s gonna continue to still have a business that\u2019s kicking off free cash flow that has competitive advantage! So I think that\u2019s just how simple his narrative is: he does not need to hit anything out of the ballpark at all! He just needs to make sure that he doesn\u2019t lose money for all the people that have entrusted his leadership and his expertise going through this! And so I think he\u2019s just playing a very very defensive game. I think he\u2019s very skeptical because he doesn\u2019t understand the encryption and all the technology and the mining. He doesn\u2019t understand it, he sees it as being a bunch of millennials who are living on hopes and dreams trying to pump this thing. I think that\u2019s just how simple he\u2019s looking at it, and he\u2019s looking at this massive hundreds of billions of dollars enterprise \u2014 I mean he has over 70 operational businesses, I don\u2019t know how many non-operational subsidiaries that all have $10 Billion+ in market cap of how much ownership he has, so he\u2019s just looking at it from that lens. And so if you\u2019re a young Bitcoiner and you\u2019re saying, Oh Warren Buffett, he\u2019s an idiot! He doesn\u2019t know Bitcoin! Which is very easy to says, because you\u2019re looking at it from your lens, which is, I don\u2019t have a lot of money, my house isn\u2019t paid off, my car isn\u2019t paid off, I mean hell I\u2019m living in Mom and Dad\u2019s basement, and I need to break through! I need something that allows me to break through from this disaster of a life that I\u2019m living, and Bitcoin could go to $100,000 and I have 1 Bitcoin or I have 5 Bitcoins or whatever the number is, and that\u2019s gonna be my out! And that\u2019s gonna allow me to aggressively change the future and the life that I know there\u2019s a better version of our there for me! You\u2019re looking at things through two totally different lenses and I think that\u2019s where the contrast and the bashing of each other\u2014not that he bashes\u2014yeah I think you could say Buffet bashes it! Charlie Munger definitely bashes it! So I think that\u2019s the delta between vantage points."}

They\u2019re holding cash equivalents, or better! In the sense of yield-generating assets. And really when they say they\u2019re holding cash, what they\u2019re saying is they\u2019re holding liquid T-bills or some other yield-generating asset.

You\u2019re talking about a very hefty inflation tax!"}

My God! I just can\u2019t tell you how much my blood boils when I hear people say inflation or just like give their spin on what they think inflation is! I just \u2014 I have a hard time containing myself! It\u2019s a good thing people can\u2019t hear what I mutter whenever I type responses on Twitter! So if you\u2019re using CPI as your basket of inflation, well you can make inflation whatever you want! You just gotta change what\u2019s in or out of that basket! So let\u2019s just look at what\u2019s happened over the last ten years: you had central banks that provided ungodly amounts of quantitative easing into the market. So all that is when you hear the fancy term, Quantitative Easing \u2014 you\u2019re printing a bunch of money, you\u2019re going into the fixed income bond market and you\u2019re buying those bonds. You\u2019re basically buying them at whatever price you want and supplying all that liquidity to the people that were holding those bonds, and then the government then takes on those bonds and they\u2019re sitting on them. They\u2019re pulling them off the market. The way I measure inflation is it\u2019s the frickin\u2019 simplest equation ever! It\u2019s: the expansion of monetary policy balance sheets! So if you go and you look at all these central banks\u2019 balance sheets across the globe and you add up whatever that delta is over an annual basis: Surprise! There\u2019s your inflation! It\u2019s that simple! So if you are buying these bonds and all that money that you\u2019re printing is going into the fixed income market which then subsequently goes into the stock market \u2014 if that\u2019s where all the printing\u2019s going and you\u2019re not measuring any of that \u2014 it\u2019s not in your CPI basket, well guess what? You\u2019re not gonna see any of it, period! Right? Like, how freaking simple is that idea? Just the simplest flipping idea on the face of the planet! But yet, I can\u2019t find a flippin\u2019 person that gets that! It\u2019s mind-blowing to me! I just can\u2019t understand it! Well now that you got interest rates at 0% collectively across the globe, across all durations for the most part. I can\u2019t say they\u2019re at 0% but they\u2019re getting there really fast, and at the pace we\u2019re going with all this printing, you\u2019re gonna get there across the whole duration in the US, you\u2019re already there in all these other countries. Once it gets there, now it becomes just a total farce! And that money is gonna start showing up \u2014 if they keep expanding the balance sheet of all these central banks at the pace that they\u2019re expanding it, which they have not slowed down, they\u2019ve accelerated! Guess what? It\u2019s gonna start showing up in some weird places! Because you\u2019re not gonna see it coming out of the fixed income market when the whole thing is purchased like you saw over in Japan. The rest of the world is getting there, right? Japan\u2019s just the front-runner. They got there first, going into 1990 through the 80\u2019s and everything, that place was booming! Well they got to this point, they got there, they won the printing race! Now everyone is just catching up, and it\u2019s competitive devaluation in the basement. And all of that inflation is 100% there, you\u2019re just not seeing it because you\u2019re measuring something different. It\u2019d be like, Pierre I\u2019m gonna measure how tall you are but I\u2019m gonna go into the kitchen and measure how tall an apple is and use that as a measure for how tall you are! It\u2019s just total insanity! I heard it in the Cuban interview! I heard it halfway through the flippin\u2019 interview, he goes, Well in 2008 we did all this QE \u2014 nothing happened! We didn\u2019t get any inflation! So therefore \u2014 normalcy bias \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna happen this time! And it\u2019s just like, I want to bang my head against the wall! Well you go back to 2008, 2007, going into 2008 I can\u2019t remember the exact number but late 2007 your 10-year treasury was like slightly over 5% and so was your Federal Funds Rate was over 5%. In fact the Federal Funds Rate was higher than the 10-year treasury mid to late 2007! Okay? So if that happens and you go through this situation and then they drop rates and then you do a bunch of QE, then they even buy stuff that\u2019s not at the Federal Funds Rate but they\u2019re buying stuff that further out on the duration of the bond yield curve. And they\u2019re doing all this and they\u2019re supplying all this liquidity into the system \u2014 well they can keep doing that until interest rates all get to 0% collectively all across the globe. Once it gets there, that\u2019s why this situation right now is so different than 2008. Back then they had so much interest rate to play with and they had it across the whole duration of the curve, they didn\u2019t just have the Federal Funds Rate left, they had the whole duration of the curve left! If you\u2019re gonna bid the long tail of the curve on the bond yield curve, that\u2019s a lot of flippin\u2019 money to drop that 100 basis points! Like, people don\u2019t understand how many trillions of dollars it takes to drop the 30-year bond 100 basis points! It\u2019s massive! It\u2019s ungodly! I can go in and do the calculations on some of these tools I have on my websites and figure out what that number is, but it\u2019s huge! Massive! People don\u2019t understand that!"}

Because cash is supposed to be 0%! And that as you go further out on the yield curve, you\u2019re creating more and more cash, and then when you get into the stock market \u2014 same thing! If you\u2019re backstopping the stock market, you\u2019re saying, Tesla stock is cash in a FDIC-insured bank \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the same because we are writing a put on it and here\u2019s what the intrinsic value of it is from a monetary perspective. But that to me is like the inevitable slippery slope of fiat. If you have the ability to print money, why not monetize every asset and turn every asset into cash, because that is the most politically popular thing to do in any scenario, is to say that, No one can lose any money, and people can only make money, and that is the official policy of this government!"}

That is why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing \u2014 they cannot afford for interest rates to go up, because guess what? The price of everything, and I mean everything on the entire planet, is based on interest rates, okay? If interest rates go up \u2014 congratulations! The price of literally everything goes down. It\u2019s just that simple. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a stock, real estate, a bond, if interest rates go up, guess what \u2014 the price you pay to own it goes down. And more importantly the reason they can\u2019t allow interest rates to go up is because then they can\u2019t issue the debt and they can\u2019t spend at the rate that they\u2019ve been spending in the past. And guess what, every one of \u2019em wanna get re-elected and they wanna push that funding and all that money into their district so they\u2019re incentivized because there\u2019s absolutely no term limits for the people that are appropriating money! So if you really want to get to the critical variables as to what\u2019s driving this incentive structure that we have, it all comes down to those key points. So yeah you\u2019re gonna see more of the same because the people that are making decisions are incentivized to make decisions in that way!"}

All of the existing investors suffer from higher interest rates in the sense that their portfolios are decreasing in value if interest rates go up, right?

And just mathematically they\u2019re a much smaller constituency than the base of the existing investors, and this is the same thing with the real estate market! The only people that benefit from lower housing prices is new house buyers! And the entire stock of housing suffers from it, and everyone leveraging up against that housing, and it\u2019s the same across every asset class \u2014 you can generalize it \u2014 including 30-year treasuries."}

But obviously just for the listeners who may not know you, can you just give us a little bit of background on yourselves, where you came from, and what you were working on before all of this Bitcoin stuff?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Yeah definitely! I can go ahead and get us started. I have been following Bitcoin since around 2013. I lurked for a few years on Bitcoin Twitter and Reddit, and then did a few smaller projects. Around 2016 I was selling hardward wallets on OpenBazaar if you remember that decentralized marketplace. That was a fun and interesting experience. I have a mechanical engineering background and I dropped out of business school actually to join up with a local company in the cryptocurrency space in Boston. So I went through the phase of getting really into Bitcoin for the ideals of decentralization, and then getting into some of the other cryptocurrency stuff and then realizing that Bitcoin is what actually is important. So I and Ken also worked for a company called Nebulus in Boston that was making a couple different products. And one of them was Obelisk. And we were making cryptocurrency mining ASICs for Siacoin and for Decred. And so from 2017\u20132019 we actually learned how to make hardware and we crowdfunded and sold and shipped over $26 million in mining hardware over a couple different generations all manufactured in the USA. Around mid-2019 we started to get really excited about the idea of building a Bitcoin hardware wallet. We actually were really inspired by your podcast series with hardware wallets. I think that was around summer of 2019. Specifically that interview with Michael Flaxman where he was saying, Every Bitcoin hardware wallet sucks! And so a lot of those ideas resonated with us and we just kept talking about it. Ultimately myself, Ken, and two of our other teammates decided to quit our jobs in the beginning of this year and start Foundation Devices with the goal of making the Open Hardware Foundation for Bitcoin and a sovereign decentralized Internet, starting with our first product which is a Bitcoin hardware wallet called Passport."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Ken Carpenter: Yeah sure! So my background is computer science, so I\u2019m the software guy, software engineer and architect. In my career I\u2019ve done everything from embedded systems and network protocols, device drivers, embedded databases, wrote a lot of C code, a lot of C+++. Worked for companies like Electronic Arts, Arista Networks, I worked for a high frequency trading company in Manhattan, developing data analysis and visualization tools, and around 2017 I got interested in cryptocurrency so I was a bit of a late bloomer I guess. I was interested in Siacoin which was made by Nebulus, and as I got more interested in that I got involved with the community there, I actually ended up quitting my job at the high frequency trading company and joining Obelisk as an employee. While I was there I was responsible for the firmware for the miners, the web-based user interface, I wrote the customer portal front-end and back-end, and actually I was the VP of sales, too, which was interesting! Also involved with a lot of customers who were working to find colocation facilities to host their miners. Over the course of that project brought two generations of software and hardware to market as Zach was mentioning. And that brought us up to today where now I\u2019m head of software for Foundation Devices."}

Also I understand Zach you were not the CEO, you guys were working at this company, but could you just address some of those concerns that have been raised?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Yeah, absolutely! We\u2019re actually really proud of the work we did at Obelisk. I joined right as the company was getting started as an early employee in the summer of 2017. And as you know, later in that Fall was the big crazy bull market. And so we launched this crowdfunding campaign for these ASIC miners without even having a photograph or an image or any really information about what the device would look like. So we said, Give us money and in 12 months from now we\u2019ll give you a miner. As you know with a lot of hardware crowdfunding projects, they can often spiral out of control. That did not happen here. We actually shipped every device that we sold, we shipped over 12,000 ASIC miners. As Ken mentioned, across two generations of chips and three generations of industrial design. And we manufactured all of that in the US. We were an average of three or four months late depending on the batch that you ordered from. We were saying we would ship by August 31st I believe it was, of 2018, and I think the first shipment started going out in October or November, but we shipped everything. And it was all within about 20\u201330% towards the target spec that we were aiming for back when we started the sale. So I think the main contention is that the altcoin mining space is a total mess. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we didn\u2019t want to be in that space anymore. Because it feels a lot like gambling. You can deliver exactly what you promise, or really close to what you promise, but what actually matters is the price of these underlying cryptocurrencies, and then also the other mining manufacturers. And so, Bitmain and INNOSILICON ended up flooding the market, especially on the Decred mining side, and none of the miners \u2014 when they received their devices in 2018 on the Decred side \u2014 made any money. So we did some cool stuff! For example, we knew that when we shipped these devices they probably weren\u2019t gonna be profitable for the Decred miners and so we offered to do buybacks so that you could at least recoup some of your money and you can choose to reinvest that elsewhere. We were trying to be very, very friendly from a customer service perspective. We were extremely transparent throughout, so ultimately we\u2019re really proud of what we did, and having shipped over 12,000 devices with only very minor delays."}

How did that come about?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Yeah so we just felt this unshakable itch to be founders and to be working on Bitcoin. So \u2014 I\u2019ll let Ken comment for himself personally, but for me personally when I got into Bitcoin, I was very interested in it from the decentralization and efficiency perspective. So I was all about, Let\u2019s get rid of these intermediaries, let\u2019s get rid of these trusted third parties like banks and governments, and let\u2019s just allow people to transact directly peer to peer online! Over time, though, I started to go really down the rabbit hole from podcasts like this one and Tales From the Crypt, from books like The Bitcoin Standard, and I just got so enamored with the Austrian economics perspective and about Bitcoin being the perfect money. And so between that and then being frustrated with the existing hardware wallets, then also knowing that we as a team had the potential to just design better hardware than what exists on the market today, we just felt like we had to do it! So we founded the company in mid-March and we officially started the company in April of this year. We raised a little bit of money from some small funds and angel investors, and we worked from April until now and we\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019re gonna be manufacturing in early or mid-January."}

And then be responsible for those decisions. That for me was a big part too, just having the autonomy and the fact that those of us who moved on to Foundation all had really aligned goals. Along the lines of what Zach was talking about as far as Bitcoin and design and better hardware."}

So perhaps you could just tell us a little bit about the team. As far as I understand there are four main co-founders, and you\u2019re slowly building up the team over time?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Exactly. I, like I mentioned before, have a background in mechanical engineering. I\u2019m really obsessed with product design. I\u2019ve always been obsessed with Apple as a company, and so as you can imagine as I\u2019ve embraced Bitcoin and open source, I\u2019ve fallen more and more out of love with Apple, and hoping that we can do similar great hardware designs but have it all open. And we also have Matt as one of our co-founders. He\u2019s head of our circuit engineering. He was at Intel for a few years. He has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s in electrical and circuit engineering. He\u2019s a little bit of a circuit prodigy. And we also have Jacob who\u2019s our head of supply chain who was at Formlabs previously. And then we have Ken of course as well here who\u2019s our head of software and has an extensive background as he mentioned in every layer of the stack from firmware up to actually doing mobile apps."}

So far we\u2019ve done everything with our team of four. Between the four of us we can really hit every discipline of bringing hardware to market. A lot of the times, hardware teams struggle, especially on the supply chain and operations stuff \u2014 being able to source all these components and then manufacture them. We benefit from those experiences at Obelisk where we did so much manufacturing in the US. So we built up a lot of connections within different suppliers and manufacturers here, and so Passport is being fully assembled \u2014 circuit boards and everything \u2014 in the USA, which is also something that we\u2019re really proud of."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Passport is our effort to make hardware wallets as easy and secure as possible, while also giving you a device that you can feel proud of using, that feels elegant and up to the task, and maybe even worthy of your Bitcoin. So we\u2019ve used all the hardware wallets of course over the years, and have been personally frustrated by whether it\u2019s difficulty using the devices \u2014 for example, difficulty doing things as simple as entering a PIN number \u2014 to also being concerned from a security perspective about not having an air gap. And I think Michael Flaxman probably explained all these shortcomings much better than we can over a year ago on your podcast, but we think that things like PSBTs are really important, having a true air gap is really important, allowing for really easy text entry and navigation to encourage best practices when it comes to passphrases or other things like that is really important. So we just want to make that is so easy to use that maybe we can actually pull users off of Coinbase and other centralized exchanges, and also have this really great open source security model, where not only is the firmware completely open, but the hardware designs themselves are completely open, both for auditability and also so anyone can build off of our work."}

We\u2019re not claiming that we\u2019re the iPod, but we\u2019re definitely striving to follow those similar principles in terms of design and UX. We\u2019re just looking to make a product that millions of people can use. And our biggest fear is that we\u2019re gonna see a massive amount of new users over the next few years during this bull market, and then throughout this decade, and that because it\u2019s difficult to store your own keys, we\u2019re gonna see all those users go to Coinbase or go into Grayscale or something like that. And it\u2019s already quite scary where I think it\u2019s maybe over 1% of the Bitcoin supply is with Coinbase custody right now, and that\u2019s just not an environment that we want, and so we just wanna be able to provide users with actual sovereignty and ownership over their keys. But without them having to deal with a lot of the complexities and all the quirks of using today\u2019s generation of hardware wallets."}

And so one interesting aspect here and when you\u2019re doing a hardware wallet, some hardware wallet manufacturers in this space have chosen to try to provide the full stack, if you will. Like for example Ledger Live or Trezor\u2019s web wallet. Whereas other hardware wallet manufacturers have opted more to just say, No we\u2019re just making the hardware! You go and use the wallet software. So tell us a little bit about your approach on that part?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Yeah so our approach is definitely the second approach, and very much inspired by Coldcard\u2019s approach. We think that at its essence, hardware is a delivery mechanism for great software. And we think that the software developers that are working on all these different projects, whether that\u2019s Specter or Casa or whether it\u2019s the team at Unchained Capital or whether it\u2019s these newer multisig wallets like Lily or Nunchuk just came out a few weeks ago \u2014 there\u2019s so much innovation on the software side. Our goal as a hardware manufacturer is to give all the software developers access to just a great device that they can really easily integrate with their applications, and then provide their users with more security. What that does is it allows for faster innovation on the software side. For example, Ledger\u2019s Live app only just added full node integration like a week ago, but you\u2019ve seen so many other wallets that have full node integration over the last few years, because when you\u2019re more agile on the software side you can move faster. So that I think is key and important to us. And then there\u2019s also the privacy concerns: if you start to trap users into this ecosystem where you use your corresponding desktop app to also be a place where they can buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and then swap between them and all that kind of stuff, you start to create a walled garden, and you also start to collect a lot of data about these users. You know xPubs, you know IP addresses, you know all this information. We don\u2019t actually want any of this information! And so we try to carry that practice through even in our website and e-commerce store and we self-host everything on Wordpress or Woocommerce, we self-host our own analytics. We don\u2019t want to be giving data to anyone, and we want to be collecting the most minimal data as possible about our customers because there\u2019s serious privacy concerns when you\u2019re building this kind of stuff."}

I broadly agree with you. Perhaps just to \u2014 it might be fair to give a bit of a context there for some of the OG hardware manufacturers like Trezor and Ledger. They were started in a different era, you know? Before some of the software that we have today was available. Maybe part of it is like, they had to do things a certain way because they were around at a time when the tooling just wasn\u2019t there. But now we do have better tooling and we have things like Specter desktop and we have things like Blue wallet which we might chat a little bit about. Certainly I think the approach of each party trying to specialize harder into their area and say, Okay I\u2019m a hardware manufacturer and I\u2019m just gonna focus on making the best possible hardware wallet I can! I think that makes a lot of sense to me! Perhaps the challenge then is, How do you make it all interoperable? I guess PSBT is part of the answer here. But how do you figure out or think about working with the different wallets that are available out there?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert [22:08]: Yeah so I think PSBT is definitely key here, and luckily there\u2019s been a lot of great work that\u2019s been done. When we actually started the company \u2014 you know, Passport uses QR codes as the primary means of communication to establish a really secure air-gap \u2014 we did not know what standard we would be using for QR codes. Luckily, Blockchain Commons, which is a non-profit group in this space, was working on that. So they basically developed this, it\u2019s called [Uniform Resources specification (URs)] and that\u2019s actually what we use to have interoperability with the QR codes."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Ken Carpenter [22:50]: So they\u2019re also working on other standards to help hopefully make it easier for wallets to interoperate both between the software and the hardware wallets. So we\u2019re part of the working groups there and keeping up with what they\u2019re working on and providing our input on what we think the standard should be."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: The goal is basically that 1) we have a universal standard for communicating data over multiple QR codes with an air gap, and it looks like with this URs standard from Blockchain Commons we\u2019ve achieved that. And that\u2019s currently used by all of the different wallets that are using URs whether that\u2019s Cobo, Specter, Blue wallet \u2014 some of them are using an earlier beta version which is UR 1.0, but they should all be upgrading to UR 2.0 over the next several months, which is the final version released by Blockchain Commons. And then 2) Blockchain Commons is also doing some other cool stuff like standardizing the export, so that when you go ahead and you export your xPubs, you are able to export all of your xPubs and your various derivation paths in a single set of QR codes. Because right now it can be complicated \u2014 each software wallet requires an export from the hardware wallet in different formats. So with Passport we actually have a cool menu to make it really easy to pair up Passport with all of the different software wallets. We\u2019re doing a lot of manual work on the back end to figure out, Okay, what format did they need this data in? So hopefully over the next several months we\u2019ll be able to converge on the format for that as well, and then it gets really easy because you get to pretty instantly pair your hardware wallet with your software wallet, and then you get to pass data over multiple QR codes with the same protocol, and then you can have an explosion of air gapped singlesig and multisig hardware wallet transactions communicating with software wallets on desktop and on mobile!"}

Now is probably a good time to talk through my experience of trialing the unit out. So I\u2019ve got a test unit as I mentioned earlier. I put in the batteries, spawn it up, at the start there was the, Verify on the website that this is the legitimate device, and then I spun up a small seed just with $5 on it as you guys had and basically imported that into Blue wallet using the QR codes. And so when you do that \u2014 because the entire device is air gapped, right ?\u2014 so everything is QR or SD card, basically. So I did it with a QR code and from my perspective I thought it was an interesting experience. Certainly very different to the typical, Plug in a USB or Do the SD card. And yeah Blue wallet picked it up very quickly. For me it was just about making sure you had the right lighting so the cameras could talk to each other. But once you get through that, the scanning worked pretty simply! So I thought that was pretty cool. Can you tell us a little bit about your thoughts there around how it\u2019s gonna work with multisig?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert [26:14]: Yeah. It works very similar for multisig, to singlesig. I think the biggest difference with multisig is that 1) you typically have more data so that means more QR codes. Luckily as you probably saw from Blue wallet for Passport, they can pass QR codes back and forth pretty quickly. So you could pass \u2014 I believe for the tests you were doing it\u2019s typically for singlesig 2\u20134 QR codes \u2014 and for multisig it could be a bunch more. But even holding up your phone to your hardware wallet for 5\u201310 seconds is going to be much faster than passing a micro SD back and forth or plugging into USB. And so we think the QR codes make multisig really great. The other big thing about multisig is being able to import that quorum of your different public keys and derivation paths so that you can actually verify addresses on device. That\u2019s also something great that QR codes work for. It\u2019s really easy to pass that information to the device in an air gapped way, using just a few QR codes that are encoded with this URs 2.0 protocol."}

And that you\u2019re not signing to some quorum that doesn\u2019t include only your three devices. Whereas as I understand then, once you register the other devices in the quorum, that\u2019s now starting to give you additional protections against this kind of thing."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert [28:09]: Exactly! One thing that we haven\u2019t looked at closely yet because we\u2019ve been pretty heads down, but I did listen to your podcast with Stepan [Snigirev] from a couple weeks ago, and I believe Specter, while it\u2019s experimenting with the idea of, When you display or you pass an address, you\u2019re also passing the corresponding derivation path for that address, and that makes it extremely easy to verify on the hardware wallet that the address belongs to your device. Otherwise what you end up having to do is you have to brute force or pre-derive a lot of different potential addresses on the hardware wallet in order to compare. But if you have the derivation path, you can just immediately go and check if the addresses match. Hopefully throughout 2021 we\u2019ll see some standards form on that side to make it just brain-dead simple to instantly verify that a singlesig or multisig address belongs to the hardware wallet. And I do think that the various multisig services \u2014 I hope all of them add this in 2021! Not all of them have the ability to export the multisig quorum information to a hardware wallet. I know Specter does, I believe Unchained Capital does now, I think they started that with Trezor, I think it\u2019s also supported by Coldcard. I don\u2019t believe that Casa does at this time, I don\u2019t think that Blue wallet does either right now. So I think we\u2019ll see a lot of progress on that in 2021 and hopefully by the end of next year we\u2019ll just have really really easy standards to just verify an address on the hardware wallet and get people used to that as part of the flow. Because I think that\u2019s something that people aren\u2019t really used to right now. Oftentimes you just quickly create a receiving address and then send to that address. I think being able to quickly scan a QR code of that address from your own hardware wallet and get the thumbs up that the address belongs to you is going to be a killer feature!"}

Perhaps in the past some of these things were available only to professional level or highly technical Bitcoin wizards!

It\u2019s making some of these higher security aspects available to the everyman or at least it\u2019s going to start out with the more tech-savvy people. Some of the points that some of the listeners might be thinking at this point is good to address\u2014it\u2019s common that in this space, people want something to be battle tested before they trust it with any serious amounts of funds. How are you thinking about that with, Well, it\u2019s a first edition of a hardware wallet, listeners might be unclear that, Okay, it\u2019s the first edition. Who knows if the first edition will really work? Maybe there will be hardware security hacks on it and things like that? How are you planning to get through that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert [33:23]: I think that\u2019s definitely very valid! There\u2019s a couple different things there. One is that users should definitely slowly adopt Passport, right? We\u2019re definitely not recommending that you go buy a Passport and then you throw all of your sats onto it in a singlesig setup. So I think multisig helps a lot there. There\u2019s definitely a need for another air gapped multisig-friendly hardware wallet. In Michael Flaxman\u2019s latest guide, I\u2019m pretty sure that in his 2-of-3 multisig setup \u2014 for the third key \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy with any of the hardware wallets and so he recommended creating a seed offline and storing that offline on paper or on metal. And so we hope that we can be that third option! That way if there is a bug or if there is a vulnerability, it won\u2019t impact you, right? It won\u2019t impact loss of funds. There\u2019s a couple of other things that we\u2019re we\u2019re doing. One is, the hardware architecture we\u2019re using is not like invented by us \u2014 it\u2019s the same architecture that Coldcard and Bitbox 02 use \u2014 which is when you have the standard microprocessor and then a secure element chip. In this case we\u2019re using the same secure element chip as both Coldcard and Bitbox 02. From that perspective it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve invented some new architecture. The open source component also really helps because all of the hardware and all of the firmware is completely open. If we were closed source then that would be a really really hard sell. I\u2019m not sure if Ken wants to add anything about the firmware, but we are having the Wallet.fail guys do our security audit."}

So one of the great things about open source \u2014 especially when you\u2019re dealing with GPL 3 code, which is very copyleft code where you open source your code and you only let other people use it if they\u2019re going to open source their work in return \u2014 so one of the benefits of that is we have not started completely from scratch even though we\u2019ve made a lot of changes, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be really important to have experts look at what we\u2019ve done and test it out. We have not just gone in, started completely from scratch and just messed around and put together some V1 of firmware that is completely untested! We\u2019ve tried to use some building blocks and then architecture from existing devices so that we\u2019re not just flying blind here.

I think another point that listeners might be thinking is: it also takes monitoring what\u2019s going on in the Bitcoin space. As a quick example, as I understand there was that SegWit vulnerability earlier in the year. Technically this had actually been disclosed \u2014 I believe it was Gregory Sanders (@theinstagibbs) who had disclosed it maybe a couple years ago on the Bitcoin mailing list \u2014 actually what happened earlier this year was Saleem Rasheed had gone and done an exploit based on that, and so then that triggered off a round of Trezor updating their firmware and so on. The question I\u2019m getting to is \u2014 it essentially takes a lot of: following the space and knowing what\u2019s going on, probably some familiarity with Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Core code, so how are you looking at that and trying to stay on top there?"}

One of the things I\u2019ll be doing in the coming few weeks is going back over a lot of those issues that have been found over the time since we first started working on it, and integrating some of the patches and addressing some of the vulnerabilities. But I\u2019ve also started looking at some of the Bitcoin Core, just to get a cursory level of familiarity with the code before I can start diving in. It\u2019s definitely on our list to get more familiar with that code, and also we\u2019re looking to hire more people in the future to help augment that knowledge."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Exactly. And then I think by sharing some common code with Coldcard helps us a lot, and then just looking at all the different updates from Ledger, Trezor, Bitbox, and from Coldcard on every release cycle has allowed us to get really comfortable with everything. We started the software project in April, and so we\u2019re completely up to date with all the vulnerabilities from before April, and then over the next several weeks before we ship \u2014 as Ken mentioned \u2014 we\u2019re going to be making sure that we address all the stuff that\u2019s happened since April. That Segwit vulnerability was definitely interesting, where you can get someone to sign multiple transactions and then piece together basically a fraudulent transaction and steal their coins. Coldcard fixed that in an interesting way by storing a hash of the transaction on the Coldcard. I know that also that vulnerability created a lot of controversy. I believe that was the same fix that caused Trezor to close down a lot of derivation paths which broke compatibility with various software wallets. So we\u2019re really cognizant of \u2014 as we make sure that we\u2019re caught up with everything in the space and keeping track of all the vulnerabilities, we wanna make sure that we fix things in a way that makes the software wallet developers happy as opposed to breaking any functionality, which was pretty contentious earlier this year. I know that some things like BTCPay was affected, Casa was affected, a bunch of stuff was affected with how that specific Segwit vulnerability was fixed."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: Yeah definitely! I\u2019ll probably give just a higher level view of how we think about seeds and then Ken can take us through some of the nitty gritty, because we do something different than all the other hardware wallets with our main source of entropy. The way we think about seeds though \u2014 we kind of share Casa\u2019s perspective on this, where we think that for normal people, seeds are really challenging to deal with. Our ideal scenario is that we never show the seed to the user. And that\u2019s a different approach than what I think all the other hardware wallets take. The reason for that is because, as Bitcoin scales to millions and hundreds of millions of people, I think a majority of people still don\u2019t really know what the seed phrase represents. If you look at the recent Ledger and now Trezor phishing scams going on right now \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually clicked through these websites to test them out for fun \u2014 they typically revolve around tricking a user into entering their seed in a web browser. I think that that just doesn\u2019t work in the long term for a normal person to be expected to write down and manage these seeds. So I think that multisig is really really important there. And one thing we\u2019re doing as well \u2014 that you did not see in your demo because we haven\u2019t finished this feature yet \u2014 but it\u2019s the same way that Coldcard provides an option to do Micro SD backups. We actually include two industrial grade Micro SD cards with every Passport purchase. And one of them is for users to, if they want, backup their device to the Micro SD card, and that\u2019s encrypted and they can write down a few BIP39 words off the word list in order to serve as the password to that SD card \u2014 but then they never actually see the seed. They never have to write down the seed. In order to get the seed out, you have to have both the Micro SD card and the password. And I think that\u2019s a much better solution for the average user than writing the seed down. In terms of entropy, we have a few different sources of entropy in the device. We do have the embedded true random number generator in the secure element. We have the random number generator in the microprocessor. We also have an ambient light sensor, but we have something really really cool called an avalanche noise source"}

And we sample the noise and then use that sampled noise through a whitening algorithm and come up with random numbers. And we\u2019ve done some work running it through random number analysis. We\u2019re still doing some more work there but it\u2019s looking really really good as a random source on its own. And then what we\u2019re gonna do is probably combine that with the RNG on the MCU and the SC and maybe the ambient light sensor to get a bunch of different sources and combine them together."}

Meaning that, in all of these electronic devices on the market, you have a ton of chips that are basically executing blackbox firmware. So the chip itself is a blackbox because we can\u2019t, for example, go to ST Microelectronics \u2014 who makes our microprocessor \u2014 we can\u2019t go them and say, Hey, can you give us your chip design so we can audit it? That\u2019s a complete blackbox. Likewise, we can\u2019t go to Microchip \u2014 who makes the secure element \u2014 and say, Hey can you give us the design of the block on your chip that has the true random number generator? And so what\u2019s crazy in the electronics world is that pretty much every key or advanced component has an embedded chip running unknown firmware! That\u2019s also true of most LCD screens and capacitive touch panels. So if you have a touchscreen, for example, on a hardware wallet, it probably has two chips that are running unknown firmware. And so the great thing about using this avalanche noise source is that we\u2019re able to create entropy without trusting any blackbox silicon. One of our design goals over the next, probably few generations of Passport devices, is to further and further reduce the use of blackbox silicon to the point where every single chip in the device is open or we know exactly what kind of code is running on that. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re striving for from the philosophical perspective."}

In terms of that, I also wanted to ask about the firmware and how firmware updates would be done. How would they be verified and put into the new device. Can you talk us through that process?"}

So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re only allowing firmware that\u2019s signed by Foundation, first of all \u2014 with a caveat that I\u2019ll mention later. We\u2019re doing a scheme where we have two signatures that are required for each firmware update. Let\u2019s say we have five keys that are available: any two of those could sign a firmware update. Those would be held in different locations, so it gives a bit of friction to creating a firmware update for us, which is something we want. For example, I couldn\u2019t go rogue and publish a firmware update on my own \u2014 it would take at least two of us to go rogue. And so the idea there is to provide that friction. And then on the bootloader, the bootloader is the one that is in control of deciding when firmware can be installed or not. It will validate the signatures on the firmware, and we have the blue and the green light on the device, and it will only turn the light blue when the firmware has been validated and confirmed that it was signed by Foundation Devices. That\u2019s the first thing. We are looking at adding the ability for a customer to add their own signing key and keeping that key in the secure element. That would be a way for really advanced users to build their own code and load that onto the device. So if we were to look at how that works: the user is gonna get their key onto the device and load their firmware through the SD card, and the bootloader will pause on every boot if there\u2019s non-Foundation firmware on there, just so that no user would be fooled in thinking that, Hey I\u2019m running legitimate Foundation firmware here. There\u2019s always gonna be an indication that it was firmware that was loaded by a third party. We\u2019re also looking at a hardcore unit which would come completely unprogrammed. It would be probably a different SKU with a little bit different looking hardware, maybe different colors to the device and to the printed circuit board. But that would come without a loaded bootloader on it, even. And so you could basically hook up your own JTAG programming device and flash your own bootloader, flash your own firmware, and then decide to lock it down at any time if you wanted to do so. Maybe they\u2019ll be like 10 or 20 people in the world that want that, but we want to be able to support those people if they want to do that kind of level of validation and verification on their own."}

It\u2019s code that\u2019s loaded in at the factory, and once it\u2019s there it\u2019s permanently there on the device and it cannot be updated with the firmware update. And so our design philosophy with the bootloader is to make it as minimal as possible so that it barely does anything except very basic functionality like figuring out what firmware updates to allow. And then as Ken mentioned, there\u2019s definitely some tiny percent of users that just want to load up their own bootloader and so, it\u2019s not too complicated for us to give that to users because it just means basically diverting a device at the factory that we would have programmed and sealed \u2014 we\u2019re just sending that off to a very advanced technical user, maybe with a little kit where they can hook it up to their computer and they can build everything from source themselves. So while we\u2019ve made some key design decisions \u2014 we\u2019re restricting it only to allow firmware signed by Foundation Devices, we are still offering some of these power user features because we think, from a sovereignty perspective, that it\u2019s really really important for the people that want to be able to build their stuff from source\u2014they should be able to build that stuff from source \u2014 and we as a company should never stop them from doing that. Because then it\u2019s a very slippery slope to be an Apple-like walled garden."}

I also thought it would be good to talk a little bit about in terms of attack surface of the device. The main two methods that I\u2019ve seen from using the device, you see the QR code and the SD card. So can you talk to us a little bit about why you chose those methods and not having USB?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Ken Carpenter: Yeah. So we know that when you plug something into a computer, you\u2019re potentially connecting it to the Internet. If there is any kind of malware installed on that computer, it would have access, potentially, to data over the USB. And we just wanted to close that down completely as a potential attack vector. If you\u2019ve got an air gapped wallet that also has a USB connector, there\u2019s just the ability for you to get lazy: you don\u2019t want to do the air gapped way today, so you plug it in, and then you get pwned. With Passport, that\u2019s just not even an option. What we want to do as a company is provide people with options that basically do the right thing and encourage them to do the right thing whenever possible \u2014 like, the secure thing. This is a way, we think, that achieves that, where the only way you can interact with the device is through Micro SD card and through QR codes. So we\u2019re just cutting off entire vectors for attack, and mistakes."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert [52:00]: And ideally when we first set out to do this, being kind of silly, we didn\u2019t want to even put a Micro SD card slot on the device at all. Because a Micro SD card is almost like a mini computer! You could theoretically have a compromised Micro SD that has some tiny little chip or circuit on it or something that monitors or modifies the data that\u2019s being passed. The unfortunate truth is that, as of right now, 1) we\u2019re using micro-Python and so our firmware updates are by nature going to be too large for QR codes. You know, we would love to be able to do a firmware update via QR codes. It seems kind of silly if you\u2019re talking about hundreds of QR codes, but if you\u2019re making some minimal changes to certain lines of code and you\u2019re able to just pass the delta, it could be possible on a future unit, especially if we try to move to something like color QR codes or something like that in the future that can transmit a lot more data. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re keeping our eyes on. Just QR codes themselves are fantastic in terms of the auditability! You can always scan the QR codes and really quickly \u2014 either on mobile or on desktop \u2014 you can verify the output of that. So it\u2019s much much harder to pass something malicious through QR codes. And just to add on to what Ken was saying about USB and maybe something about Bluetooth. There\u2019s so many Bluetooth vulnerabilities all the time. We really don\u2019t think a hardware wallet should have Bluetooth. You could just Google \u201cBluetooth vulnerabilities\u201d I think there are like 3 this year that are pretty bad. And then with USB you can do a lot of tricky things with USB. And even basic dumb attacks that you wouldn\u2019t even expect! Like Ledger had a vulnerability for example where you can modify the normal MCU on the Ledger \u2014 which is like the non-security chip on the device \u2014 and it could act as a keyboard! And so your first instinct might be like, Okay, that\u2019s a weird attack. What\u2019s the big deal there? But if you combine those avenues of attacks with the types of phishing scams that we\u2019re seeing today, if you all of a sudden have the ability to open a web browser and take the user to a website, maybe that website is actually malicious and it\u2019s asking for your seed and it tricks some large number of users. So we really don\u2019t think that USB or Bluetooth belong in a hardware wallet. We also don\u2019t think that SD cards do either but we\u2019re at a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to remove that. As Ken was mentioning, our goal is to always encourage the best user behavior and not give users any reason to trade off security for convenience which is what technology like USB and Bluetooth does."}

One thing is we\u2019ve already made all of our hardware designs open source under CERN\u2019s open hardware license. CERN being the research organization, the one that makes the Large Hadron Collider and other projects. It\u2019s a really great license. It\u2019s specifically designed for hardware. We\u2019re using the strong variant of their license which is very similar to GPL. It\u2019s a viral copyleft hardware license so anyone is welcome to use our hardware designs as long as they open source their work as well, and preserve the copyright attribution. What\u2019s great about that is that if you wanna come and use some of our hardware designs, if you want to, for example, look at our implementation of the avalanche noise source \u2014 which we actually implemented from Bunny\u2019s OHL open source designs from B-Trusted \u2014 anyone is welcome to do that and use that in their projects. Likewise we\u2019ve also open sourced the first alpha version of our firmware as GPL V3 which is another viral copyleft open source license for software. So anyone is welcome to use that work. We have contributed to the Blockchain Commons URs standard. Ken ported over the URs libraries to Python and Micro-Python, and so we published that code is completely open course. Ken is that under BSD?"}

And then if there\u2019s things we can do to make contributions back to other projects or even other hardware wallets like Coldcard, we\u2019re totally open and interested in doing so. However, each hardware wallet is designed differently so sometimes it can be really hard to take code from one and move it to the other, especially when you have different hardware in the device \u2014 different components. Sometimes instead of just doing a quick pull request it looks more like porting work from project to project \u2014 but we\u2019re totally open to that as well. We\u2019ve also used other work and we\u2019ve been really careful to give attribution to the different open source libraries.

Yeah I mean, this is one of those spaces where there\u2019s always wars going on between different producers and makers of things. So I don\u2019t want to get into the drama of that, but hopefully at least there can be some level of multisig Kumbaya going on and people will be just like, Hey we\u2019re all gonna do well out of this! With a lot of people coming in, and if we all play nicely together then maybe that is a reasonable future that we can hope for. One other area to discuss is pricing of the device. On the website the preorder is listed at $299 USD. Can you tell us a little bit about why this price point? And for what kinds of people do you think this makes sense? Obviously a straight new hodler who only has $30 it\u2019s not worth it for them. Who\u2019s the kind of person it makes sense for?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/jWADOtr4GAo", "title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "text": "Zach Herbert: This makes sense for anyone who holds at least a few thousand dollars of Bitcoin or more. This definitely does not make sense if you hold $1000 of Bitcoin. If you\u2019re gonna do that and hold a smaller amount of Bitcoin you\u2019re probably gonna just have it on Cashapp or River or one of these other services. Or using something like Blue wallet on your phone. We think that from a price point perspective, it\u2019s not like we decided to just start at this price point and then that\u2019s it \u2014 we worked at it from a first principles perspective. It\u2019s more expensive to make a really high quality hardware design that uses a larger screen that\u2019s more trustable. The screen actually is auditable, it has a no-embedded processor running a known firmware, no blackbox silicon, so the screen is more expensive, we have a really high quality keypad experience \u2014 that\u2019s more expensive. We use high quality plastics, the main structure of the device is casted in zinc alloy and plated in real copper. We have a processor that I think is the fastest processor by a good margin in any hardware wallet. It\u2019s running at 480 MHz at its fastest, compared to Trezor\u2019s Model T which is 120 or Coldcard which is 80 MHz. It\u2019s significantly faster, that\u2019s both to run the camera and also have faster processing of PSBT transactions. We\u2019re also assembling the device in the USA and we\u2019re physically on the floor at our manufacturer. And so when you add all that stuff up it does make for a more expensive product. Any hardware wallet with a QR code that is open source, that is running parts from reputable companies like STM or Microchip or Omnivision for the camera, Sharp for the screen, it\u2019s going to be more expensive than your USB wallet with a small screen. And I think that\u2019s okay! Because, especially if Bitcoin finds itself in a really positive bull market scenario, I think that paying a little bit more money for a much better user experience, and a really great air gap. I think it\u2019s a no-brainer purchase!"}

I pre-ordered it. But firstly, just tell us a little bit about it. What is The Fiat Standard? What are you trying to achieve here?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: The Fiat Standard was born out of the questions that were left unanswered in The Bitcoin Standard. So The Bitcoin Standard explained how Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented in terms of its salability across time, it beats anything else that we\u2019ve ever had because it has the highest stock to flow ratio, and it gave plenty of examples of how this generally means that this leads to Number go Up technology, which unfortunately I hadn\u2019t had the term when I wrote the book! It would have a lot if I could have just explained NgU technology! Because of the increase in the value of the harder money, eventually it ends up dominating the other monies and driving them out of the market. So given that that is the implication of the Bitcoin standard, it would be interesting to imagine how such a process could unfold? How can the current monetary system be overthrown. And so to do that, this book begins by studying the fiat monetary system from first principles really. In a similar way to how I studied and explained The Bitcoin Standard in 2017, published in 2018. I looked at the thing, and I tried to make sense of the economic properties of it and tried to explain them with reference to debates in academic economics. And so I thought Bitcoin is a simpler, neater system, it\u2019s a more advanced system, it\u2019s a system that performs the functions of money and settlement in a far neater, simplified way that allows us to really discern the essential elements of these functions. And then we can apply that lens looking at fiat. And try and understand how fiat functions. And as I started to think in these terms, I started to realize really, this is quite a useful way of understanding how fiat functions. In a similar way, you and I went through a period where we were alt-curious and we looked into altcoins and read some of their stupid white papers, and when you go through this exercise of looking at the entire monetary system and trying to understand where it goes \u2014 where\u2019s the mining happening? How are the rewards distributed? How are the transaction fees paid? And so on. You start to form a picture of the essentials of how this thing works. And so, applying that framework to fiat would be a useful of beginning to assess how fiat works, and then using that as a springboard to explain what happens as Bitcoin continues to grow and fiat continues to do what it has been doing forever."}

Because I\u2019m sure in many cases, people who are transacting with gold directly never intended for it to become so captured, but \u2014 how do we end up in this kind of situation?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: I think looking at fiat in terms of trying to understand the problem it solves and trying to understand how it behaves in the way that it behaves \u2014 I think in the same way that with Bitcoin, I thought that salability across time was the most interesting aspect and the most fruitful avenue to explore to understand how this thing works. I think with fiat, really, the killer app behind it is salability across space. The ability of fiat money, essentially, to settle trade across space at a much faster rate than all the alternatives that existed at that time, because all the alternatives effectively were based on physical money. Actual metals that you had to lug around and move around and put on boats, and sometimes the boats would sink while crossing the Atlantic or the Mediterranean or whatever. By substituting the credit of government \u2014 which is what fiat money does. Effectively, what fiat money does is that instead of having gold as the native token of the payment system that is international, you end up having the credit of the sovereign serving as the token. And so the token supply is essentially the supply of whoever can draw credit on the sovereign. Whoever can issue credit backed by the sovereign, essentially. So anybody who creates credit gets to essentially create new fiat tokens. And when you think about it this way it starts to make a lot of sense!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Stephan Livera [08:37]: Yeah, for sure. And I think that really aligns well with the way Carl Menger explains the origins of money. He\u2019s talking about salability through time and space, and so really what is happening is some of this capture of the system happened because people wanted something salable through space, and more easily. But then what happens is people end up using custodians, they end up using these third parties, and there essentially is a lot of trust placed in that system. And so essentially it seems as though, as the system requires more trust in it \u2014 and that\u2019s where things can get manipulated in terms of the price and the ratios, the price of gold or the reserve ratios required, or the way you can extend credit in such a system. So, can you tell us a little bit about the importance of trust in that system and perhaps the mistakes that were made along the way?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [09:38]: If you read The Bitcoin Standard, and I think you and I \u2014 the way that we think \u2014 generally we see this move from gold to fiat as just being a completely horrible mistake! And I think the focus there in that view which I think is highly justified, is that, you look at the salability across time of gold. You look at the stock to flow of gold, and you see that it offered us a safe haven. It offered everybody a neutral medium of saving an atypical money that was international, it was available for anybody! You could start saving from the day you were born and keep saving until you die and the same gold coins can continue value throughout your life. And you could take them anywhere in the world! And because it had a very high stock to flow ratio, substituting that with government money which had a much higher stock to flow ratio, at very high cost to society and civilization which I\u2019m sure you and your listeners are very well familiar with. But I think in a sense you would like it if those governments and central banks ran these systems based on gold, but if you start thinking about it in terms of engineering terms, if you have gold you are effectively having to trust in these people anyway. The gold has no \u2014 once you see Bitcoin and you see how Bitcoin functions and you can run your own node and you can run the numbers \u2014 once you see how this system works, you start to really think, you can see where the shortcoming of gold is from the fact that just moving gold around \u2014 salability across space in gold \u2014 is pretty inadequate for the 19th and 20th century. Well for the 19th it could keep up I guess, but for the 20th was when it really couldn\u2019t keep up. And in that sense, whether it was the Bank of England or the US Federal Reserve, they did offer superior salability across space. I think we kind of have to grudgingly admit that fiat just allows you to send money across the world in a way that becomes much more efficient than having to lug gold pieces around, because lugging gold around is expensive and risky. And if you just hand over the entire system to the government where you rely on the trust of the government, then the government runs its own accounts, it does its own magic, and your money gets from point A to point B. But, you know, occasionally it blows up, and it\u2019s usually bleeding value, but you can\u2019t have everything in life! And obviously there was no real free market competition. We couldn\u2019t build a free market alternative around gold because the nature of its centralization means that you have to be moving along with the legal and political and traditional institutions of the country in which you\u2019re operating the system. So I think it is really the salability across space that is what gives fiat its advantage, and it\u2019s what led to the compromise of the monetary supply. And you see that the story of how slowly but surely they went off gold, and then even though the price of gold could rise, it still could not displace a national currency because you just couldn\u2019t build a monetary system around gold. So everybody is stuck speculating on national currencies and trying to figure out which one of them is going to be the least worst."}

Also, one point that stuck out to me in Chapter 2 is you mention here about how essentially the government will manipulate the price of gold in terms of \u2014 that\u2019s one of the things that they would try to do. One idea that comes up here is the devaluation of the pound to allow the banks\u2019 reserves to back the currency. And you point out here that this would be unspeakably unpopular. The question then is, do you think people\u2019s attitudes towards these things have shifted these days? And perhaps were they more cognizant of these matters back then?"}

I think about fiat in first principles terms. The whole book is almost modeled after The Bitcoin Standard in that I\u2019m trying to locate parallels for each. And so I went back to 1914 in the beginning of the war and looking at how fiat came about. How we moved from gold \u2014 and you see, back then, I think this is a really important fact \u2014 that there was no Satoshi and there was no designer and there was no idea about where they were headed with this design. There was no vision in 1914\u201315 as these countries came off the gold standard. There was no end goal in anybody\u2019s mind that in 1973 there would be no link whatsoever between gold and money. In the mind of everybody, the question was, When do we return to gold? How do we return to gold? And it was well understood that the return to gold had to happen. The Sterling Pound was a matter of national pride in England, and they\u2019ve been on this rate of 4 pounds \u2014 I forget the exact rate for 1 oz of gold \u2014 they\u2019d been at that since Isaac Newton himself had set that rate, so it\u2019d been around for 200 years. It was only interrupted during the Napoleonic War, but they returned back to the original price! So during the first world war, it was initially well understood that we\u2019re going back on a gold standard and yet they managed to drag this on for 50\u201360 years and never went back on the gold standard. And we moved on to this system that really emerged politically out of the politics of World War I and World War II \u2014 not through design."}

Another really interesting point I saw from Chapter 2 is this discussion around this idea of exporting inflation. There\u2019s this idea that other countries are using either the US dollar or UK sterling, and in some sense, the US and the UK can benefit from this, because they can unload some of their \u2014 they\u2019ve got more bag holders, right?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: Exactly! Exactly! This is \u2014digging in Chapter 2, I\u2019ve really come to realize the importance of something that is called the gold exchange standard. And this was a system where Great Britain had implemented with its colonies in the late 19th century, where \u2014 with some of its colonies \u2014 whose central banks essentially kept their reserves in London in the form of English pounds. And so, the Bank of England made a great trade on selling these colonies claims on gold which effectively these countries weren\u2019t going to cash out very frequently, because they needed them in the Bank of England network. They needed them on the Bank of England platform, because they were using this to settle their accounts with all the other central banks for buying stuff. This was their foreign account, essentially. So it was kept in London so the Bank of England didn\u2019t really have to fulfill withdrawals for this very frequently, and at the outbreak of World War I they had only 31% reserves of gold to back up the English pounds that were outstanding for the countries that were on the gold exchange standard. So that ultimately was the driver of the problems of the Bank of England. That\u2019s why they had to \u2014 not officially, they didn\u2019t officially go off the gold standard because they wanted to maintain their position as the financial center and they kept on insisting that that was never going to happen, but the problem started because of this, and the solution, in typical fashion\u2014 to fashion the solution out of the problem \u2014what they did was they effectively sought to export this model to the rest of the world after World War I by implementing all these new international arrangements whereby other countries needed to hold English sterling pounds in order to settle their accounts. And so there was the Treaty of Genoa in 1922 where the US and the UK basically dumped their bags of mainly sterling \u2014 the US did a little bit of dumping \u2014 but it was really the UK that had the most bags because they had gone off the gold standard in 1914. The US did not go off the gold standard until 1917. So for the first three years of the war, the UK and the rest of Europe were bleeding gold to the US. The US only really left the gold standard in 1917 so they still had quite more gold and were in much better shape than Britain. And the US was able to go back to the gold standard in 1922 but the UK was not. So then this became popular \u2014 the gold exchange standard \u2014 they get all these countries to hold pound sterling, and usually it came along with talk about financial stability and international cooperation and, We\u2019re gonna need you to do your part by holding our bags for us while we print more sterling. And then this became more and more popular, and then this was basically what they did with the Bretton Woods Agreement, where the US copied the model and took it over from the Brits, and started dumping their dollar bags on the rest of the world. It\u2019s the same thing \u2014 it\u2019s the gold exchange standard \u2014 wherein all those countries don\u2019t get to use the gold themselves! They get to use the pound or the dollar which are backed by gold, and they get to have a promise that, Okay, your paper is redeemable as long as you don\u2019t try and redeem it in any significant quantities!"}

And so, it takes some time as well for that process to happen. I guess it\u2019s a process of capture. So the better your monetary good can resist it, well, the better you are as a society, stopping a cultural and societal degeneration, in certain respects. It\u2019s also important to \u2014 just talk a little bit about the politics of revaluations? There was a sense of, when the government or the central bank and they\u2019re negotiating and deciding, like, Oh okay, you\u2019re coming to the table and you\u2019ve got this much gold. And so that is like an indicator of how much power or relative strength you have versus the other \u201cplayers\u201d at the table. So there\u2019s a bit of a power dynamic game there based on how much gold you have. But that dynamic has obviously shifted in today\u2019s world, that we could argue that gold is not seen as that important even though central banks of today \u2014 some of them \u2014 still hold gold, right?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [21:54]: Ownership of gold is pretty important because obviously central banks still own it. And it\u2019s still the one monetary asset that is free from any incumbrance \u2014 well, up until Bitcoin came along \u2014 it was the only monetary asset. It had that. So it\u2019s still kind of a big deal, obviously. But to be fair, I think it\u2019s really more about who is able to command an international settlement network, really. That\u2019s ultimately what it comes down to. If you\u2019re able to secure physically an international settlement network, if you\u2019re able to secure a settlement banking network that allows people to transact across borders, if you have the security over that, then it ultimately doesn\u2019t even matter if you run it on gold tokens or if you run it on fiat tokens. I guess it\u2019s not accurate to say that \u2014 it does matter \u2014 because ultimately, if you\u2019re running it on your own tokens, we see what happens. It has to eventually become politically motivated. Eventually it gets captured, and it\u2019s going to inevitably lead to all the problems that come with political capture of money, that have always come with political capture of money. Whereas if you had it linked to a hard asset, it would be very different. So one problem this shows us in the fiat standard is: it un-solved [reverted] the problem of money, in a sense. Because it prevents us from having this one monetary medium that everybody uses. This one universal medium, which is what we had with gold. At the early 20th century gold had pretty much already demonetized silver at that point, so it really was only gold. So we finally had this problem solved where everybody everywhere in the world was using one thing as money, and then fiat comes along and it introduces all these other tokens. And then there\u2019s gold \u2014 that can\u2019t be completely demonetized. And if you\u2019re looking for salability across space, if you want to spend money in the town next-door and in the country next to you and in the other continents of the world, then you\u2019re going to need some combination of various fiats. But if you want to save money for the future, if you want salability across time, if you\u2019re thinking about something that you want to keep for the future, then you end up having to think about gold. And so you have to hold some gold! And so this really un-solves [reverts] the problem of money, because now you have to \u2014 you have a much more sophisticated and complicated and error-prone calculation of: how much of my money should I allocate for salability across time \u2014 should I prioritize for the future? And how much of my money should I prioritize for the present \u2014 for salability across space, by putting it in fiat. And of course, if you live outside the US, then most likely you have to keep more than one currency in mind as well, so you end up with people having to think about gold and their local fiat currency and the dollar. It just gives everybody much more mental arithmetic to perform about money, and it makes the process of saving and the process of having a cash balance much more sophisticated and complicated than really it should be. Because if you had one form of money, it would be the one form of money that would have the best salability across space and time, and then you could just have that stash there for all your interspatial and intertemporal needs."}

The combination there of the time and space. Moving to Chapter 3 then: you\u2019ve got this idea of the underlying technology behind fiat. Can you tell us a little bit about what the fiat system looks like?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: Yeah I tried to look at fiat as a digital currency, because it is a digital currency, let\u2019s remember. Something like 90% of all fiat tokens are digital. It\u2019s only about 10% of them that get printed out on their primitive OpenDimes, which are made out of paper. It\u2019s still a digital currency, and if you start thinking about it in that sense, it\u2019s easier to make sense of how the network works. So if you think about the node in Bitcoin \u2014 what is the equivalent of the node in the fiat system? There\u2019s really only one full node in the fiat system. There\u2019s one sovereign fiat node in all the entire fiat system and it\u2019s the US Federal Reserve. And that is the only node that is able to decide definitively on the correct record of transactions and on the balances. It can revoke anybody\u2019s balance and it can add new coins to anybody\u2019s balance anywhere. They can shut off entire countries and they can take money from any account and they can cancel any transactions and so on. So it\u2019s really the Federal Reserve that\u2019s the one central node, and then there are the other nodes that are similar to SPV nodes that are the central banks. Which aren\u2019t really full nodes because they can\u2019t really truly decide the monetary supply of the token that is on the network. They can\u2019t decide the native token monetary supply. And they can\u2019t decide on the record of transactions. But they can verify payments and clear payments for people within their country. And then you have the mining nodes which are essentially any financial institution or any institution that can issue credit, that can borrow backed by the US government. These institutions are able to mine. They can\u2019t decide on the record of transactions, but they can mine. They\u2019re not full nodes, but they are mining nodes because they make new money. That\u2019s really the key analytical tool of this book, is that when you start thinking about what it means when you substitute the process of mining in Bitcoin with the process of lending. In Bitcoin you do proof of work in order to make new coins \u2014 to make new satoshis you need to do proof of work. In fiat you need to lend. You need to make a loan in order to make new coins."}

Now the government imposes all sorts of conditions and regulations and so on, on those banks and those financial institutions that are able to create new credit, but it is a massive power for them. There\u2019s a whole convoluted operation around this, right? Because it\u2019s not just \u2014 they sort of mask it with these different terms and processes around that. How would you talk about that obscuring of what\u2019s really going on?"}

And so it means that there\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s not really easy to figure just how much money there is! The money supply is not very clear, because you never really know much credit is being created, and you never really know \u2014 and of course there\u2019s the issue of the maturity of different types of monies and what can count as money and what can\u2019t count as money. So supply is completely for most people. It\u2019s very hard to come up with a clear answer about what the supply is and there\u2019s different definitions."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [32:51]: Exactly! Yes. This is the key \u2014 the way that it just ends up. Which is why, the more that [you] read into this book, the more you realize that this is just \u2014 you see the technological underpinnings and the technological realities that create the incentives for these things to happen! And it makes it really look far less nefarious! It\u2019s not like \u2014 there are serious incentives for doing this because of the way that the system works. Once you have this guarantee of debt, it just becomes more profitable for you to get into debt, because every time you get into debt for something, you\u2019re allowing the person who\u2019s lending you \u2014 the financial institution that is lending you \u2014 you\u2019re allowing them to mine new tokens. And so think about it this way: when you\u2019re buying a house, you have the choice of either just buy a house, or buy a house and mine new fiat tokens. Imagine if that happened with Bitcoin: you can just buy a house with Bitcoin, or you can buy the house with somebody else\u2019s Bitcoin, and by buying a house with somebody else\u2019s Bitcoin, they get to mine new Bitcoin. They bring new Bitcoin about! Which one of these things do you think is going to be cheaper? Obviously the second one is going to be cheaper in real terms because the lender has an incentive to make it cheaper for you \u2014 they would like you to do that \u2014 because if you don\u2019t do that and you buy the house in cash, they don\u2019t get to make new tokens!"}

It\u2019s just the reality of the incentives that everybody faces. And in a sense, you could think about it as being a conspiracy in some way, but really the more you think the technological incentives there, you see why it makes sense from an economic perspective. In this kind of system is makes sense to get into more debt. In this system the people who succeed the most, the companies who succeed the most, are ones who are able to take on the most debt, while skirting the line of profitability, and not sinking into bankruptcy! That\u2019s really the key! You just need to keep on running up a bigger loan and going from one loan to the other, and the key to do that is to have enough cash flow to continue to make your payments so you continue to make sure that your credit [inaudible 36:08] increases so that\u2019ll allow you to grow in size. This is just how the system ends up working! You can see how it just makes sense once you made it so that it is a financial system that is guaranteed by the government, it\u2019s just going to end up being this way, even though it\u2019s motivated by what sounds like such good idea \u2014 let\u2019s just guarantee the banking system and prevent it from collapsing because you wouldn\u2019t want people to lose their savings!

But until then, they can decide to go in and buy from this producer, not buy from that producer. They can decide what happens to \u2014 they can decide to allocate credits to one kind of producers and not the other, and that will completely shape the shape of the markets! It\u2019s an enormous amount of power that they are allowed to allocate. And it\u2019s massively distortionary of the market process, and that\u2019s the thing that I focus on in the second part of the book, Fiat Life. Trying to think of the downstream economic, social, political, and cultural effects of this kind of system, wherein, A) you\u2019re losing the hardness of money, so money is now much easier than gold. And you know with varying degrees across the world but still easier than gold no doubt about it. And B) on the other hand you\u2019re also having this massive distortionary effect on markets where one monopoly entity can just come in and allocate infinite amounts of cash at any producer or consumer in the market."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: Having studied this history, I really think the start of World War I \u2014 and the abandonment of the gold standard \u2014 marked really a very pivotal point in history. Because if your country had adopted industrialization and the gold standard, which usually came hand in hand \u2014 by the time you had a gold standard, you needed a gold standard because you had developed enough of the division of labor that you were importing and exporting so much that your producers needed something like a gold standard \u2014 so once a country had a gold standard and became industrialized, that country will have developed a basic industrial base and have sound money. After World War I happened, if your country had not done that by then \u2014 these countries became the developing world, more or less\u2014 these countries had not developed enough industrial capacity and had not imported enough of the modern technologies of the industrial revolution by the early 20th, and were still agrarian economies \u2014 after 1914, there would be no more gold standard for them to trade with the rest of the world, and world trade would just get messed up, so they never managed to get to that level of industrialization and that was a massive impediment in their development."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely. It\u2019s completely detrimental if you\u2019re not able to have a sound money. If you think about it, the countries that didn\u2019t develop industrially by the early 20th century, they spent the rest of the 20th century \u2014 most of them \u2014 going through one financial crisis and one hyperinflation and high inflation, all of these coming one after the other all throughout the last century or so. These countries that didn\u2019t develop this monetary tradition of sound money and didn\u2019t adopt industrialization just \u2014 by the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s when they were trying to industrialize the world was so massively protected. And protectionism had increased so much \u2014 and protectionism had started to increase after World War I precisely because of the monetary problems caused by going off the gold standard. There was very little problem with trade before World War I because when they were on the gold standard, nobody had balance of payments problems. If people bought a lot of things from abroad they lost gold and the other country made more gold and carried on! You had more stuff they had more gold, or the other way around. And if you wanted more gold, stop buying stuff! If you want more stuff, stop hoarding gold! It was a simple economic decision that everybody had. But once the currencies became disconnected from gold and prices domestically started to vary and governments tried to keep the currencies nominally at the same interest rates, you would get a difference in real prices across countries, which would lead to large movements of capital and goods and trade changes. So for somebody, the pound was overvalued after World War I for instance, and because the pound is overvalued, the British are trying to get their gold out of Britain as much as they can because it would be profitable for them to just sell it in the US and get dollars for it and then exchange the dollars in London. And then the same thing happens with trade. The country that has an undervalued currency finds its goods becoming more and more attractive for foreigners and so started exporting more, and a country with an overvalued currency doesn\u2019t export and that causes problems for its producers. And so the whole thing leads to problems in trade and that leads to tariffs and all these restrictions on trade, which then really hamper the ability of the developing world to catch up, because they hadn\u2019t grown \u2014 they didn\u2019t have a gold standard, and they didn\u2019t have access to world markets. And world markets weren\u2019t open as they used to be. I think the transfer of technology that we could\u2019ve had if we had stayed on the gold standard after 1914 would have been much much much larger. The developing world would have been in a much better shape if the gold standard had continued and would have been able to buy and sell. Because industrialization was spreading all around the world and engines were going everywhere and electricity was going up everywhere. World War I comes along and the gold standard falls and the whole thing goes to shit."}

It\u2019s quite amazing even in places like Lebanon, people just continue to maintain faith in this. I remember I was speaking to a group from Lebanon a few months ago when the Lira had lost something like 60\u201370% of its value at that time against the US dollar in just 6\u20137 months, and after presenting Bitcoin and the case for Bitcoin and the supply and all of that stuff, one of the first questions I got was, well without a central bank what guarantees the value of Bitcoin? From somebody living in Lebanon who just saw their central bank guaranteed currency lose 60\u201370% of its value, they still think of the central bank as being the reason that their currency is guaranteed to have value! They think that without the central bank, we wouldn\u2019t be able to have money and the money wouldn\u2019t be able to have value. The central bank messed up now \u2014 reasons happened \u2014 and now the currency has slipped up, but you know, things like that can happen to the best of us! And they\u2019ll maintain it now at the new exchange rate!"}

I remember teaching macroeconomics in Lebanon and coming across these lines in the macroeconomics textbook about government bonds being risk-free. I would laugh in class and would tell the students this is not true! There is no way that you can make something risk-free, let alone the bonds of your government! The government that had managed to destroy a power grid and un-invent electricity! It\u2019s not risk-free! Definitely not risk-free lending! But it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s a mental construct that just has to emerge around fiat money where the government propaganda creates this idea that this thing is risk-free and everybody believes in it. It continues to work until it doesn\u2019t work. But there was never really a good reason to suspect it works. And fortunately with Bitcoin there\u2019s never really a good reason to have to deal with it or have to believe it because now we have an option to exit from it and that\u2019s the beautiful thing about Bitcoin!"}

You don\u2019t make progress by figuring out why anybody in government shouldn\u2019t get paid. You make your progress by figuring out reasons for people to get paid. And so there\u2019s always reasons to be afraid and panicky and hysterical about things that can be alleviated by government spending. And there are always jobs to be had for people who will wear a suit and look serious while they explain why money needs to keep continuing to be printed. That\u2019s just how it works! This is ultimately what has happened with academia now. Professor Larry White has done research on this, I think he found somewhere between 70\u201390% of all research done in monetary economics journals has got the funding of the Federal Reserve somewhere. You know, one of the authors has gotten Fed bucks directly from the Fed. Fresh cantillion digital tokens straight into their bank account! Virgin coins as they say!"}

Because that we is made up for some people who are going to spend today, and some people are going to have to pay it back tomorrow! And that\u2019s just not the same people! The people getting to spend today are the economists with a fake job that tells you that debt is good for your children. And the people who are paying his salary are your children!

But the thing is a lot of these economists just like our friend Paul Krugman and the Paul Krugmans of the world who will come out and tell us, Oh no, see!

And somebody needs to consume them and somebody\u2019s going to have to provide them. And all the emotional bullshit in the world can\u2019t hide behind that! That\u2019s the scam of fiat. Basically everybody\u2019s being enslaved to their future self. Or everybody is enslaving their future self, I should say. You\u2019re putting your future self in debt for yourself, for you to be able to spend tomorrow. And everybody is stuck in that. The sad thing about it \u2014 well it\u2019s not very sad \u2014 you have to stay on this treadmill even as you start getting more money. It\u2019s not like the rich people can just\u2014 well I mean they can obviously \u2014 but if they just opt out of the system they would be giving up on serious wealth. Whereas if they just take on more debt, then they\u2019ll be able to essentially beat inflation. So everybody has an incentive to stay on the treadmill. Everybody has an incentive to stay indebted. Everybody has an incentive to continue to live with a relatively close margin to economic problems and economic hardships and massive financial instability in their lives because everything is running on debt, everything is fragile, a couple of mispaid checks and business goes bad and you lose the business. So this kind of stress takes its toll on people, and the way that the fiat system works is that the only way that you can opt out of this \u2014 no matter how much money you have \u2014 is through giving up on significant money. If you don\u2019t get into debt, you\u2019re being the sucker of the inflation game. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s financing everybody else\u2019s mining."}

You look at it all over and you start realizing that for small businesses and for large businesses, one of the most important components of success is knowing how to manage debt. And managing debt successfully \u2014 particularly for large businesses \u2014 basically debt arbitrage, interest rate arbitrage. This is what large companies do. Many large companies are essentially hedge funds today. If you think about what IBM does \u2014 IBM\u2019s a hedge fund! They are big enough that they can get cheaper credit than pretty much anyone, and they invest very far and very wide and that\u2019s ultimately more of their business I think at this point than anything else! So really managing debt and managing the process of creating debt and borrowing and lending is the key to success. Which I think is quite wasteful! Because if you had had an advanced monetary system like Bitcoin you\u2019d just have computers doing the slave work! It wouldn\u2019t have to be mining every day by getting into debt and worrying about our finances and worrying about missing two paychecks and becoming homeless and so on. You wouldn\u2019t have this insecurity with your house with your job \u2014 all of this fragility \u2014 because you\u2019re having to mine. You\u2019ll just have computers doing the mining!

Almost some of the most recent news with Microstrategy deciding to issue debt to buy Bitcoin, obviously our friend Pierre Rochard who spoke about this and wrote about this in 2014 \u2014 in some ways it\u2019s almost like a real validation or a vindication of that strategy \u2014 that because as you were saying it was about managing your debt, but now that the world is slowly, we think, monetizing into Bitcoin, it\u2019s almost like a validation of that idea wouldn\u2019t you say?"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/WIgdENe2GKg", "title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "text": "Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely! When you think about the fiat standard, when I studied it, my conclusion is that, Yeah, try and get into as much debt as you can! Try and get as much Bitcoin as you can! That\u2019s really the winning way of playing this game, because Bitcoin is a hard asset, they can\u2019t make more of it, but they can make more fiat. So if you\u2019re playing the fiat game, if you\u2019re able to get debt, you\u2019re able to get ahead with it, unfortunately. But if you\u2019re able to secure with Bitcoin \u2014 the incredible thing is that now we have the entrepreneurial opportunity to bootstrap the alternative to the debt-based system. Instead of having to continue to monetize debt and continue to live in this world where everybody has to get into debt, and everybody has to mine debt in order to continue to function economically, you can start monetizing a hard asset. And you monetize this hard asset by holding Bitcoin and are effectively rewarded for this entrepreneurial bet on Bitcoin through the significant amount of NgU technology that is happening. The rise in the price of Bitcoin is the entrepreneurial call being successful. This thing is rising, and it shows that the value of this monetary system is increasing. As this continues to go up, we have the alternative to that! That\u2019s the lesson. In the long run, I think one plausible attack vector you could think about is that there would be some kind of separation where you can\u2019t buy Bitcoin if you get into fiat debt or vice versa. This might be one way that they begin to fight back to try and prevent this kind of thing, but otherwise, it\u2019s really exciting to watch this going on as long as it can! Because, you know, Godspeed to Michael Saylor as he continues to see just how much of the fiat of Wall Street he can get into the soundness of Bitcoin!"}

Not everybody can borrow at cheap interest rates for this purpose. Perhaps for the typical individual they can get a loan for something like a house for a relatively low rate, but not necessarily to get Bitcoin at the same rate. Of course, people will find ways and there will probably be people doing this kind of thing. As you were mentioning it\u2019s about being responsible in how people are doing it as well because there certainly are a lot cases where people go into debt and try these kinds of high leverage strategies and end up getting rekt. Let\u2019s just make sure listeners aren\u2019t thinking, Oh yeah! Let\u2019s just maximize \u2014 it is certainly a risk also."}

I\u2019m really psyched to talk to you! You\u2019re very influential on my understanding or coming to grips with Bitcoin. I was revisiting your work\u2014because I\u2019ve kept up with your stuff since 2017 for the most part, and there\u2019s so much to cover \u2014 but when I was revisiting your work, there were a couple things that really stood out to me, maybe because of who I am? One, you\u2019re an educator, and two you\u2019re a goal-setter. You achieve goals. And you\u2019ve contributed to Bitcoin Core. And I think about those three things, and we can go into why those things stick out to me. But my question to you is: Bitcoin changes you is an expression. You can\u2019t change Bitcoin \u2014 it changes you! And I was thinking about that and it\u2019s relation to you, and your work that you\u2019ve put out. And when you speak, I kind of hear, like, Bitcoin Core! I kind of hear, like, the voice from the inside! It was even striking to me how you alliterate your articles! And your writing. And I wonder, how did Bitcoin change you, and do you think working on Bitcoin Core changed you differently than maybe people who learn about Bitcoin from a very different lens? Because I think, Well, maybe Bitcoin\u2019s changing me from the outside in? But maybe Bitcoin changed you from the inside out? I\u2019m not sure!"}

I would say that Bitcoin has changed me in a lot of ways. But it\u2019s part of I think just coming into maturity just as a man, and Bitcoin was a part of that process. I\u2019m 44 years old, and when I started this journey I was 35 or something like that. You know, I have kids and everything, and part of coming to terms with having a family and trying to provide for my family and things like that brought certain questions to my mind, especially after 2008. About, How am I going to prep for their future? And things like that. Because it was clear to me after 2008 that this system was extremely fragile. And when I saw Bitcoin, when I found out about it, I think it really struck a chord with me in large part because of what I was looking for, which was a good place to park my money, actually! To invest and put something towards the future! And that sort of low time preference, long term time orientation kind of view, that\u2019s what really struck me about Bitcoin, and that\u2019s something that has been developed in me as a result of Bitcoin. Not the least of which is Bitcoin itself! I put out a Tweet the other day, I used to love shopping for bargains! I\u2019d go all the websites for the bargain deals and I\u2019d feel awesome when I\u2019d get something like $100 less than what everyone else paid for it, or whatever. I mean I used to do like the crazy rebate games and stuff like that, I\u2019d get things for free and sell them on Craigslist afterwards. Just all kinds of stupid crap like that! And realizing that most of that is stupid! Because in a sense, when you have Bitcoin, which stores value really well, you\u2019re not going to go and buy needless crap, because if you just wait a little longer, you\u2019re gonna get something much better! And you\u2019re gonna get it for a much better price, because in terms of Bitcoin, those things are all going down in price. I would say the main way in which Bitcoin\u2019s changed me is a part of coming into maturity, part of who I\u2019m becoming, and that\u2019s just having a lower time preference, thinking much more about the long term, and things like that."}

I learn to be pretty introspective as a programmer, you have to analyze things. A lot of people don\u2019t believe me when I say this about being a programmer: it\u2019s actually very emotional! Especially when a project you\u2019ve been working on 24/7 for three months gets cut and then you have to come to terms with the fact that you worked on something that no one\u2019s gonna use or whatever. Or you work on something and a lot more people like it, even though it took you five minutes. Like that was a critical thing for them, or something like that! There\u2019s a lot of \u2014 that internal, emotional management aspect of it is something I did have at least a little bit of through my experience in programming. But I would be lying if I said that I had really good self-control at the same place I am now, nine years ago. That just wasn\u2019t the case! The thing that changed with Bitcoin was that I started to recognize what it really meant to save. And what it really meant to be able to put off till later \u2014 you know, let some things go! Instead of wanting things Now now now. I\u2019ve always sort of been a little bit that way anyway, with the exception of a few things, but this really encouraged it and put the better angel of my nature in charge, rather than the devil of wanting things now. And I would say that those two worked in sync and I\u2019ve been able to save a lot more \u2014 recently \u2014 because of the things that developed as a result of being in Bitcoin."}

But I would say that there is a sense in which I\u2019ve learned to moderate some of my emotions. But that\u2019s more a result of getting more attention on Twitter and so on, and less Bitcoin. That\u2019s just something I learned as a result of \u2014 like, 2013, nobody knew who I was but I was on Twitter and I was Tweeting about Bitcoin. I\u2019d get like 3 likes and people would argue with me and I would get really angry and say nasty things! All kinds of stuff like that! In a sense, going through those early was a real blessing because I learned to recognize, Okay, most people won\u2019t change their mind on a public forum in any way, shape, or form. And second, you can let them win a little! It\u2019s okay! If somebody gets the last word in, let them get that little win, and you\u2019ll be \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna hurt you any. You may think it does, but it doesn\u2019t! Most people aren\u2019t gonna see those comments, and the people that do are gonna think less of the people that made those comments than the response that you gave.

Because I was just like \u2014 one of the things that I recognized was like, my opinions in large ways were beholden to my company! The company that I was working for! And in subtle ways, and in more overt ways, but my mind wasn\u2019t my own when I was working for them! The golden handcuffs of salary, they consume your soul in some ways! And the ability to detach from that, to have my own voice and to say whatever the hell I feel like. You know, just have my own thing going \u2014 that was enormously freeing! And you\u2019re probably right, that definitely had an effect on my perspective and maybe how I come across and things like that. You go to a conference and you listen to a speaker that\u2019s shilling their latest altcoin or whatever, and then you hear somebody like Tone Vays speak, it\u2019s a completely different experience, because one is obviously working for somebody, and they\u2019re being sycophants to whoever is giving them the money. But when you tell the truth with the conviction of real belief, it makes a big difference! And it comes across a different way! You have a different impact on people, and I think maybe that\u2019s the main thing that I\u2019ve gotten out of going off on my own into this Bitcoin entrepreneur journey."}

I really want to touch on this: middle of 2017 \u2014 my first question there is, How much do you think going from that beholden point where you work for someone else, to being your freer person. At that moment in time, does your voice get more clear and chiseled? Or are you literally just releasing thoughts that have been pent up? I think that there\u2019s like a fork in the road that you almost can\u2019t have certain thoughts until you\u2019ve left those binds!"}

It really was kind of like that! There\u2019s like a barrier, you can\u2019t express yourself fully because you\u2019re tied in golden handcuffs or something. You don\u2019t have that freedom of movement, the freedom of thought. And you could kind of see this in my writing too. In 2017 \u2014 the first half of 2017\u2014I was trying to be conciliatory to all sides, trying to calm people down, try to thread the needle in between and say, Hey, you know what? I\u2019m this neutral person and everything else. And you can see in the second half of 2017 I started getting my own voice and saying \u2014 instead of writing what people wanted to hear, I started writing what I really thought! And that made all of the difference! People want to think what it is that you think for the reasons that you think it, instead of whatever the company line may be, or whatever might make them feel better. As much as people like things that make them feel better, it doesn\u2019t connect at a level that real truth does! So I think that was the main thing. It wasn\u2019t a lot of pent up stuff. I think to a degree, a large part of my \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like water that you\u2019re swimming in, you don\u2019t really recognize that your opinions are beheld that way, and that you\u2019re being moderate because you\u2019re put into a political position at your workplace that you didn\u2019t sign up for but you nevertheless have to play. It wasn\u2019t like that as it was like\u2014being free from that \u2014 my mind could now go wherever it wanted! I have always thought of myself as somebody that sought truth, and that\u2019s where it led me. That\u2019s ultimately I think what led me to write a lot of those things that I did. It seemed to connect really well with Bitcoin Twitter and so on."}

Is it gonna be like, I\u2019m gonna buy a car-wash and I\u2019ll give you 10% equity and $60,000 a year to work there for me and work your way through the equity ladder?

The best thing that I\u2019ve come up with is just give them the tools to succeed, and then see what they want to do, and don\u2019t let fear get in the way of their trying things. Because to me, the hardest hurdle to overcome\u2014the month and a half where I was pondering whether or not I should go off on my own \u2014 it was getting over that fear! It kind of sounds silly right now that it took me a month and a half to get over that fear, but that\u2019s what it took. Literally every night just thinking, Oh okay. If I do this, okay. And I made lists and said, Okay here are the pros, here are the cons, here is the worst case scenario, here\u2019s blah blah blah. And ultimately \u2014 at some point you have to move! You have to do something! You have to take a step! After I took that step it was like, What the hell was I worried about? Navigating the free market and finding a product that other people will find interesting and will pay for isn\u2019t this crazy difficult thing that they make it out to be! I\u2019ve been absolutely shocked at some of the things that I\u2019ve been able to sell to people, and oftentimes they\u2019ll come to me and ask me for it! And I was like, Hey, I didn\u2019t even know that this was something that you\u2019d want, but okay! I\u2019ve done it for you, now lets go do it for like 30 other people. And you make a bunch of money! In a sense, that\u2019s the mentality that I would love to instill in my kids and give them that sense that the world\u2019s your oyster! It\u2019s not something to be afraid of, you just need to have certain skills to be able to navigate it. But you don\u2019t need to be beholden to a company because in many ways, that would probably be one of the worst outcomes that I could imagine. Which is that they go to a company and sort of live out their existence in \u201cquiet desperation\u201d to quote Thoreau. That would be the worst possibility for me! I would want them to live and take risks and break things and try something and fail! That\u2019s when you actually learn things! And I gotta tell you! I\u2019ve failed in a bunch of things since the middle of 2017. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of things and was like, Yeah, that\u2019s not gonna work. I was able to fail quickly and learn from it. And other things it was like, Hey, this works! And it works for a certain amount of time. That\u2019s what I would like to instill is: that sense of entrepreneurship, of risk-taking, of this mandate to actually add something to the world, not by doing what someone tells you but by using your own mind and creativity and skills to find some piece of the market that needs something that you can fulfill."}

Do you want them to be programmers and coders? That seems like a way, in my mind, for people to be Bitcoin cashflow sovereign, or something like being a voice, but that\u2019s really hard to do without a skillset or a background or experiences to fall on. Like I don\u2019t want my a 20-year-old influencer on YouTube per say, even though he\u2019s dying to be one of these YouTube stars playing video games and making videos games and showing people how to do it.

Like being able to put up a drywall or weld something or fix a car. All those things are just extremely useful skills. And combining them in interesting ways and figuring out holes in the market, needs in the market that you can fulfill, that\u2019s really the main thing to teach, for me, is that ability to find a need in the market that you can fulfill, and then go do it and market it in a proper way so that you get some business. That to me is way more effective than learning a set skill. Like, programming is kind of a unique skill in that it can be fitted towards lots and lots of different things, but most jobs in the economy are not like that! They\u2019re very much cookie-cutter, and it\u2019s like, Oh, we need an accountant, and we need a lawyer, and whatever. All of those things have very specific credentials around them and things like that. I get why they need to exist, but they\u2019re not, at least for me, that creative, or that fulfilling. My kids might think differently! And I\u2019m open to seeing how they see the world! To a degree, to get the best match for your skills and passions and whatever makes money \u2014 to get the best fit for that, you need to go out into the market yourself and not go into a cookie-cutter role that they ask for in the marketplace. That would be my main lesson to teach them."}

You\u2019re an educator! It really comes through and it\u2019s very effective! You had a blog post\u2014I think it was in 2019 \u2014 My Story of Setting Goals. It\u2019s just one of these things that\u2019s so simple, but in my view, very honest. Because you\u2019re sharing your story and your achievements, and a lot of people are very selfish with those things. They don\u2019t want to share what they were thinking when, and what they accomplished, and the sauce. And inspire others, maybe. You wrote, Back in May of 2017 I had just broken 1,000 followers on Twitter. Now you got something like over 180,000 followers on Twitter. And you outline here, I\u2019m gonna write some goals. And you wrote down some goals in 2017 when you had 1,000 followers. And you wrote down, I want to be a keynote to a conference, travel to five continents and do something Bitcoin related, create my own business and write a book, and you put it on a 5-year horizon which I think is fantastic! It\u2019s what Pierre Rochard talks a little bit about on the show \u2014 humans thinking a little bit more longer term. And you banged these things out in 18 months!"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/dh1Noe62OwU", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #18 \u2014 Jimmy Song: The Bitcoin Professor", "text": "Jimmy Song [24:49]: Yeah! And that was an absolute shocker to me! That I was able to do that in 18 months! And if you want some tips on goal setting, there\u2019s a really cool Jordan Peterson goal setting workshop that I use to actually set those goals. And basically he just asks you a bunch of questions and you answer them as honestly as possible, and that\u2019s how I came up with those goals. And yeah, did I think I would achieve them in 18 months? Absolutely not! Did I even think that I was going to be able to achieve them in 5 years? Absolutely not! But it came in large part because goals have that effect where, you notice opportunities that fit your goals because you have them. Because you\u2019re focused on the endpoint, you\u2019re able to see how opportunities that you might have now can fit towards those goals! And I think that\u2019s definitely what happened! About two months after that I went off on my own and started my own business teaching programmers, and a couple months after this I got invited to my first conference and lo and behold they wanted me to keynote the first day! I was the very first speaker on the first day of that conference. And it was a brand new conference, I was like, I haven\u2019t really spoken before but okay! Alright, this is what I wanted! So I ended up doing that. A month after that a friend of mine approached me about writing a book together, and then we explored things, and he wanted to drop out so it ended up being me, and I ended up getting a contract with O\u2019Reilly to write a book. Not The Little Bitcoin book, but the Programming Bitcoin book. That ended up happening. You know, and I got invited to different conferences and I was like, Okay, let\u2019s see where it is. And it ended up that I did travel to five continents! All of those things happened because I was looking for those opportunities and I had some goals in mind! I think goal setting is absolutely crucial if you want to get some things done. I have different goals now. We\u2019ll see how those come to pass! But yeah, I\u2019m a big believer in how much the goals actually focus you towards them. And they almost call out to you and draw you to them like magnets. It\u2019s a worthwhile exercise to do, even if it\u2019s scary emotionally, which it is for most people."}

A lot of people listening to these workshops, the Jordan Peterson one included \u2014 you talked about these magnets. You put the goal out there and it becomes this magnet. But I think it\u2019s hard for a lot of people to be honest with themselves?"}

It\u2019s okay to want things \u2014 that\u2019s the big thing that I think a lot of people feel guilty about. It\u2019s like, Well I want fame and I want money and I want these things. It\u2019s okay to want those things! If you\u2019re honest about it that\u2019s okay! The thing I\u2019ve found is that oftentimes your perspective on those very things changes as you go closer towards them and you might not want them anymore! You mentioned your son wants to be a YouTube influencer showing people how to plan video games and so on, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s watching right now. I bet you after he finds out what their lives are really like in a few years, his perspective will change. And he\u2019ll say, You know what Dad? Maybe that\u2019s not for me! You have to play video games like 14 hours a day to get really good at it in order to be able to show it, and you have to have really good video skills and speaking skills and I tried public speaking and I\u2019m not very good at it, blah blah blah. So there\u2019s a lot of those kinds of things that can correct your path, and you might not want those things anymore, at which point, you can reset your goals. I feel like when I set those goals I was old enough at least know myself enough to know that those were within reach within five years. Those were things that I could do that were concrete, that weren\u2019t abstract, not knowing ever whether I ever actually reached those goals or not. The actual desire is okay to have. That\u2019s something that you kind of have to give yourself permission to have, and say, Alright, it\u2019s okay for me to want this in five years. I might change \u2014 you always leave yourself the out that, Hey, that\u2019s not what I want, and I\u2019m okay with not achieving that particular goal and I can go do something else. I guess that has to do with something like your perception of yourself versus who you really are, because a lot of people want to be somebody that they\u2019re not! Or they perceive themselves to be somebody that they\u2019re not! And being honest with yourself is hard for that reason. This is where having a spouse can be really, really helpful! It certainly was for me! Having her tell me her perspective of me definitely changed my perspective of me, and that helped me to set clear goals and be more honest with myself."}

The main thing that I learned is that people can learn really fast if they\u2019re motivated. So I learned something about education. If you read my book it\u2019s like a semester\u2019s worth of information, and I literally taught it over a semester at the University of Texas. So I know it can take a long time if you want it to. But I did these seminars in two days, and it was eight hours a day, two days. These people are paying me a lot of money and so they\u2019re very motivated to learn. And amazingly, they got almost all of it in two days! Which was amazing to me that they could! But that\u2019s the power of human effort, and that\u2019s the power of desire and things like that! And I look at the education system today and I\u2019m like, This is completely broken! Because if these people can learn in two days what took me really like a couple of years \u2014 the education system is what is wrong! They\u2019re not properly motivated, or it\u2019s not presented the right way, or whatever. There\u2019s plenty of really smart people that can get things really, really quickly! And I\u2019m sure you know of coding boot camps and things like that? It\u2019s six weeks and then they come out of it paid six-figures at a pretty decent company. That\u2019s the path that they\u2019re on, and six weeks of training is all that they need to get to that point where they can do something like that! That\u2019s the first thing that I learned, is that people are very willing to learn if they are motivated to do so! The other thing that I learned is that there\u2019s a lot of people that get motivated by other people. I have pretty much the same material in my book, and you can definitely work through it. The typical length of time it takes for somebody to actually work through the entire book with all of the exercises and everything is a few months. But I\u2019m able to do this in two days! Part of it is me pushing them. Just, I\u2019m gonna go fast and you better keep up, otherwise you\u2019re not gonna get value out of it. But the other part of it is that, there\u2019s sort of like what I would call the CrossFit effect \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever been in CrossFit, just the fact that somebody next to you is doing reps that you\u2019re not doing makes you feel terrible! And that motivates you to do the reps, even if you don\u2019t feel like it! And that\u2019s the dynamic in a classroom that I realized really works in everyone\u2019s favor. When you have competition and this sense of keeping up, it can be a very powerful force for learning. So those would be the two things that I\u2019d say I learned about."}

Alright, I\u2019ll teach them, and then they went back. I also had a bunch of Bitcoin HODLers that knew a little bit about programming that wanted to learn more about the protocol so they could learn more about their investment. I had college students, and I had octogenarians! I had people all over the spectrum. I actually had a few high school students. In fact, I had a 14-year-old girl that won a scholarship \u2014 so pretty smart girl \u2014 that managed to take the course and keep up with the rest of the class, which absolutely shocked me!

Do you ever pick up something very quickly about students as you\u2019re teaching them. You maybe sense who\u2019s picking it up or who\u2019s getting it? And this question is kind of phrased in two ways: how much of coding \u2014 whether someone\u2019s in your course \u2014 how much of it is art versus science? Or a combination, and some people are better at one or the other? Like I could write code and get what you need done, versus maybe Satoshi \u2014 and I\u2019m trying to paraphrase what you wrote \u2014 wasn\u2019t the best coder ever?

Once in a while you\u2019ll just see a student that\u2019s asking these very precise questions, and you\u2019re like, Okay! That person is going places! If they\u2019re asking that, that means they know all of this other stuff. And they have a grasp of it that\u2019s even better than mine. There\u2019s certainly those one-off geniuses that you encounter in class \u2014 every educator has met them! And you can always tell, usually by the quality of the question. But there are also others that are more silent and introverted and they get it, but you never identify it until much later. And that I usually find out by what happens afterwards! What companies they get hired by and so on. I think I have students at pretty much every major Bitcoin company that exists! Like, they clearly know something and can do things that I didn\u2019t identify while I was teaching them. There is a lot of that. I would say that the creativity, the art of it, comes from understanding. I think Satoshi could have written a better client, if Satoshi had more programming experience. But the fact that Satoshi got so much of it right is actually more impressive than the parts that he got wrong, because those are sort of the mistakes that you would expect somebody that wasn\u2019t quite as familiar with what you would call enterprise-grade coding, or open source level coding, that you expect from the bigger projects and so on. So I think they\u2019re both very related. It\u2019s great to see \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I call them my kids too \u2014 when your kids do something really cool."}

Satoshi was no longer the point person to make all the decisions. Instead, it became a decentralized project. Nothing else comes close to doing anything like that! And that was a key thing, I think. And anyone that\u2019s observed this space kind of knows what that really means \u2014 it\u2019s that, this is not a normal person that would do something like that, because it takes a lot of selflessness. None of those coins have moved, and there\u2019s a lot of them, and we know that Satoshi was a cypherpunk, so there\u2019s little to no chance that those keys aren\u2019t backed up, but there\u2019s a significant amount of virtue inherent in Satoshi to be able to do that!

And completely burned their reputations on them, which is kind of sad! I think the one OG that\u2019s not like that is maybe Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, but that\u2019s about it!"}

That\u2019s more of less what they\u2019ve tried to do. A lot of the non-technical OGs came in from sort of an investment standpoint, not as sort of like changing the story of the store of value, or something like that. They instead came in thinking, Oh this is a good investment! I picked the winner! I\u2019m going to be able to pick other winners. They get kind of an ego about it. And I think that\u2019s where their downfall is, in thinking that they are bigger than Bitcoin itself. We\u2019ve seen this happen over and over and over again with all of these would-be saviors that are creating their own coin and saying, This is the new thing. We\u2019re going to be Facebook to Bitcoin\u2019s Myspace. Bitcoin is the Model T and I\u2019m a Lambroghini. These are all arguments by analogy and so on. Ultimately, they believe that they can do better than Satoshi did. And that\u2019s the fatal flaw to a large degree. Because the biggest thing that Satoshi did was leave! And give up the throne, if you will. And that\u2019s something these guys aren\u2019t willing to do. In that sense it\u2019s a sad commentary on their motivations. They end up there because \u2014 if you\u2019re an investor and you make a lot of money, you\u2019re going to have an ego. That\u2019s just a fact. That\u2019s how you keep score in that world. For a technical person it\u2019s not quite like that. You keep score a different way so you\u2019re not as susceptible to that particular thing, so I suspect that\u2019s why programmers haven\u2019t been as susceptible to that as non-technical OGs have."}

I don\u2019t need to tell any of your listeners that. From a Bitcoin standpoint, Bitcoin crashed with the market, and then it recovered way faster! And the market\u2019s been recovering really fast, so it\u2019s even faster than that. So it\u2019s been kind of a crazy year. I would say the halving was the big event that happened in May, and that was something that everyone anticipated, but the supply shock that came as a result of that hasn\u2019t really worked itself through the market, until about now. It\u2019s starting to be felt. You can see the price rising and so on. That\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s happening. Will it continue down this road and will it end I\u2019m not really sure. It does seem like there\u2019s less of a supply of Bitcoin and a heck of a lot of demand. We know that once it gets to be a frenzy it can go up really fast. That\u2019s what I\u2019m anticipating is, from a store of value standpoint, a lot more people are going to be adopting it."}

You said Bitcoin dominance at 75% at the end of the year. We\u2019re edging towards that. Taproot will be activated without much controversy \u2014 I think that sounds like a slam dunk. Bitcoin price will have a bottom to top difference of at least 100% where we got that in multiples, and halving will be the big narrative. Do you have any predictions for 2021?"}

It said 65% and I didn\u2019t anticipate all of these DeFi coins coming in, and they diluted the dominance index significantly because there were just so many of them. And Taproot looks like it won\u2019t be activated until next year so I was wrong about that. I expected it to be activated this year which it definitely won\u2019t be. 2021 I\u2019m expecting Taproot to get activated. I suspect that wallets will have a little bit of a hard time implementing all of the goodies that come out of Taproot: Schnorr signatures, aggregated multisig, MuSig and things like that. Those are not that simple, let\u2019s just say that from a technical standpoint. And there\u2019s lot of gotchas, a lot of wallet developers \u2014 they do put in a lot of time into their product, but they\u2019re also putting a lot of time into altcoins and things like that. If you want to adopt Schnorr and things, you\u2019re going to really need to focus on Schnorr and not be developing altcoin number 95 or whatever into your product. I see some tension around wallets and Schnorr and adoption and things like that. I think the industry will be adopting it, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Other things: I see the uncertainty continuing from 2020. I know that\u2019s probably not what a lot of people want to hear. That seems to be the case right now. There is a lot of uncertainty around elections and COVID and things like that. If anything, this seems to be \u2014 I hate this phrase \u2014 but the new normal. In a sense all of that is kind of good for Bitcoin, because it\u2019s the one thing that looks much more stable than everything else, and in my opinion it is more stable than everything else, in a different kind of way."}

But, oh man, I\u2019m married so it\u2019s not as bad. And I have kids so I get to hang out with them and whatever. But if I were a single person living in a major city I can\u2019t imagine how different life would be for me right now. There\u2019s just nowhere to go out. It\u2019s hard to meet people, and people are all scared and everything else! And if you\u2019re in college or something like that, the campus experience is just completely changed. If you\u2019re in high school, your school experience is very different. Even the people come out of college, they\u2019re coming into a work environment that\u2019s just completely different than what anyone else has had in the past 30 years! The social impact of what\u2019s happened is something that\u2019s going to be felt for a pretty long time. And a lot of it\u2019s going to be permanent, because Google, Twitter, Facebook, they\u2019re all like letting their employees work remotely for at least a year and so on. That\u2019s definitely going to become more normal. There\u2019s probably a lot of other things happening, and who knows what other virus might spark the public imagination in the next 18 months. So all of that is to say, there\u2019s a definite shift in mentality among the populous, so I expect that to have some downstream second order effects, at least."}

First thing, if you\u2019re a US citizen is no state income tax! That\u2019s a major one if you make any money at all, as opposed to like California which can be upwards of 10% just in terms of income taxes. That\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s also a culture of more free and libertarian thinking, which I like. Which is very different than the coasts which tend to be a lot more nanny statish. I rather have my freedom. It\u2019s a very good cost of living versus what you can make ratio, which is kind of what you want! In San Francisco, you can make a lot of money, but it also costs you an arm and a leg to live there. Kansas City is a very nice place to live but you don\u2019t have that many jobs that pay that well. So you want some combination of both. At least for me, Texas fits the bill."}

I used to read a lot of Slashdot, which is \u2014 News for Nerds was their slogan. All the developers in the 90\u2019s, the Internet geeks, this was really where all these guys hung out. And I knew about Bitcoin essentially 2011, and I read a little bit about it, and I certainly didn\u2019t grok it, but I did kind of understand that it was this anonymous Internet money. And that people were using it to buy drugs and stuff. It was interesting! But I didn\u2019t quite get it. And then, somewhere around 2013\u20132014 I was like, People are still buying drugs on the Internet with this stuff! And I tried to go on Mt. Gox and I got into the log-in, and I started to create an account, and they asked for my ID, and I was like, Oh, I thought this was an anonymous Internet currency? So I was like, Well this won\u2019t do! So I closed that window, did a little more research, and was like, Oh! An ATM! As long as it doesn\u2019t have a camera, I can obscure my face and I can get some anonymous Internet money! That\u2019s cool! So I just kind of waited, and I always looked around for them, but I guess I kind of forgot about it for a few years. I\u2019d see it come up on TV and stuff, and then 2017 \u2014 big price, the hype, right? \u2014 I was like, You know what? I\u2019m gonna take another look at this. And like many among us, I fell into the Andreas Antonopoulos rabbit hole videos, and started going pretty deep. I watched probably like a hundred of those. And then I was just like looking around for more information, I was on Reddit a bunch, and eventually I saw that you gotta get on Twitter, if you\u2019re gonna be in the Bitcoin universe! [05:05] I did that, and then I got into Austrian economics."}

Like, can you tell me what that process was like for you? How did you go from listening to Andreas to Austrian economics? Because to me that\u2019s a little bit of a leap.

I think I followed Justin Moon, he runs BUIDL Bootcamp. He teaches people how to code Bitcoin, so he put this thing out saying, I\u2019m doing an Austrian economics book club \u2014 who\u2019s in? I was just like, Oh, sure! Me! Then I met Max Hillebrand, who\u2019s amazing. I met Zane Pocock, who\u2019s really awesome if you guys don\u2019t know Zane, and I met Thibaud Mar\u00e9chal.

I was on, I think it was Reddit, and as much shit as I give Reddit, I have learned a lot from Reddit over the years, and I hate Reddit and I don\u2019t go on it these days. And I think I remember coming across a post, and it was basically like, How do I sort through all this noise? There is so much noise in crypto! This was like, early 2017, late 2016, like height of the frenzy, and somebody asked the question and was like How do I sort through all this noise? Somebody was like, Alright. What you need to do is you need to make a Twitter \u2014 and I already had a Twitter but I had only used it for like trading penny stocks, just to follow companies and P/Es and stuff \u2014 he said, Follow the people that have been in this space a really long time, cultivate a really careful Twitter feed of people that are either developers, that have been in this space a really long time and are smart and only talk about smart stuff, and then he had a list of all of his recommended people, and a lot of them were people I still follow today like Kyle Torpey, Pierre Rochard \u2014 some of them I have ended up muting, blocking, whatever. Guys like Vinny Lingham, like \u2014 get him away from me! But, yeah I had a really similar journey!

And I think this brings me to: I think one of the most important things you need to understand about this universe is that critical thinking is so paramount! Especially in the fake news era, but it always is. So if you guys aren\u2019t familiar with critical thinking, it\u2019s a very simple discipline that is quintessential to incorporating new information into your worldview. And it talks about (1) avoiding logical fallacies. So, in order to do that you need to understand logic and you need to understand what logical fallacies are and how they lead you to the incorrect conclusions and think you\u2019re correct. (2) Second thing is, absorb information from many different sources, and decide based on the validity of the arguments therein, whether or not this information is good. You may not know whether it\u2019s true or not, but how good is it? And you incorporate lots of information and they all kind of have a scale of how good they are. And on Twitter, you\u2019re not getting information from CNN or FOX News, it\u2019s from all these random people, and you just have to evaluate the information based on what it is. [09:18] In doing that, that\u2019s how you cultivate your Twitter following, like you said. You followed people, and then you unfollowed them when you realized that what they were saying wasn\u2019t prescient, or wasn\u2019t logically sound. And if you work from this foundation, then you can get to a place that\u2019s close to truth \u2014 and I use that word very loosely."}

But that\u2019s inherently impossible! Because everybody\u2019s biased in some way, shape, or form. And just because a person is biased, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong! Somebody can be extremely \u2014 me, for example, I\u2019m probably very biased for Bitcoin. But that\u2019s also because I\u2019ve done probably, at this point, hundreds if not a thousand-plus hours of research on this topic. And I am thoroughly and logically convinced through my steps through this process, through this Bitcoin spectrum \u2014 as we\u2019re gonna go over and talk about today \u2014 that I\u2019ve come to the correct conclusions, or at least I\u2019ve surrounded myself with enough smart people that they would weed out my bullshit. You know, where I would be wrong. Like, Twitter is such an amazing resource. If you cultivate, carefully, a good following, and you block people liberally who interrupt your intellectual process, it can be a really, really great place to learn! So, I want to jump into this Bitcoin spectrum. Now, this is something that you share with me \u2014 this was published by Unchained Capital, I\u2019m gonna have a link to this picture down in the show notes if you guys want to check it out, if you want to follow along visually if you\u2019re a visual learner (I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re listening to a podcast, but\u2026). If you want to follow along as we talk through this, but we want to try to hit some of the major points, because something Ben and I talked a lot about is how the Bitcoin and the blockchain spectrum is massive in scope, and if you have missing pieces, it\u2019s kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, right? If you have missing pieces on this Bitcoin spectrum, you\u2019re not gonna be able to see the whole picture, and you\u2019re really not going to be able to understand why this thing is so important, and why it\u2019s so valuable, unless you can see the big picture! Ben, do you have any thoughts on that?"}

So the spectrum \u2014 in case people aren\u2019t looking at the thing \u2014 it\u2019s four main pillars. And I don\u2019t think this graph is necessarily the end-all. It\u2019s a Venn-diagram, right? It has four main pillars, four main schools of thought, and I don\u2019t think this is the end-all, be-all of what describes Bitcoin, but it\u2019s a great start to understand how complex this topic is. There are four main bubbles on this Venn-diagram: Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, Cryptography. Really, each one of these things are very difficult to understand wholisticly \u2014 really understand them. And what we\u2019re trying to do, to understand Bitcoin, is to understand all four of these things and how they interact. And then, try to understand the paradigm of a new world with Bitcoin in it! And then understand all of those disciplines in this new paradigm, this unknown future that is in front of us. And that is a very difficult task to do I think. That\u2019s why all of us spend all this time researching and discussing and eliminating bad ideas! Right?"}

It\u2019s important to try to take a very praxeological approach to this spectrum in understanding that there aren\u2019t really any hard and fast rules here. All we can really do is observe human action, try to anticipate the way that we think this is gonna play out, and that\u2019s where the whole game theory thing comes into it. And look at each spectrum as broadly as possible, and then dig as deeply into Bitcoin as we can, and try to understand where we think this thing is gonna go! And I think that that\u2019s what a lot of really smart people have done.

In case you guys missed it, the four pillars are Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, and Cryptography. So we\u2019re gonna start, and we\u2019re gonna talk about the economics first. We\u2019re gonna touch on some of the points there. And then we\u2019re gonna make our way through the other pillars to give you a broad overview of all of the things that go into this system. So first and foremost we have the economics piece. Ben, what are your initial thoughts when you think of the economics?"}
{"link": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/43jzZOXTfjoQqkbupFrE73", "title": "BEC014 \u2014 Bitcoin Spectrum with Ben Prentice", "text": "Ben Prentice: Well I encourage everyone to really dive into the Austrian economics here because, as Collin was asking me, like How did I get into the economics side of it? Well, I got into it because I was trying to argue with people and I realized that I didn\u2019t have the knowledge. I didn\u2019t understand inflationary versus deflationary. And that\u2019s really a small piece of this, once you start getting deep into this! I think Hazlitt and Bastiat \u2014 Henry Hazlitt\u2019s the one who wrote Economics In One Lesson \u2014 incredible read, talks about a fallacy, right? So I was talking about logical fallacies before. He talks about the fallacy of the broken window. [15:32] So really simply, if you\u2019re not familiar with it, it\u2019s the idea that somebody has a shop. And the window gets broken in the shop, and that this creates economic activity and it\u2019s good for the economy, because the guy comes and sweeps up the street and he gets paid, and the glazier \u2014 the guy who makes glass \u2014 has to create a glass window, and the people who supply him with glass stock, and the people who supply him with tools to do all that, all get economic transactions out of this! So you\u2019ve created economy activity! But the fallacy is that: well, yeah, but the shop owner has to take money that he could have spent elsewhere. He could have spent it on a new pair of shoes, and \u2014 you never see those things, right? So this is the effects of that shop owner not being able to spend money on his new pair of shoes or his new suit or something \u2014 [they] are never seen, and they\u2019re obscured, and they\u2019re ignored. This happens everywhere in the economy, and if you have the government saying, Oh, well we\u2019re gonna build this thing! And, Yes, that creates economic activity, but this is like a zero-sum game, essentially. That, if you create money to pay for something, then you have diluted the supply of all the money, and you\u2019ve taken away purchasing power from everybody, and the investments that never happened, or the things that we couldn\u2019t buy because our money was worth a little bit less, are never seen. So this is a really crucial thing to understand, I think! I can keep going here, economics is so deep into this, right? Because money itself and commerce are so tied into economics, and we\u2019re talking about a digital money that is brand new, so you have to understand money! I don\u2019t think anybody really understands money!"}

That\u2019s actually a really great point if I could stop you for a second! I know for me personally, and I went to public school \u2014 I know Ben\u2019s situation is a little bit different, but, growing up I took several economics courses, probably in high school and then maybe in my undergrad also, and I had never been exposed \u2014 you know, I had heard the name F. A. Hayek, but probably in name only in mentions like in passing them off, in the same way that you would read a psychology textbook and read about Freud and be like, That guy with those crazy theories that we don\u2019t really believe anymore. That\u2019s the way that Austrian economics is presented to the modern scholar. And I\u2019m sorry (I keep saying sorry. I\u2019m not sorry) we\u2019ll bring it back to the critical thinking piece from earlier\u2014you have to examine these things for yourself! And decide whether or not they\u2019re worthy of value. And if you haven\u2019t been exposed to Austrian economics then you are not in a position to decide whether or not that\u2019s a valid argument to be made, whether or not that\u2019s a valid theory! So if you\u2019re listening to this and you think, Oh, Austrian economics is bunk! It\u2019s been bunk for years and years and years ever since modern money theory! Ever since Keynesian economics! You need to revisit that. You need to go and learn a lot more about money! Where is it? Where does it come from?"}

That you\u2019re required to fall into this network of fallacies in order to understand Keynesianism. So essentially, what I\u2019m trying to say really, really convolutedly, is that: Austrian economics breaks the fallacies that are the arguments that Keynesianism makes. And Keynesianism is the main school of thought in economics! Essentially, that governments should interfere in markets. And really, Austrian economics is really just exposing the fallacies therein! And that\u2019s why we don\u2019t even really spend time [on it]\u2014 because Keynesianism is just a bunch of equations and trying to manipulate the markets to your whim. And the thing you realize about markets and supply and demand is that the more you manipulate them the more they push back! But I really want to get into this forgotten history of money. If you don\u2019t understand the history of money, or what money is, or what problem it solves, how could you understand whether or not Bitcoin is money, or is good money, or is bad money? It\u2019s really not possible, and it\u2019s really enlightening, and that goes into \u2014 if you guys haven\u2019t read The Bitcoin Standard \u2014 incredible book that talks about the history of money and how so many great societies fell because of poor money. And a lot of it had to do with inflation. And inflation comes in many forms, but many years ago when there were gold coins or other metals used, they used debasement to inflate the currency. Which meant that they would take all the coins back, or they would collect some of them, and they would return coins out into circulation that had less of that metal in them. That was very laborious to do, it took a lot of work, you had to create all these new coins \u2014 it still had issues, and it was easy to verify! Like if you take this thing and melt it down and you find out there\u2019s less gold in it, then you could find out that the government was debasing your currency! And inflation happened much less than it happened now back then. For these reasons, because it was so hard to do."}

[In] a keystroke, they can create new digital entries at the Federal Reserve, and create new money! And that\u2019s what they did in 2008 when they created many trillions of dollars. Since then, another $10 trillion has been added to the money supply \u2014 it\u2019s insane! And this is all because it\u2019s now easier to inflate, and it\u2019s impossible to verify whether or not they\u2019re inflating or not! They can just print and print and print!

It is what has financed the world wars that we saw in the previous century. And it was unprecedented prior to that, when, in Democracy: The God That Failed, Hans Herman Hoppe, talks about how, back when private property was the norm\u2014when that was just the expectation across the board \u2014 and kings had to represent their own private best interests by engaging in armed conflict, they couldn\u2019t afford to indebt themselves indefinitely in order to fight these extremely large, expense, bloody battles, because it was impossible!

Anytime you\u2019re going through this Bitcoin spectrum here, or if you\u2019re just reading posts on Twitter and you\u2019re just trying to learn more about Bitcoin, anytime you come across any concept that you don\u2019t understand, or even if you\u2019re not 100% clear of what that is, you should take that as a learning opportunity. And you should go and you should educate yourself on that matter. Most of the time it\u2019s just a Google search away. Like if you don\u2019t know what Supply and Demand actually means, if you\u2019ve heard that in school and you don\u2019t remember what it mean, type it into Google, go to Investopedia or whatever, and just look it up! And now you\u2019re clear, because I think I see a lot of people do this, where they\u2019re participating in an argument and they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s even being discussed. But they\u2019re still arguing, even though they don\u2019t understand the concepts that are being discussed? And that really makes you look like a fool. So don\u2019t be a fool. Make sure that you understand these concepts, and if you don\u2019t understand something, jump into it. But, anyway, it\u2019s not just the economics piece. Economics sort of has an overlap with politics. It\u2019s not enough to know about just sound money, and about supply and demand, and about scarcity. You\u2019ve also got markets. You have to understand the way markets work, regulation, monetary policy, global banking, national security. Ben you want to touch on any of those?"}

I think this one, it\u2019s tough to talk about on its own, because I plan to show how these things overlap. But democracies and communities are on the politics spectrum. Democracy has been kind of \u2014 started to be infected through socialism. And a lot of people today throw that word around without really understanding what it means. Socialism is, by a simple definition, government owning the means of production. But I came across a Tweet recently that said, Japan\u2019s central bank has become a top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies there. So what do I mean by that? I mean that literally the central bank has bought stocks from all of these companies. A top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies in Japan! And it\u2019s a similar story here! I don\u2019t know the numbers on here, but the government, in open market operations, is buying stocks to support asset prices. This is what happened in 2008. They\u2019re also, through their policy, through low interest rates, they\u2019re throwing money on assets, but \u2014 we\u2019ll get into that in a second I think, but \u2014"}

And another really similar thing is going on in Switzerland. The Swiss national bank owns\u2014something like 10% of their balance sheet is international equity, and I believe half of that is actually US equity. Imagine the moral hazard of being able to print money at will, and then use that money to buy money share off of the global equities market. There\u2019s a huge incentive for malice there."}

And really in this current landscape \u2014 and after learning about a lot of these concepts \u2014 essentially, the government is stealing our wealth through inflation, they\u2019re manipulating markets, and they\u2019re really messing with all economics!

And we\u2019re not just making this stuff up. You know, there\u2019s already historical precedent for this. Just 2008 is actually a great example. You see the real estate bubble, and most people don\u2019t understand why it happened. They think that it was because the average investor thought that they could get rich quick, and that they were going out and taking out too many mortgages, and yeah, that\u2019s part of the problem, but the real problem was that credit was so easy to get, and there was so much incentive\u2014because of all the mortage-backed securities, no risk, and money that was being funneled into Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac \u2014 and this was all through the government, right? And this disrupts the normal actions of the free market. Normally, you have the benefits, and then you have the fall backs. You get to reap the rewards, but you also have to deal with the risks, deal with the fallout afterwards. And there was so much going on there, there was so much inter-breeding of government and free market there that it was what led to the bubble and caused the ultimate fallout."}

And that\u2019s exactly what I was just talking about with the risks. So the banks don\u2019t take on any risk! Because if they fail, the lender of last resort steps in. And that\u2019s what happened. There was this implicit guarantee that the government will bail out the banks, and it did happen in 2008, and millions and millions of Americans lost unknowable wealth through the real estate bubble bursting. And this brings me to another point, is that in understanding money I\u2019ve realized that, you know \u2014 what do the wealthy hold? Do they hold a savings account with a whole $10 billion? No! Absolutely not! They hold assets, which are like stocks and real estate. And we\u2019re talking about government policies that literally support the prices of these things: low interest rates and open market operations keep piling money on the stock market and real estate. And on top of this \u2014 so, money devalues over time. [33:21] So people don\u2019t hold their wealth in money! Everybody knows that just keeping a savings account means that you\u2019re losing 2%-3% per year, compounded every year. So you\u2019re losing half your wealth every 15\u201320 years! It just disappears, in money! So people hold their wealth in assets. And the assets inflate, right? So they\u2019re getting return in that. And the poor people cannot hold assets. I mean, think of somebody working at McDonald\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 they can\u2019t hold stocks or real estate as their wealth, so they lose more to inflation than rich people. Rich people don\u2019t really lose anything to inflation, because they hold such a small amount of cash, they hold equities, and they hold real estate, and they hold positions in businesses. I have another chart on this that I just Tweeted. It\u2019s just mind-blowing that, even the middle class have access to certain assets. But the richer you are, the more access you have to assets that go up even farther over time! That\u2019s the slavery that\u2019s happening right now! That\u2019s why everyone\u2019s pissed off! That\u2019s why everyone is begging for social policies. This gets into this concept that @paranoidbull, if you guys don\u2019t follow Paranoid Bull, I mean he\u2019s a grim follow, but very interesting guy! He talks about socialism for the rich.

Or even to write a new transaction, or to double-spend. And this gets me into why Bitcoin is better than all the other cryptocurrencies \u2014 probably combined! Because it has ten times the users and ten times the hashrate of all these things combined! You could turn off 10% of the supply of Bitcoin miners and point them at Bitcoin Cash, for example, and 51% attack it with ease! And one of these large Bitcoin mining pools could probably do that with ease, right now, and then go back to mining Bitcoin afterward! They could crash Bitcoin Cash if they really wanted to! That\u2019s not possible with Bitcoin. So you see a lot of Bitcoin maximalists very ardent that Bitcoin is way, way better. You have to understand all of these things together, and then you have to start to understand the economics and networks. So Metcalfe\u2019s law, network effects, and how much larger the network of Bitcoin is, and how much more people know about Bitcoin and use Bitcoin. And where it\u2019s accepted, if you want to go that route. How much further ahead it is. I also wanted to get into how cryptography and distributed systems \u2014 specifically BitTorrent. If you guys don\u2019t remember, in the 90\u2019s there was Napster. Napster was where you could download songs for free. I remember showing this to my friends and they were like, Wow! You can download any song for free? And I was like, Yep! Right there! Check it out! And it was shut down. And then there was Morpheus and Limewire and all these other services came out after it and those were all shut down too. [39:17] And then somebody came along and made this thing called BitTorrent. And the governments were like, Huh! There\u2019s really no way to shut this down! It\u2019s a peer to peer network! You\u2019d have to go down to every single person\u2019s house and shut them all off. And BitTorrent opened the door to a system that could never be turned off. And that kind of goes into the decentralization of Bitcoin, why decentralization is so important, and why Bitcoiners are small blockers, versus the big block Bitcoin Cash people. The decentralization of the network is paramount! It\u2019s the most important thing! If you do not have this decentralization, it will get shut down! We know, because all of the other sovereign monies that were tried outside of the government all got shut down. From Liberty Dollar to real meatspace stuff to BCash and BitGold. There was a number of digital currencies started and eventually the government just shows up and knocks on the door and says, Yeah you guys gotta turn this stuff of. The decentralization of Bitcoin, plus solving the double-spend problem, is what makes it resilient to this. Its antifragility. And if you don\u2019t understand that concept you\u2019re not gonna understand why Bitcoiners think that it\u2019s better than all the other cryptocurrencies. And while we\u2019re on distributed systems and open source software, you get into network architecture. The network architecture of the Internet is built with Internet Protocol first, then its TCP/IP, and then later they built all these other layers on top of that: HTTPS \u2014 and those things don\u2019t change, right? So IP, TCP \u2014 we\u2019re not changing those protocols. Another good example is e-mail, the POP and IMAP, haven\u2019t changed in 20 or 30 years! You know, there\u2019s no read receipts, there\u2019s no undo button, and there\u2019s a number of features that we could add if we could change the protocols underlying these things, but they don\u2019t change. And there\u2019s a reason these things don\u2019t change \u2014 it\u2019s because these things are being built in layers. And understanding why the Lightning Network developed the way it did \u2014 you have to crucially understand these concepts first, right? I think that\u2019s mainly covering most of these giant things. If you want we can go into how some of these overlap, but we already kind of started that. What do you think, Collin?"}

Well, I\u2019ll touch on some of the things that you just mentioned. You were talking about how, a lot of people, they see the Bitcoiners ardently proclaiming that Bitcoin is so objectively more secure than any other project. And the layman hears that and says, This guy! This guy is trying to pump his bags! He cares more about his \u2014 he\u2019s selfish! He wants Bitcoin to win and he wants everyone else to lose! But the real objective truth is that we\u2019re talking orders of magnitude, the levels of security that Bitcoin has relative to everything else, and I would even argue \u2014 first of all, I think that proof of stake is stupid, but that\u2019s a rabbit hole we\u2019re not gonna go down right now. I would argue that minority proof of work chains, meaning any proof of work coin that isn\u2019t Bitcoin, is at a severe severe severe security disadvantage, for the reason that Ben talked about earlier, is that you can just take a small fraction of the hashpower from the Bitcoin network \u2014 leaving Bitcoin\u2019s security completely unchanged \u2014 and you can attack a minority chain with that. And you can affect a lot of people that are using that chain that way. And the Bitcoin\u2019s main security isn\u2019t even touched! So when people say, when you\u2019re on Twitter, you see people saying, Oh! Bitcoin is the only secure cryptocurrency. There\u2019s a reason that they\u2019re saying it! They\u2019re not talking under their butt, they\u2019re not trying to pump their bags \u2014"}

And many economists\u2014usually proponents of the free markets \u2014 stop short at money. They insist that money should be regulated by the government and issued by the government. But it didn\u2019t used to be. It used to be gold! We essentially, by confiscating gold and making it illegal to hold gold, we took the free market out of money completely! And we\u2019ve replaced it with these pieces of paper that allow us to create money with a keystroke. And [they\u2019ve] powerfully and subtly acquired the stored time of people \u2014 Misir Mahmudov talks about money as a stored time. You go work a bunch, and then later in life you redeem those tokens that you\u2019ve received. But if those tokens can be diluted, they\u2019re diluting your time! I had a friend who came to me and he was saying, If somebody wastes some of your time, they are murdering part of your life. They\u2019re actually taking part of your life away. Right? So if you go watch a 30-second ad, for example \u2014 and he started doing all the math and the average lifespan is 80 years or something, and he said \u2014 A minute of your time is a micromurder! Because he calculated how much time you have in your life, and if you waste one day of it, then it\u2019s one millionth of that or something. And I turned to him and I said, Well yeah, but you store your time in money! So if the government is diluting the supply of money, that means they\u2019re murdering you at 3% per year! And he goes, Oh. That\u2019s a really good point. [50:24] Legal tender laws are tied into this confiscation of gold thing, right? Where they essentially \u2014 the US government suspended redeemability of gold a number of times, until 1971, when Richard F\u2019ing Nixon suspended the redeemability of gold forever."}
{"link": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/43jzZOXTfjoQqkbupFrE73", "title": "BEC014 \u2014 Bitcoin Spectrum with Ben Prentice", "text": "Collin: Right. And I would add, the reason this happens is because of something called Gresham\u2019s Law, which is where a good money will be hoarded, and bad money will be circulated. Meaning that, people \u2014 like, the free market knows what\u2019s good money and what\u2019s bad money. And that\u2019s why, in these systems where we had gold notes and gold in the banks, you\u2019d see people spending the bad money, and hoarding \u2014 you know, anytime they could get a hold of gold or silver coins, they\u2019d take it home and they\u2019d put it in the dresser drawer, or they\u2019d store it in a bank deposit box. Because even if they don\u2019t consciously realize it, they know that that holds its value, and that the paper gets diluted over time and it loses its value, and that\u2019s where these legal tender laws come from: is the government has to force people to use the paper that their brains tell them, No! That\u2019s not as good as the gold! Because it\u2019s not as hard of a value. The legal tender laws force you! You have to pay your taxes, you have to accept this if you own a store. You have to use this if you want somebody to buy your house. You\u2019re not allowed to just say, No, you have to pay me in gold bars, because legal tender laws force you to circumvent the free market demand."}

Again you have to understand why we use paper money in the first place. We started to use paper certificates of gold. They were stand-ins, where the gold was kept in vaults. And you get to the centralization of gold in vaults problem: the person that holds all the gold, really, is the person who holds all the money, not the people that hold the paper. Because you have to actually get the gold. If the paper is inflated too much, well then you\u2019re gonna want the gold back, but it\u2019s all held in banks and the government\u2019s confiscated it all. Oh and you talked about Gresham\u2019s Law, but I never talk about Gresham\u2019s Law without talking about Thiers\u2019 Law, which is like the reciprocal of it! So you talked about: bad money drives out good money, meaning that people hoard the good money, and the spend the bad money, so all the bad money is being spent in the economy. But Thiers\u2019 Law is when good money drives out bad money. Meaning that, once the purchasing power of the bad money gets so bad, people no longer want it at all.

And gold! It has verifiable purity. It goes back to the verifiability of cryptography and math. So when you tested gold, to make sure that it was good gold, you had to melt it down or weigh it, you had to do all this stuff in order to make sure it\u2019s the right density, that it is actually gold. Well, Bitcoin is not only trivial to verify \u2014 like, how much digital gold somebody just gave you? You can actually melt down the entire supply of Bitcoin every ten minutes using your full node. So you can trivially verify all of the Bitcoin, you can melt down the entire supply all at once. It also cannot be inflated. The reason it cannot be inflated is the immutability of this very large decentralized network that is based on mathematical security that there will never be more than 21 million. Bitcoin will never be suppressed because of the BitTorrent thing. They made Napster, then Limewire, then Morpheus, but they couldn\u2019t shut down BitTorrent! And they still haven\u2019t, much to their dismay. Bitcoin cannot be turned off! And it can\u2019t really be suppressed. In Venezuela, they\u2019re trying to suppress Bitcoin, they\u2019re knocking on miners\u2019 doors and confiscating mining equipment in Venezuela. But you can send a packet anywhere in the world very easily by connecting to any network. And in the future mesh networking will become even more prolific.

We started off not having any money and just bartering and eventually people realized that everybody liked wheat, for example, and everybody used wheat as money because it was widely used. And then they went on and used shells and glass beads and stones \u2014 and all of these things got inflated. So inflation was really the problem with most monies. [57:55] [For] some of them durability was a problem. And eventually gold took over all money because it was the best money, not because a government enforced gold. It means that individually, separately, just like us Bitcoiners individually coming to the same conclusions, the markets across the world, individually, separate from each other, zeroed in on gold. And the reason that they zeroed in on gold was mostly because it was very difficult to inflate. It grew this very large stockpile, and then the flow of new gold coming in was so insignificant that you weren\u2019t diluting your supply of your stored time energy with your gold. But gold had a really big issue with it. It wasn\u2019t portable, and it wasn\u2019t divisible to the needs of the modern world. If I wanted to transact with somebody in Sweden or in Japan, well I have to mail them a bunch of gold, and that\u2019s why they started using money certificates that were stand-ins for the gold that could be easily moved around and they made it divisible and all this stuff. But it led to the centralization of gold in vaults and it gave governments all this undue power to manipulate the supply of money because we eventually got off of certificates and we got onto pure fiat money and all these other problems. But Bitcoin is a 10x improvement on gold, because A) it solves the portability issue. Obviously, it\u2019s digital information content type, we can move it around in ways that we can\u2019t even imagine yet! You know, the Lightning Network is talking about streaming money \u2014 these concepts that are still so foreign to us. B) It\u2019s censorship-resistant, meaning that nobody can stop you from using it. C) The innovation on Bitcoin. You don\u2019t need to go to a central bank and get permission from them. You don\u2019t need to go to the government to get permission from them. You don\u2019t need to go to Paypal and get permission to innovate and create new tools like streaming money or whatever. D) Access to it is access to anybody that has access to the Internet. A $20 cell phone as Andreas says, in Sudan, using a solar charger, can access this stuff. E) The unforgeable costliness, how much computing energy has gone into creating this blockchain that is now immutable because it has tens of thousands of nodes\u2014I think it\u2019s close to a hundred thousands nodes now \u2014 around the world. F) The verifiability, etc. All of this stuff is the improvement that Bitcoin is on gold and why we think Bitcoin will just start seeping into every place where it is better money than these other things. And I think the biggest challenge to Bitcoin right now is its biggest boon, which is the volatility. If you talk to anybody intelligent about this who isn\u2019t into Bitcoin, they\u2019ll say, Yeah but if I put my money in Bitcoin it can go up and down?"}

But it essentially means how salable over time this thing is, and how much is stored in it. We talk about the market cap of the stock market and how much US dollars is it. Trillions of US dollars and we use dollars as the unit of account. The liquidity of the Bitcoin network is like $90 billion today. And that, in relation to all of these other gigantic currencies in the hundreds of trillions each, it\u2019s just a drop in the bucket! It can get swayed around. But understanding why the price keeps rising really is tied into this halving schedule. People adopting it and it acquiring a monetary premium. You know monetary premium, Collin?"}

So, at the bottom of this chart, we have game theory. And you see a lot of people, particularly the people that are newer to crypto, or have really just got Bitcoin and they want to get more people into it, and they ask the question, What\u2019s a good, simple, 5 minute explanation that I can use to make somebody understand Bitcoin and blockchain completely? And I think that we\u2019ve kind of demonstrated here by going through the spectrum, that there really isn\u2019t an answer to that question! People say, Well, you\u2019ll never be able to get my grandma to understand this thing!

Essentially, it\u2019s funny because, you know, I spent so much time trying to tell people about Bitcoin, and some of them listened, and some of them don\u2019t, and some of them even have acquired some. But I think that everybody in the world is incentivized. They\u2019re game theoretically incentivized to acquire some of this, actually! And they\u2019re gonna buy some for the same reason I did. I told you this story, I knew about this a long time ago, but I only bought some when the price went up a lot! And I think the price is gonna continue going up! And understanding that is understanding all of the other stuff that I just talked about. But when the price goes up on something, well people get interested in it! And they might get a little bit! And then when people get some the hype surrounds it, the price goes up more. And people start to learn more about it. Which is what happened to me. I bought some, and then I started to learn a lot more about it. That\u2019s really the answer, is that I think that this is a better money! I think it\u2019s going to lead to prosperity for the people and not socialism for the rich. It\u2019s gonna lift everybody up, even the politicians, they\u2019re gonna be incentivized to buy some. Even rich people, they\u2019re gonna be incentivized to buy some. Maybe even central banks. I\u2019m not sure about that one. But I think we\u2019re all incentivized to want to hold the best money, and it is the best money, and that will help civilization scale in ways that we can\u2019t even imagine!"}

So I thought it would be good to explore this topic together on: Is it bullish or bearish for Bitcoin? What are some of the things that we need to think about with stablecoins? So perhaps, to start off, just for listeners who might not be so familiar \u2014 what is a stablecoin and what are some of the main ones?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Yeah, this is actually a topic of debate: What the definition of a stablecoin is. What should we even call them \u2014 it\u2019s not even necessarily settled, that stablecoins is the thing to call them. But basically, the way I define them, is: a tokenized representation of a fiat currency that circulates on-chain. So that\u2019s really the simplest definition. And then, there\u2019s a number of different ways they try and target the return profile of that sovereign currency. The main way is just by being redeemable for units of that currency that are immobilized in a commercial bank. But there\u2019s other ways. Some of them are, in my opinion, pretty crazy and not likely to work. The algorithmic uncollateralized model\u2014I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever really seen that work. I think it\u2019s unlikely to work. And then there\u2019s the maybe more interesting approach, which is to take some crypto-collateral, which is volatile, and use that basket to create something which is more stable in terms of its risk profile with algorithmic risk management systems. And you could in theory do that against Bitcoin. And then there\u2019s a final way to create stablecoins, which is to basically create a pair of Bitcoin derivative and a spot position, so you can have a short and a long position paired up together, and that\u2019s one way to create a stable which we\u2019re seeing out there. So there\u2019s a bunch of different ways to do it, but the key idea is, Hey, public blockchains are great for moving value around\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could move stable value around? I know a lot of Bitcoiners don\u2019t like this concept, but the truth is, it really is catching on, and it\u2019s one of the early industry killer apps."}

And it\u2019s probably also good to contextualize here: what\u2019s the kind of split in terms of the stablecoins? Are they, I presume, they are mostly \u2014 Tether is probably the elephant in the room here, right? Most of the stablecoin volume would be of that type, right? Like the type where it\u2019s US dollars in a bank account somewhere, and these stablecoins represent some claim, or their value is meant to reflect those, right?"}

Now with Tether and actually other ones, there\u2019s complications\u2014 not everyone can necessarily redeem it. You might have to be a special entity or you might have to have a certain threshhold in order to do that redemption. But it\u2019s still the possibility of redemption which is the thing that keeps it trading around one dollar."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Well it\u2019s hard to directly apprehend that, right? Because, if you\u2019re using a stablecoin, you\u2019re outside of the traditional financial system, and you might be outside of that system for good reason. You might be an import/export business operating on a cross-border between Russia and China, and you have very good reasons to not make your transactions known to the authorities. And so, you are strongly incentivized to not broadcast your usage of stablecoins. I think unambiguously the biggest consumers of stablecoins are just entities that are active in the cryptocurrency markets, so: traders, hedge funds, proprietary funds, arbitrage funds, market makers, these are the entities that need crypto-denominated liquidity, and they need an arbitrage or a market maker firm, you know, they\u2019ll be active on dozens of exchanges at the same time. They need to manage their collateral. They might have a preference to hold it in fiat terms. They may not want to be directionally long Bitcoin at all times. So they might prefer dollar-based collateral. And so, stablecoins would be a good choice for them. They get the settlement assurances of using a public blockchain, but they also get to manage their risk in terms of volatility. So that\u2019s a huge, huge consumer of stablecoins. Increasingly we just also have regular old businesses denominating their balance sheet in stablecoins, and more and more, the firms that we invest on, as a venture fund, will ask us for a stablecoin-denominated investment. They don\u2019t want to get bank wires. They want USDC. And we\u2019ve begun to do that as well. So what we\u2019re seeing is the whole supply chain of some of these early stage businesses is flipping from commercial bank liquidity to on-chain liquidity, and it flips because they\u2019ll receive investment in stablecoin terms, and then their expenditures will be denominated in stablecoin terms. This crypto industry is a globalized system where there\u2019s less geographic hubs of consequence, and the talent is much more globally dispersed. For payroll for instance, for a global audience, it actually is generally more convenient to use something like USDT or USDC to pay people if you have employees in fifteen different countries. That\u2019s probably cheaper and easier than the corresponding banking system. And so you see the whole supply chain of certain businesses flipping from being commercial bank based to being crypto-liquidity based. So that\u2019s another really interesting new genre of stablecoin consumer that we\u2019ve seen emerge this year. But yeah it was an easier question to answer two years ago when it really was just traders that was using stablecoins. Today it\u2019s just all kinds of businesses, I mean we have FinTech providers, we\u2019ve invested in some of these businesses that are giving stablecoin access\u2014or intermediated access to stablecoins \u2014 in countries where there\u2019s currency crises, as kind of a FinTech product. So yeah the phenomenon is really taking off and there\u2019s a really heterogeneous set of entities that actually use these things."}

And I can guess there\u2019s probably some good answers for that. What would you speculate, or if you know? Why do you think that is?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Yeah. I mean it\u2019s a very fair question! I would say probably the main reason is the mental transaction cost of introducing a new numeraire. Now Bitcoin, probably about 50\u2013100 million worldwide are familiar with Bitcoin, but probably half of the world\u2019s population is familiar with the dollar. The dollar is the de facto global reserve currency. And then, even in countries where dollars aren\u2019t the local currency, people still kind of know how to price things in dollars. They have an appreciation for the dollar. And this isn\u2019t like my love-letter to the Federal Reserve or anything. It\u2019s just a statement of reality. As a unit of account, the dollar is very popular. So I think people are just more comfortable in receiving payments in dollar terms, at this state of Bitcoin adoption. Of course, I expect that to change in the long term as Bitcoin becomes much more ubiquitous, but for now, stablecoins are kind of an intermediate or bridge asset where people are realizing, Hey, public blockchain infrastructure is actually a more convenient way to do business, especially on a cross-border basis. But they haven\u2019t fully become used to Bitcoin as their unit of account, so for this transitional period, it\u2019s a really suitable asset, basically."}

And for payments while payments are in flight, you don\u2019t necessarily want the exchange rate to be changing dramatically. So yeah, there\u2019s good reasons to use the dollar. My view is that these things are strongly mutualistic, and so I don\u2019t see cryptodollars as stablecoins as being a threat to Bitcoin in any way. I think they\u2019re kind of supportive of each other."}

And my understanding is also that there are traders who are using it to get around the exchanges quickly in terms of doing the fiat leg a bit faster for them to arbitrage and things like that. But there\u2019s also this story of people in other countries around the world who want to get around capital or currency controls, in some cases, get their money out of the country. Have you seen that in your travels and your discussions in the industry?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Yeah. I mean, this is an established concept today. So, Chainalysis, you know, a lot of people consider them to be villainous. They do put out some good research, so I would encourage your listeners to look at their report where they find \u2014 and I have no reason to doubt their methodology, I think it\u2019s probably quite sound \u2014 they find about $50 billion worth of capital outflows from China taking place in Tether terms. So these are real numbers, and so that\u2019s a story about evading capital controls. And now, the Chinese government may not like that, but we\u2019re talking about a new epoch in payments technology. We\u2019re talking about digital bearer assets. This is their manifestation. This is what people choose to use them for, and that\u2019s just a reality. And if you look at Tether transactions, you can see they happen mostly during Asian trading hours. So they\u2019re very, very popular as an alternative payment system, and a way to offshore wealth from countries that are engaging in monetary repression. A more direct answer, where I have firsthand experience, would be in places like Latin America, Argentina in particular, Venezuela and Colombia. In those three countries the currencies are very weak. There\u2019s a big Venezuelan diaspora which is internally displaced within Latin America. There\u2019s a number of startups that are using \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of Bitcoin there \u2014 but there\u2019s also a number of startups that are using stablecoins to give people a dollar savings device. Now there are dollars that are present in those countries, physical dollars. But they\u2019re kind of hard to get your hands on, and they aren\u2019t necessarily in the right denominations, there\u2019s a lack of small denomination bills. And of course dollars are easy to seize. And there is Bitcoinization occuring, of course, but there\u2019s also a movement where people are engaging in this cryptodollarization, where they are getting exposure to dollar-based products through public blockchains. Now, Bitcoin is critical in this whole process, but what people are really after, for the most part, is dollars. And they\u2019re seeking dollars as a way to connect remittances, move money around, without asking for permission \u2014 but also as a wealth preservation device. We\u2019ve invested in startups active down there doing exactly that. I think FinTech experiences that are built on top of cryptodollar rails are gonna be a much more pervasive concept in the next five years."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Stephan Livera: Yeah so it\u2019s a range of different people who are using these stablecoins, whether it\u2019s traders or companies who want to get funded in stablecoins, or people in the developing world who want to get around capital and currency controls. So my understanding as well is with some of the South American stories, is that there are all kinds of different ways that people are using different payments, whether that\u2019s things like Zelle or some of these other normal fiat banking dollars, but this is just now presenting another option for people who want to try to \u2014 maybe they\u2019re not necessarily looking for the maximum level of censorship-resistance, but they\u2019re just using some of these different bank accounts and so on, and this is just another way of helping \u2014 maybe we can think of it like greasing the wheels, right?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter [17:04]: Yeah. Zelle is very popular in Venezuela, you\u2019re absolutely right. But Zelle is also created by a consortium of US banks, and those banks aren\u2019t really too keen on having end-users in Venezuela, because there are no formal US sanctions on the country of Venezuela, but there are sanctions on members of the Maduro regime, and it\u2019s kind of like taint, if you think about taint in the network graph. It\u2019s basically the same concept. If you go to the coffee shop which is run by the nephew of the minister of transport, and he happens to be sanctioned, there\u2019s a risk that you inherit that as well. So you become tainted by association, and then you get de-platformed from all of your Western FinTech and payment apps. And so that happens a lot. Wells Fargo has been on a real campaign to basically deplatform the Venezuelan users of Zelle. So Zelle is good UX and people really seem to like it, but it\u2019s very much exposed to what the banks want to do. Now stablecoins have bank relationships, for most of them. The fiat-convertible ones, you know, those ultimately are claims on dollars in a bank. You don\u2019t need to interface with a bank to use a stablecoin, you just need to acquire it on the open markets and receive it on an on-chain transactions. 99% of stablecoin transactions don\u2019t involve facing off against the bank directly, or against the issuer. So they are kind of less encumbered than commercial bank relationships, and I know people talk about the freezing possibility. Tether has frozen a couple hundred addresses in its history. USDC has frozen a small handful. So that does happen, but it\u2019s nowhere near as pervasive as deplatforming from the financial system. So it\u2019s certainly not as censor-resistant as Bitcoin. Now there are stablecoins you can look to which probably have slightly better censor-resistant qualities like DAI, which is built against crypto-collateral and\u2014in theory you could do the same with Bitcoin! You could probably figure out how to build a stablecoin using DLCs or other smart contracting technologies to build a dollar-denominated asset which is backed by a basket of Bitcoins, which would also be pretty trustless. And I expect someone to make that in the next year or so. So even within the stablecoin space there\u2019s a bit of nuance in terms of the settlement assurances you have."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Stephan Livera [20:01]: Yeah that\u2019s an interesting idea there as well. I recall from one of my relatively recent episodes with Nadav Kohen from Suredbits, he spoke about exactly that kind of idea: using discrete log contracts to do a similar kind of thing with Bitcoin. One other point I wanted to touch on was around the compliance aspects. So you were mentioning there: usually AML laws and sanctions laws that we\u2019re talking about here\u2014and to be clear, one of them is Politically Exposed Persons \u2014 so that\u2019s where there\u2019s whole idea of, if you\u2019re a politician or you\u2019re a senior level bureaucrat or something and then your family might be also implicated in that. But with stablecoins it\u2019s more like, the compliance seems to be occuring at the entry and the exit points, and once you\u2019re kind of inside that system it seems to be more of a freewheeling system, wouldn\u2019t you say?"}

Anybody that looks into stablecoins long enough eventually has this realization, and it\u2019s like, Oh wow! This is actually a little bit different from the way that the financial system works. Or even something like PayPal, right? Pretty much every single transaction on PayPal contains metadata and identity information. And PayPal has the right\u2014and they take advantage of this \u2014 to freeze any of those transactions. In fact, I sent a joke PayPal transaction to my friend Neeraj of CoinCenter, and I think I made the memo field something like \u201cNorth Korea\u201d and like \u201cPersian Rugs\u201d just to see what would happen, and they froze it!"}

Now in stablecoins, as you say, those egress and ingress transactions where you are creating or redeeming stablecoins, there\u2019s KYC involved there. But on the internals of the transaction graph, those transactions that are actually ocurring on either Bitcoin, on the OMNI protocol, or on Etheream as ERC-20 transactions, or even on TRON which is popular for stablecoins for some reason, those P2P transfers are really not meaningfully being surveilled. There\u2019s not a lot of identity information that can be associated with them, because it\u2019s pseudonymous. So on the internals of the transaction graph you have a situation where it much more resembles actual digital cash, in the same way that physical cash transfers do not carry any surveillance. And basically, P2P stablecoin transfers, on-chain, much more closely resemble physical cash transactions, and they have less in common with these transactions on these digital payments networks that we\u2019re used to. And it\u2019s kind of a startling realization. JP Koning, who is not a Bitcoiner but he writes fairly intelligently about payment networks, has called this the permissioned pseudonymity model, and it\u2019s honestly a really big outstanding question whether the state or regulators are gonna take a look at this and realize what\u2019s going on and say, Okay, we\u2019ve got to put an end to this!"}

And so, it allows all sorts of hack workarounds in some ways. Whereas, if they do clamp down harder, then obviously it becomes more difficult for people to get money in and out of exchanges and move it around, and do all of these other on the side things, and other services that are operating on a more stablecoin basis, like stablecoin lending and so on."}

Fundamentally, we\u2019re talking about blockchains which are pseudonymous. I\u2019m not sure how you would try and inject identity information. Currently stablecoin issuers operate on a blacklist model, where they will blacklist certain addresses and freeze those funds if, for instance, they get a subpoena from law enforcement that says, Hey, this is an entity that hacked an exchange \u2014 could you immobilize these funds? But you can\u2019t transition that really easily to a whitelist model where default node transactions are permitted unless you make yourself known to the issuer. The whitelist model would just make these networks not work. So I don\u2019t know functionally what it would even look like for regulators to even grapple with this."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Currently, collectively, all of the stablecoins will do about $5 billion worth of settled value every single day. So, pretty meaningful \u2014 it\u2019s up from effectively zero a couple years ago. Now Bitcoin is doing also about $5 billion of settled value per day. Now the thing to note though is that Bitcoin\u2019s aggregate market cap is north of $300 billion. The aggregate market cap of stablecoins is closer to $25 billion, so you can see that stablecoins have a much higher velocity. They\u2019re turning over more frequently, whereas Bitcoin has a much slower velocity. So what this tells us is that they\u2019re doing roughly equal amounts in terms of settling value every day, but stablecoins are doing so with the whole supply turning over more frequently, which shows that they\u2019re being employed more as means of payment, whereas Bitcoin is this more slow-moving wealth storage mechanism."}

Do they work with it or are they in some way detracting from Bitcoin demand? Now I know you are more on the bullish side, but let\u2019s\u2019 first explore some of the bearish arguments, right? So maybe one of the bearish arguments would be, Oh, it\u2019s detracting from Bitcoin demand! Some people might just stay in stablecoins rather than using Bitcoin. What do you think?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Yeah. Honestly that\u2019s already happened to a certain degree. If you look at exchange volumes, if you look at the pairs that are traded globally, if you look at exchange reserves, you notice that a lot of these\u2014what would formerly trade against Bitcoin\u2014all these exchanges with altcoin pairs and derivatives with Bitcoin being the more popular asset, either the base pair or the quote pair. I\u2019m forgetting which one it is. Bitcoin was the de facto reserve asset of the crypto industry from the inception, right? And over the last couple of years, many exchanges becamed Tetherized, so Tether became the base pair, and all of these markets were expressed in Tether terms, and the main collateral that was held on these exchanges was Tether, effectively. So you had some purist exchanges\u2014like BitMex, they were a purist exchange. They never had any stablecoins on there. The only way to get collateral on the exchange was on Bitcoin terms. But, you know, now they\u2019ve shrunk a little, and other newer exchanges like ByBit and FTX, they all use Tether as the main form of collateral, and the main way to make a deposit, and a lot of them quote their markets in Tether. So this has actually already happened! But what\u2019s interesting is, here we are, back at all time highs for Bitcoin. So this kind of implies that, Yes, some of this reservation demand for being the reserve asset for altcoin trading and for derivatives trading, some of that reservation demand was effectively removed and was moved into Tether, basically\u2014and other stablecoins, right? But this hasn\u2019t really affected Bitcoin! Bitcoin is still fine! So it\u2019s just the nature of Bitcoin that\u2019s changing a little bit, it\u2019s more of a global macro asset. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need that reservation demand. But yes, unambiguously I think exchanges getting Tetherized did remove a certain reservation demand from Bitcoin, and probably had a bit of a price impact. It\u2019s impossible to quantify. The ultimate question is, Can stablecoins sustain this indefinitely? And I would probably argue, No, I don\u2019t think they have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, because stablecoins are ultimately someone\u2019s liability. They\u2019re a liability of an issuer, in most cases, of a commercial bank. And that\u2019s not a great property to have for a monetary good! Pure monetary goods like gold and Bitcoin are no one\u2019s liability. Their value comes not from someone else promising to back it, but the value is solely market determined, which is the case for Bitcoin. So ultimately, the true reserve asset, the true monetary base asset at the base of that pyramid \u2014 you do want it to be something that\u2019s trustless collateral, which stablecoins are not. So I don\u2019t think they can ever really fully replace Bitcoin as that key high-powered collateral."}

I think that\u2019s really nicely put, because ultimately they\u2019re not monetary competitors with Bitcoin in the longer term sense, they are just more like a helping tool or a bridging tool that people are using in the here and now. And also, to the point about volumes and sizes, obviously there\u2019s this whole canard that seems to come up from some people who are not that familiar with what Tether is and what some of these stablecoins are. The typical argument is, Oh, see! Bitcoin is being pumped by Tether! What do you think on that kind of argument?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter [33:11]: Yeah. So I\u2019ll go on the record here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever really addressed it on a podcast before. Yeah I\u2019d love to see some evidence of that. I think the onus and the burden of proof is on the people making the positive claim. All the proof I\u2019ve ever seen, all the evidence\u2014talking to traders that have created hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars worth of Tether \u2014 is that there is a counter-party there, they are using bank wires, they\u2019re using real fiat currency through the commercial banking system around, to create and redeem Tether! And I am not a Tether user, I personally have never used Tether, but I had Dan Matuszewski on my podcast a while back, and he told me that when he was at the Circle OTC desk they created billions of dollars worth of Tether, and that\u2019s with bank wires! So that\u2019s taking real dollars and wiring them to the counter-party and getting Tethers against those dollars. And then redeem them on the other side. That\u2019s all consistent with Tether being, at least in some sense, a real thing. Now obviously it\u2019s impossible to ascertain the reserve quality, and that\u2019s a huge shortcoming which I totally agree should be addressed. And I\u2019d love to see more transparency behind all of the stablecoin issuers, not just Tether. It\u2019s actually hard to get good reliable information on the quality of the reserves, for even the on-shore US based stablecoin issuers. But now this notion is taken a little bit further\u2014which is that Tether is somehow responsible for the price of Bitcoin \u2014 is just preposterous to me! There\u2019s one study from Griffin and Shams, which relied on timing analysis, and they found that, during periods when Tether was being issued, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose in those periods, which is \u2014 you know there\u2019s so many alternative explanations that aren\u2019t consistent with Tether somehow buoying the price of Bitcoin. The obvious alternative explanation is, Well, traders were engaging in dip buying, and they used Tether as a conduit to get into crypto exchanges, get into crypto liquidity. It\u2019s no coincidence that Tether issuance was happening at the same time as they were placing their buy orders, because they were using those Tethers to subsequently buy Bitcoin. So, there\u2019s very simple alternative explanations there. The other thing is, part of their paper relied on this analysis of looking on-chain and seeing when there are high periods of on-chain volumes for Tether and finding that that correlated with Bitcoin price increases. But the other thing to point out there is, price increases are synchronous and coincident with high on-chain transfers, just by their very nature, because when price is going up, there\u2019s a lot of activity. Those arbitrage funds kick in to high gear. So that\u2019s also something that can be very easily explained. Look, I\u2019m not gonna deny that Tether could be doing a much better job of their transparency, and at this point they\u2019re systemic to the whole crypto industry. So, like many others, I would love to see more transparency from them in their reserve quality. But I\u2019ve also never seen any direct evidence whatsoever, that Tether is somehow either unbacked or, more perniciously, being used to inflate the price of Bitcoin, which makes no sense. I mean, if you\u2019re Tether, and you could magically inflate the price of Bitcoin by printing unbacked Tethers without the market ascertaining that, what\u2019s to stop you printing the price of Bitcoin arbitrarily high? Why, in that case, are we only at $19,000? Why aren\u2019t we at $300,000? You know? The critics don\u2019t really have a plausible story to tell here. The other thing I\u2019ll mention is that there have been subsequent analyses that have focused on the same Griffin and Shams paper and have found no direct effect between Tether issuance and the Bitcoin price. One was by Viswanath-Natraj. The academia isn\u2019t settled on this topic, either."}

The other thing to note is that Bitcoin was roughly flat for a long 2-year period here, if you measure from late 2018 to earlier this year. Whereas Tether was increasing by a full order of magnitude. It went from a couple billion in late 2017 to $25 billion today. So for a long period where Bitcoin was trading sideways, more funds were getting onshored onto Tether, partly due to this replacement that I mentioned, where Bitcoin ceased to be the crypto reserve asset, or lost some of its qualities as the crypto reserve asset. So Tether was increasing by hundreds and hundreds of percent, but Bitcoin was flat during that time, so that\u2019s completely inconsistent with this Tether inflates Bitcoin thesis as well."}

Rather, people would instead lean on these incredibly simplistic explanations of insidious market makers somehow manipulating the whole market and manipulating price upwards. They can\u2019t find it in their souls to believe that Bitcoin is just this newly monetizing monetary commodity. That\u2019s too difficult or complex of an explanation for them."}

Perhaps at some level they\u2019ve already committed their minds in a certain direction and now to turn around and go back, maybe that\u2019s just difficult for people to do or maybe they feel that would make them look weak or whatever. One other point that you brought up there recently is systemic risk and blow-up. That could potentially be another bear case for stablecoins in terms of Bitcoin impact. If one of these big ones\u2014for example Tether, or one of the other ones \u2014 if there were to be some big systemic blow-up, could that look really bad for the ecosystem?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter [41:09]: Yes, it could. And I think the big casualty would actually be longtail altcoins, which trade exclusively against Tether. A lot of these marketplaces and exchanges don\u2019t have connectivity to a fiat system, and in fact the reason they\u2019ve been able to emerge is because stablecoins exist, right? So once stablecoins were in place, this new set of altcoin exchanges could emerge. And they have done so. They would be the big casualties if Tether blew up. And that would eviscerate the liquidity for a lot of longtail alts that are traded only against crypto-pairs. They\u2019re no fiat pairs for those altcoins. So they would be the big casualties in my opinion. Now the effect on Bitcoin is more mixed, and I think what is very possible is that there would be an inflow of funds back into Bitcoin as a kind of safety net, because if it emerged that Tether was insolvent or not fully reserved or something, what are traders gonna do with the Tethers that they hold? What is the most liquid pair that Tether is traded against? It\u2019s against Bitcoin! So I think that\u2019s where they flee! It might be more challenging for them to flee back into their sovereign currencies and they may not want to do that. So I think they flee into the alternative crypto reserve asset which is truly liability-free, and cannot be impaired by a lack of reserves, the same way Tether can be. So my guess is if anything happens to Tether, a lot of capital is gonna flow back into Bitcoin as safety net, the same way that you have a global risk-off even in regular capital markets, and capital flows into US Treasuries, which is considered the safest and most liquid asset. So I would say there is the potential for it to actually cause a huge capital inflow back into Bitcoin. And we\u2019re talking about roughly $20 billion worth of Tether, so it\u2019s a really material amount. So bad for crypto markets generally, but potentially good for Bitcoin as this liability free base asset."}

And then the stablecoin people are left holding a bag if they\u2019re using an altcoin platform to do that stablecoin with. Do you have any thoughts on that, and how the market participants are evaluating that risk?"}

I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evaluating it, Stephan, to be honest with you. The most number of Tethers that ever existed on Bitcoin was about $3 billion. Now, on TRON, there\u2019s double that today: there\u2019s $6 billion worth of Tethers that circulate on TRON, they\u2019ve got a fixed validator set and it\u2019s pretty centralized in terms of the node validation and the consensus formation, right? I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be that difficult for a highly motivated state actor to interfere with TRON if they wanted. But you have more Tethers circulating on TRON, lots more, than ever circulated on the OMNI protocol on Bitcoin. And on Ethereum, you have over $12 billion worth of Tether, and you also have billions of dollars worth of other stablecoins on Ethereum too, like USDC. There\u2019s another $3 billion of USDC on Ethereum! So I think the entities using Tether, they kind of just take it as a given that the blockchains that they circulate on are just gonna function well in perpetuity. They don\u2019t seem too concerned about it, and they switch between them all the time. What they do is they use these exchanges as these hubs to switch between Tether Bitcoin, Tether Ethereum, and Tether TRON. So they switch between them seamlessly. It seems like traders treat it as the same asset regardless of the actual blockchain infrastructure that it\u2019s circulating on. But yeah, it seems to me that people aren\u2019t really concerned with the underlying infrastructure, and maybe they feel that if something were to go wrong, then the ultimate ledger would be managed by Tether itself, and effectively Tether maintains an off-chain ledger of their own, where they can step in if something goes terribly wrong."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Yeah, and this is very salient to our current discussions: the other thing is that, if you talk to a central banker about the cryptocurrency space, and you ask them, What are you nervous about? They will almost always say stablecoins! They typically don\u2019t say Bitcoin! I don\u2019t know if this has been your experience as well? But it\u2019s certainly the case with me. Central bankers are fixated on stablecoins, and really, Libra is actually the one they care the most about. But increasingly, also, the stablecoins that exist on-chain. So stablecoins have catalyzed a lot of keen investigation on the part of central banks and financial regulators into the crypto space, and they could be the element of this industry that actually gets governments to care about it, and attempt to crack down on it. Because all of these central bankers are pretty afraid of \u2014 not necessarily Bitcoinization \u2014 but involuntary dollarization, whereby they lose their monetary privilege, because stablecoins become so frictionless and easy to acquire that there\u2019s a currency substitution that occurs in their country. And for sure this is something that\u2019s happening in Venezuela today, it\u2019s happened historically in Equador \u2014 not with crypto rails, of course, but with physical dollars \u2014 so it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that this totally is possible. So the way that that could affect Bitcoin would just be by causing a regulatory hammerblow to fall on the industry. Now I think that we all expect and hope that Bitcoin is sufficiently robust that it can deal with that if the time comes, but that\u2019s another part of the bear case is that the stablecoins provoke governments into cracking down pretty hard on the industry."}

On your question about the US government I would say it\u2019s a little more nuanced. I mean, the government does issue the world\u2019s reserve currency and they wield strong benefits from doing that, but they don\u2019t want dollars to be percolating out into the world through a means that they don\u2019t control. And currently they don\u2019t control stablecoin infrastructure. You know, it\u2019s run as a protocol by a bunch of nodes. And so, that\u2019s also part of the reason we\u2019ve seen a bunch of policymakers in the US express their misgivings about it, even if it is effectively adding demand to the dollar, and potentially exporting the dollar overseas. It\u2019s doing it in a way that\u2019s outside the New York based correspondent banking system, outside of their surveillance apparatus.

I guess the main one that I can think of is just that it helps the overall liquidity and greasing the wheels for people to move through the exchanges and through different, other businesses and products and services that can be built using stablecoins that weren\u2019t otherwise possible with Bitcoin. What\u2019s your view on that kind of idea?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter [52:04]: Yeah, so that\u2019s undeniably a positive for Bitcoin. Just more liquidity, better connectivity between exchanges. So if you\u2019re [into] dislocations and into exchange prices \u2014 the existence of stablecoins mean that these arbitrage funds can operate in a capital efficient way, which is good for Bitcoin liquidity. I would say that that\u2019s the number one way. But the number two thing I would point you to would be, stablecoins might be penetrating a global audience of potential Bitcoin adopters before they have the experience of using Bitcoin. So, right now, the first experience most people have with cryptocurrency is with Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of been the default way that people get exposure to storing cryptographic information, storing value in the form of key pairs. And getting used to that concept. But it could be the case that, in a couple of years time, the default that people would get exposure to this concept \u2014 this is a transition that people need to go through: understanding information as value. We\u2019ve never really had to deal with that before. The default way they might do that would be through a stablecoin lens. Bitcoiners might not like hearing that, but it\u2019s totally possible in my mind, that that\u2019s the more immediately addressable way that people get exposure to digital assets, basically. And I think that could actually be an accelerant to the whole concept, and let people go through that learning experience, and then when they\u2019re ready, they could level up and then go to non-state monetary assets like Bitcoin. I think that\u2019s another way is that it penetrates a slightly different niche. It\u2019s people that maybe want dollars, and they\u2019re willing to consider this alternative infrastructure for those dollars, and once they\u2019re onboarded onto that and they\u2019re mentally ready, then they can make the leap to Bitcoin. So that would be the second way I think it could be really positive for Bitcoin. The third thing, and this is already a feature of the market, is that stablecoins only exist because of Bitcoin, and a lot of these stablecoin pairs are only liquid in a lot of these markets also because of Bitcoin. There\u2019s plenty of stablecoin usage in Venezuela, but that market was bootstrapped by the LocalBitcoins peer to peer market, where Bitcoin was obviously the main asset. So Bitcoin is this kind of non-state asset which is available globally, permenantly. It\u2019s the asset against which stablecoins trade most of the time. So Bitcoin is the true, ultimate clearinghouse of value, and then stablecoins are trading against Bitcoin. So it gives stablecoins a liability-free pair to trade into, and the way I see it is, we\u2019re getting progressive waves of regulation here, and so the popularity of stablecoins is gonna rise and fall over the years as regulators get more and less onerous. But Bitcoin will always be there, and at the times when nation-states are more hostile to stablecoins, more value will flow back into Bitcoin. And then as things open up again, some value will flow back into stablecoins, as the perceived risk declines. And so I think you just get this back and forth, but the constant is that Bitcoin is always gonna be there as this capital sanctus, to satisfy this demand, and to be this monetary constant, with stablecoins waxing and waning around Bitcoin. So it\u2019s a difficult concept to express, but Bitcoin\u2019s permanent presence in these markets is what permits stablecoins to work. So stablecoins certainly need Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need stablecoins, but I think it certainly benefits from their existence."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Absolutely! And the thing I didn\u2019t mention is that I believe that stablecoins will be issued against Bitcoin in the future. And we probably aren\u2019t going to have to wait that long for that to happen. There are already stablecoins being issued against spot Bitcoin, where you short Bitcoin, and you have a spot long position, and that bundle of the two creates a dollar-stable position. So that\u2019s one way that some people are creating a stablecoin against Bitcoin. But you could also do it in a Maker style, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the smart contracting ability in Bitcoin is gonna progress in the future to a state where it\u2019s totally possible to build the equivalent of Maker on Bitcoin. And then we\u2019ll just take the most successful concepts in DeFi and apply them to Bitcoin in a trust-minimized way. And if you look at DAI, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins on Ethereum. It really punches above its weight in terms of its philosophy. So I think the Bitcoin equivalent would also be pretty popular, honestly. A Bitcoin-native dollar-stable asset, facilitated and issued against Bitcoin collateral \u2014 I think that is a good idea. And so I do expect that in the future, Bitcoin will be a reserve asset for the issuance of stablecoins, and of course that will increase the reservation demand for Bitcoin. So that\u2019s kind of the final thing: stablecoins are strong evidence of the fact that people desire dollar-denominated liquidity on-chain. And they\u2019re willing to issue it against crypto-collateral. And I think Bitcoin is obviously the best form of collateral on-chain, because it has the best volatility characteristics and it obviously has the best monetary characteristics. I do think that it\u2019s gonna be another way that proves out the value of Bitcoin as this base monetary asset."}

One example I can think of right now, Blockstream Green: you can have liquid Tether on there and you can have Bitcoin on there. Is that a scenario that might play out over the next few years, where there might be some people who come into just having some Tethers in a phone wallet, and then eventually they start seeing, obviously, Number go Up, and then they start thinking, Oh! Hey! Why am I holding this USD Tether thing, I can hold some Bitcoin as well! Do you see that as a plausible story? Or as a potential method that software and Bitcoin wallets should be built out in?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter [59:15]: Well, I\u2019m not gonna prescribe any behavior to wallet developers. They definitely understand their users far better than I do. But there is something very convenient about multi-asset wallets, especially Blockstream Green \u2014 great, great example. I hear Liquid mentioned all the time in terms of more sophisticated, complex smart contracts on Bitcoin. I expect that some of the first stablecoins issued against Bitcoin will be Liquid assets, that exist on the Liquid sidechain. I also think we\u2019re gonna get a flavor of wallets that give you options in terms of de-risking your Bitcoin position, so maybe you\u2019ll be able to flip a switch and change your Bitcoin position to being market-neutral, and effectively flat in dollar terms. And maybe behind the scenes, there\u2019s some complicated on-chain derivative transaction that is going 1x short on that Bitcoin, and so you\u2019ve created an effective stablecoin against Bitcoin collateral. Those are the kind of things that are possible with more development, especially in the DLC space. I think Taproot is also gonna give us some more tools to do this. I don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s gonna look like, but I have no doubt in my mind that smart developers are gonna figure this out and we\u2019re gonna have a much broader arsenal of risk-management products that are native, on-chain, Bitcoin-based, and trust-minimized."}

Or a similar idea I guess. One other topic that I think we obviously should hit as well, which is stablecoin regulation. Recently there was this whole blow-up on Twitter about the Stable Act. Can you tell us a little about, first of all, what is that, and then what was your reaction to that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: There\u2019s a lot of interpretations and authors of the Stable Act have done themselves no favors by spouting off on Twitter which really muddied the waters, honestly. The Stable Act at its core basically says: stablecoin issuers need banking licences to operate. And their interpretation of stablecoins is that, these issuers are engaged in a banking depository style activity, and as such, they should be regulated by the state as banks. And anybody that understands what it\u2019s like to get a bank charter knows that this is an absurd proposition, because bank charters are incredibly difficult to come by, they require something like $20 million in paid up capital. Nobody gets bank charters anymore, at least in the US. The number of banks that exist just continues to decline year after year, and there\u2019s really been a stark decline in the number of banks in the US over the last 40 years. What this really is, is an attempt to nationalize a private sector industry which has been doing really well! And I\u2019m ultimately sympathetic to the core idea, which is: fiat-backed stablecoins should be more transparent about their reserve quality, and they should give depositors assurances that the stablecoins are actually backed on a one-to-one basis with actual dollars in a bank account. I\u2019m totally sympathetic to that idea, and it should be the case that there is some mechanism for them to prove that. I would be in favor of something like the FinTech charter \u2014 which Brian Brooks proposed \u2014 which would be a modified bank charter which takes note of the idiosyncrasies of the FinTech provider. Or something like an expansion of the special purposed despository institution, which is really suited for stablecoins. SPDIs in Wyoming, they are only entitled to hold a full reserve of the asset that they\u2019re custodying, so they can\u2019t operate fractionally. That\u2019s kind of what a stablecoin is! Stablecoins are meant to not be fractionally reserved, they\u2019re meant to be fully reserved. So there are a lot of interesting proposals for alternative bank charters. But the problem with the Stable bill is that it was just trying to treat these things like actual, regular commercial banks that engage in maturity transformation and engage in lending, and are heavily regulated as a consequence. But stablecoin issuers don\u2019t do any of this stuff! They just immobilize deposits in commercial banks and they issue IOUs that circulate on-chain against those deposits that are convertible for them. So the instrument that is being proposed\u2014as the solution to this issue of auditability \u2014 is an incredibly blunt and ill-fitting one, in my opinion. So that\u2019s the problem with the act, in my opinion. It takes this really archaic view of stablecoin issuers as banks, and tries to force them into this template, which basically makes no sense."}

The Senate is Republican, and the House is Democratic, so I doubt there\u2019d be bipartisan unity on this topic. And also we have allies in the Senate and the House now. I think it\u2019d be unlikely for something like this would pass now. It\u2019s actually more broad-reaching in the language in the bill than just stablecoins. It would actually affect FinTech providers like Venmo, PayPal, any e-wallet where you can hold a balance. They would all be considered stablecoins under this bill, which is preposterous! It\u2019s an abuse of language! Nobody refers to those things as stablecoins. You don\u2019t say, Send me a $10 stablecoin transaction on Venmo, you just ask for your friend to Venmo you. The bill is authored in such a way that it would actually captural all of this activity under a broad net so it\u2019s just a poorly constructed bill."}

Although various legislative bodies are proposing them, not just in the US. I would say it would be welcome to have a specific kind of bank charter, which would be useful, which would suit stablecoin issuers. Because right now the way they\u2019re regulated is: they register as money services businesses with FinCEN, and that gives them obligations around money laundering, AML and KYC, and then they typically have to go after money transfer licences in a bunch of states. And that is not a homogenous regime. The process of getting those licences on a state by state basic is pretty onerous and the states aren\u2019t necessarily the best regulator for what those issuers are doing. In my view stablecoins are effectively narrow bank or money market mutual funds. They should probably be regulated as such. Look, I\u2019m not calling for more regulation, but if there is a regulatory instrument that\u2019s created, it should just be mindful of the way they actually operate and not treat them as banks, which they really are not!"}

Do you think they\u2019re gonna wax and wane through these cycles? But it sounds to me like your view is fundamentally bullish stablecoins, but in a way that\u2019s also bullish Bitcoin?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/8oJwjXG9Lgs", "title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "text": "Nic Carter: Well the demand for stablecoins has obviously been proved out this year. I mean we went from $4 billion in outstanding stablecoin float to start the year to $25 billion today, which is just unbelievable! It\u2019s just unbelievable! I mean, those numbers in any other context outside the crypto industry would be eye-watering. So there\u2019s no question that people want dollar-denominated liquidity on largely censor-resistant blockchain rails on a globalized format such that you can hold those coins in your own possession with a private key. So digital bearer assets, cash-like digital bearer assets, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there\u2019s huge demand in the world for that. Now the big, big question is, is the hammer gonna fall on the likes of Tether and maybe even USDC and all the other issuers? Are the regulators gonna get their way and come down on the issuers? If that\u2019s the case, the only stablecoins that\u2019ll be left will be the crypto-collaterized stablecoins like DAI, which are much harder to regulate against, because they are just created through smart contracts, as opposed to traditional commercial bank relationships. So there\u2019s one scenario where, there are adverse regulatory outcomes for stablecoin issuers, and the only model that really survives is the crypto-collateralized model. And then there\u2019s another scenario where stablecoin issuers continue to exist in this grey zone, and continue to be reasonably private and reasonably censor-resistant albeit not perfectly so, and they just keep growing. But I do wonder what is the end state of that? The only thing that constrains their capacity is the balance sheet of the commercial banks that are holding the reserves. But that is almost unbounded. So what happens if you get to $200 billion in stablecoin prefloat? There\u2019s probably a point where it becomes systemic and where bank regulators worldwide try to triangulate the banks that are holding reserves for these things. So I don\u2019t think that it can grow indefinitely. I do think that there is a Sword of Damocles hanging over at least the stablecoin industry in its current format, absent of any regulatory clarity. I don\u2019t have a firm answer on it, but I do feel that we\u2019re waiting for a hammer to fall which hasn\u2019t fallen yet! I don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s gonna take. I don\u2019t think Tether for instance can exist sustainably for the next 5 years."}

I mean, Bitcoiners really, they speak their truth and they all have a different perspective. And I love this perspective and it really helped me think through when I compare Bitcoin to buying real estate in Manhattan in the 1970\u2019s. I\u2019ll say something to my father now \u2014 I\u2019ll be like, Bitcoin is like buying real estate in Manhattan in the 70's!

I\u2019m gonna have to give credit to our missing patriarch, Trace Mayer, who\u2019s been disappeared since February, but he used to talk about the Bitcoin blockchain as real estate. And that you should get some of your own, some of this limited real estate. And then it just was a natural progression in my own mind. You know, So how much real estate in the Bitcoin blockchain is available to each person if it was cut up equally? That was my first thought and I said, Oh, that seems like some relatively easy math if I go get some numbers on about how many people are around, we could divide that into 21 million in Bitcoin times a hundred-million sub-units that we call satoshis. And so how much does each person get? It was two-hundred and some-odd thousand\u2014I\u2019m not the only person that came up with the number very close to that. Certainly, what number you use for total population is gonna make that vary a little bit. So I went to a bunch of websites to see if I could get some kind of an average. And then you can do the same thing with real estate. Basically you can look around and there have been plenty of people who have tried to map out, How much usable land is on the planet versus how much total land? How much is it used for farming, whatever. I tried to whittle it down to just the usable land that we have available to us as humans, whether it be for farming or for living, versus mountains and swamps that we can\u2019t do much with. So you get another number, you divide that by the amount of people that are out there and you say, Okay, well how much land would each person get if you cut it up equally? I forget the number, I\u2019d have to skim the article again. But I spent plenty of time checking my numbers. I ran the numbers Pierre! Just in case. [05:49] It\u2019s basic math, and so I tried lay it out in such a way that anybody can follow it, they can pretty much check, in the online version of the article, there\u2019s a hyperlink you can click on and see where I got my facts from. But it was quite interesting, I\u2019m looking at it now\u2014I pulled it up on another screen \u2014 231,000 satoshis per person! Based on 7.79 billion people on the planet. Depending on what 1 satoshi is worth, that could be a lot! You know, I like to think of satoshis as dollars. And $231,000 for everybody, that\u2019s a lot of wealth to work with \u2014 assuming it could buy what a dollar buys today. Yeah I just kept taking that example, that base example, and extrapolating it out to different things. The quote that you brought up was, If you took your fair share of Bitcoin but multiplied that out to what would one whole Bitcoin get you in equal amount of real estate, I think that\u2019s where you came up with \u2014 at the time the Bitcoin price was $9,000 \u2014 1,800 acres. It was a lot of acres of real estate for $9,000. Most people on the planet would buy that much real estate for $9,000 if they could, except, there are places in the world where that much real estate\u2019s not even worth $9,000. But we\u2019re talking about valuable real estate that people want. [07:08] And so, if you were giving that up to me\u2014I guess that\u2019s what you were bringing up. I hadn\u2019t thought of real estate in the 70\u2019s in Manhattan. But when nobody really wanted it, because it was a beat-up city, you could get this stuff relatively cheap. You could extrapolate that out to Bitcoin, because we\u2019ve got a beat-up protocol \u2014 beat up by the media, let\u2019s say, that\u2019s working pretty good. People just don\u2019t wanna look at it! And you can get a piece of this stuff! It\u2019s going somewhere, folks! You just gotta get a little piece! It might turn out really well! Had I been in a position to purchase Manhattan real estate in the 70's \u2014 I was too young \u2014 but, had I understood the things I understand now I probably would\u2019ve tried to buy some. We gotta scarce resource here. There\u2019s only so much of it. If you can get yourself one Bitcoin, that\u2019s like \u2014 that\u2019s hard to fathom what that could represent in terms of the value, your purchasing power, in a hyperbitcoinization world, or a world where Bitcoin is the money that everybody uses. [08:08] As I said, if you have 231,000 satoshis \u2014 your fair share \u2014 and they\u2019re each worth a dollar, but you had one full Bitcoin? That\u2019s $100,000,000! So that\u2019s like the equivalent of you, right now, let\u2019s just say you had $100,000,000 \u2014 yeah, you\u2019d be doing pretty good! And you\u2019d be doing better than most people on the planet, alright? There\u2019s not that many people who have that much money. So, yeah this Bitcoin thing. It really fascinated me, and it just kept gnawing at me, these concepts, until I just kept \u2014 I would write a little bit, type a little bit on my computer, and then one day I put it into a Tweetstorm. That\u2019s what I actually did first. In 2018 I linked up ten Tweets in a row with this idea. And then when I saw Citadel 21 was asking for articles, and I thought, You know? I could turn that into an article pretty easy. So that\u2019s what I did, and @hodlonaut was nice enough to publish it for me. So that\u2019s the basic story there."}

And I love when you break it down to like, It\u2019s beer money! You know, you can get these 231,000 satoshis for like \u2014 now, the price has gone up a little bit \u2014 maybe $35? $30? And then you start thinking about, What if you did that every week? It\u2019s like buying a skyscraper in Manhattan in 1972 for $10,000! And maybe not having a tenant right away. It really helped me outline this argument when I talk to people about the asymmetric bet, and try to equate it to what you were saying with Trace. I remember those conversations where, You\u2019re buying a piece of the network. You own this real estate on the network. Because it\u2019s yours until you move it, or use your key to release it."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim [09:49]: Right. It\u2019s a scarce amount. There\u2019s only so much, and if you can get a piece of it, and other people are gonna want some of this real estate in the future, then you have a little bit of leverage there. You have some value there that people want and you could use that to live off of, to trade for things. The whole point of money is to store value, and this Bitcoin blockchain that was invented, stores value pretty well so far. And there\u2019s only so much of it that you can have available to store that value, and so if you get a piece of it \u2014 yeah it\u2019s an interesting concept: I heard people discuss squeezing more value into Bitcoin. At first I couldn\u2019t understand what that actually meant. So you\u2019ve got these 21 million Bitcoin, each one of \u2019em breaks up into 100,000,000 smaller units, and so, the value of any one of those units can be worth any amount of money. It\u2019s all what we decide to put on it, as far as value. So, how does it get value? Somebody has one of these Bitcoin, and somebody else says, I got this, and I\u2019ll give it to you. So typically that\u2019s dollars or Yen \u2014 some other form of money that the person who has the Bitcoin can go and use it for something. So [if] the person that has the Bitcoin feels that the dollars they\u2019re getting are worth it right now, because I need those dollars, I gotta go spend \u2019em on something \u2014 let me give up this Bitcoin because it\u2019s a good amount in exchange for maybe what I paid for it. Then the exchange goes through! Now, if not enough people recognize that value, they\u2019re not gonna trade. If they think their Bitcoin\u2019s worth more, they\u2019re gonna hold onto it. So now the next person comes along and says, Hey I wanna get some of that Bitcoin stuff, I\u2019ll give you a little more! Because there\u2019s only so many of \u2019em around, and so this is the market that we\u2019re watching now: it\u2019s expanding, as more and more people want little pieces of this scarce pie of digital real estate. They have to bid the price up because the people that have it aren\u2019t so willing to give it up anymore! They\u2019re starting to come to the realization that it\u2019s been working for 12 years straight. As a money it works really well in terms of storing value and transferring value around the world. We\u2019ve talked \u2014 I know you\u2019ve had many people on your podcast talk about the aspects of money that make a good money. Portability, divisibility, fungibility, verifiability, scarcity. So Bitcoin has all those things better than any other money we\u2019ve seen on the planet and people are waking up to that. They\u2019re starting to see: Wow! This thing has these properties and it\u2019s been working and it\u2019s pretty secure and there\u2019s a lot of people that are not only working on it and believed in it, but defend it. You know, you and I are considered some of the cyber hornets and we attack when people try to tell us we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. Michael Saylor seems to feel that the community of cyber hornets are one of the white blood cells of this whole system. It\u2019s what keeps it working. We are defending this thing to the death! So much so that we\u2019ll do anything to keep it running! Whatever it means\u2014fix the code, create hardware wallets, create things that we call multisig, which is ways to use this protocol more efficiently, better for people, giving it more value. This is constantly happening every single day by tens of thousands of people all over the world that are not going to quit on this thing! [13:28] And Michael Saylor sees that and he goes, What a crazy ecosystem building around this digital protocol that was invented! It\u2019s absolutely fascinating! And it really is. This new invention, this new form of money that we\u2019ve taken to, that works so well \u2014 each little unit is become worth more and more and more! And you\u2019ve just gotta get your little tiny sliver, and it\u2019s very likely it\u2019s gonna go up! And while you brought up the beer money thing, my calculations at that time were basically, you needed about $20.79 to get your fair of Bitcoin. And that was when it was about $9,000 for a whole Bitcoin. And so I thought of that as beer money for\u2014not a heavy drinker. If it was a heavy drinker it would be more than that! But and I went out and I said, Okay, what if Bitcoin cost $10,000? What would it cost you \u2014 your fair share? Easy math: 23 cents. What if it was $20,000? $46.20. What if it was $1,000,000? What would your fair share \u2014 if the entire Bitcoin blockchain is divided amongst everybody on the planet \u2014 what would it cost you to get your fair share at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin? [14:35] And the number\u2019s only $2,310.65! Now, that\u2019s a number that almost anybody can divert out of their life. I mean, where I live in New York, most people make reasonable money \u2014 sure, there\u2019s very poor people on the planet that can\u2019t afford that, but my point is this: even at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin it\u2019s worth getting some! Right? Because it\u2019s just gonna keep going up! I wanted to extrapolate on this, which I did not do in the article. I have this other article in my head just based on the concept of Number go Up. And I\u2019m convinced that the value of Bitcoin\u2014if it maintains itself as a worldwide money \u2014 will never stop going up! And the basic premise behind my position is this: when you look around at the Earth, there\u2019s more value currently on this Earth than there ever was, ever. Listen to somebody like Jeff Booth, he\u2019ll tell you about how technology\u2019s deflationary, business owners are always trying to improve their efficiency, improve their profits. In a world that has sound money \u2014 not corrupt money like we have now \u2014 capitalism can flourish. So value is created when people can take their labor and natural resources and turn them into something. And somebody else does the same thing with their labor and natural resources and turns them into something. And then they find this medium in the middle that they can exchange with each other\u2014this thing called money\u2014and then, what you find is that through efficiencies and use of trade, the division of labor, humans are able to cumulatively continue to put more value on the Earth. [16:22] Now, if Bitcoin is the unit of currency that is needed to denominate all that value, someday, everything is priced in Bitcoin. And [if] the value of items on the planet continues to grow, but the supply of Bitcoin does not, then the value of every Bitcoin must always go up. It literally has to go up. It can\u2019t go any other direction unless we destroy \u2014 if we have a net negative amount of new value on the planet. So, we\u2019re destroying things all the time, but we\u2019re also producing more things at the same time. So if we\u2019re having a net destruction of value\u2014yes, the value of Bitcoin could go down. In a market where all of Bitcoin is as distributed as it\u2019s gonna be at any given moment\u2014let\u2019s say after 2140 when it\u2019s all been spit out of the system \u2014 now it has to find its way into the hands of other people. They have to trade for value to the people who have the Bitcoin \u2014 that form of money, right? So now it starts to get dispersed all over the world. [17:20] The amount of value on the planet continues to rise, indirectly! It\u2019s kind of the opposite of inflation, in the sense that, when they keep printing money, the value of your labor goes down\u2014 you need more money to buy things. In this case, you\u2019ll need less Bitcoin to buy things, because the value of each Bitcoin goes up relative to your labor. So, your labor becomes more valuable over time, and you need less of it to buy things, because the value of your money goes up. So it\u2019s so connected to productivity of human beings, but it\u2019s also very connected to the world having the ability to use a freely chosen market money that\u2019s not imposed on people by government. Because the reason we don\u2019t have real capitalism \u2014 we have crony capitalism \u2014 the reason we have those types of things is because government have taken control of the money and it\u2019s basically broken, and some people win and a lot of people lose. [18:17] I was thinking of another thing, I don\u2019t mean to skip around. When the government gets involved in stuff, which they fully have done this year with the whole COVID thing, they skew the real market, and resources get diverted in directions they never would\u2019ve got diverted. So, for example, there is an entire industry created around the building and distribution of masks \u2014 all over the planet! So if you are able to take advantage of that \u2014 you\u2019re in the clothing industry, or some other industry \u2014 you could just turn your production facility into something that builds masks, and package them and send them out and get them out there as fast as possible, you could take advantage of a government mandate that everybody felt that they had to go buy one and wear it! Now, the market did not want that! People did not ask for masks, they were told they had to wear them. The government created an artificial market, and resources \u2014 actual money, productivity, that people would\u2019ve went and bought movie tickets, or went and played golf, or bought themselves a nice steak\u2014they had to go buy some masks for their whole family, because the government screwed them over and skewed the free market. You can\u2019t do that when you can\u2019t control the money. When you can control the money, you can control people, you can control regulations, you control the police forces and the militaries that uphold all the rules that you decide, or your decrees on the rest of the populous. Yeah, it\u2019s terrible! Everything is messed up because money is broken. Everything gets fixed when Bitcoin is the money of the world. That\u2019s why we have the meme, Bitcoin Fixes This. But, I also believe Number goes Up is a very valid meme, because I do think Bitcoin\u2019s value will never stop going up!"}

Well, I was a bit of a rebel my whole life, so I didn\u2019t really like a lot of rules, especially the ones that didn\u2019t seem logical to me. But I did believe in government and the state and I used to vote and I used to think it all made a lot of sense. Until I got educated, and a lot of that education came to me after I found Bitcoin. One of the things I came to realize is Bitcoin is a type of truth, and you can\u2019t\u2014well let me back up again. Part of my upbringing is to take things apart, I want to see how things work. And in physics, in engineering and natural sciences, you don\u2019t get to dictate certain principles. They\u2019re just there! You have to work with them all the time. And so, I became aware of certain universal things about life, and whenever something didn\u2019t seem to make sense, I\u2019d want to get to the bottom of, How do you come to this conclusion on any given thing? And so Bitcoin is the kind of thing, when you study it, the logic is there, the mechanism of how it works and the game theory about why people are willing to always act in the right way to keep the system working. That stuff was really fascinating to me! What\u2019s going on in the world with governments deciding what to do, they\u2019re not following basic logic, basic first principles \u2014 it\u2019s so corrupted, that they control the money, that they can create situations that benefit some people over other people, and I think Bitcoin takes that away from them. If, in fact, we ever get to a point where Bitcoin is a world money. They can\u2019t make more of it and they can\u2019t pay off their crony friends and everything else. I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question directly enough, I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how you phrased it. I apologize."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim: To answer both questions, what it\u2019s about is the money \u2014 it\u2019s always been about the money. Once central banking was invented, I think in the 1600s, those people that were involved never stopped being involved. Their heirs and the people that were close to them kept central banking going as a concept. Ever since it was invented, it was enslaving humans. The people that run all the banks in the world are the people in control. They\u2019re in control of all the politicians. The politicians do not control the money. The money controllers control the money. So, this is literally what\u2019s going on: it\u2019s a select handful of humans that run this planet because they control money, and they control all the people who distribute the money, protect the money \u2014 all of that. So whether it\u2019s 400 families in this country or around the world, it\u2019s a select few, and all the people that have sworn their allegiance to those select few, this is why the cover-ups \u2014 you know, all the politicians, they all have dirt on each other. Hillary\u2019s never getting prosecuted. She\u2019s amongst some of the worst politicians we\u2019ve ever seen, in my opinion. But, you know, Donald will say how she\u2019s evil and this, that, and the other thing, but you just watch: he won\u2019t prosecute her. Biden certainly won\u2019t. She\u2019ll just keep going. None of \u2018em! None of \u2019em will! We\u2019ll never find out what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. No chance. None of the people are ever getting prosecuted, because it\u2019s a big club! And they control the media. The media gets paid off from very wealthy people, that\u2019s how they get their advertising. It\u2019s just a big money stream, and as soon as you take that power away from them, it just fizzles away. I wouldn\u2019t say for a long time. This is a couple generation thing that\u2019s gonna have to play out. They\u2019re not gonna give up easily, and there\u2019s a lot of people that benefit \u2014 even innocent people that benefit by the system that\u2019s been built. All the police and military, they get paid very well with all kinds of great benefits, are not necessarily trying to take over their fellow man. Some of them, you know, abuse their situation. They just want a good job with good pay, and they believe, they\u2019ve been indoctrinated to believe that this whole system is created to help everybody and protect everybody. Meanwhile, the politicians keep writing rules\u2014words on paper \u2014 that take more of our freedoms away, and these police that are being told by their immediate superiors and the ones over them and the ones over them, you must enforce these words on paper that we\u2019ve come up with. That\u2019s what this is all about! We\u2019re helping everybody! The sad part is, you just gotta look back in history. It\u2019s playing out, it\u2019s a broken record: you know, every dictator, every socialist communist regime, did the same thing. It\u2019s all for your protection. If everybody had guns it would be very dangerous. Therefore, everybody should not have guns. I mean, it\u2019s a joke! But they\u2019re trying it here in America. It\u2019s an interesting experiment, because in all other cases, citizenry of most other countries did not have huge amounts of weaponry to fight back with. This country is starting out \u2014 or at least, in this iteration of this country \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of weaponry out there to fight back against any form of state that might try to impose too much will on the people. I\u2019m shocked at all the people that walked around this entire country with masks everywhere! Like literally, it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much of a hassle to fight, I don\u2019t want to get my whole town to rally up and fight against this, so I\u2019ll just put on a mask. That\u2019s really sad, because that just shows how far the state has come with its ability to indoctrinate, to convince people to act in ways that they would not otherwise act, and what do they say? Well it\u2019s for the benefit of our neighbors! We gotta protect the elderly! You gotta help everybody! Yeah, okay, I\u2019m not in favor of ruining other peoples\u2019 lives, but I\u2019m also not in favor of you telling me how I should live my life. Or anybody else, for that matter. I think everyone should decide for themselves, take their own risks. Life is full of risks. That\u2019s never going away. Politicians can\u2019t make it go away. So everybody has to decide for themselves if they wanna take a risk. Decide for yourself if you believe these politicians that this virus is really dangerous, or go somewhere else and find somebody else that\u2019s telling you maybe it\u2019s not so dangerous. There\u2019s enough people on the Internet you can listen to that totally contradict the government\u2019s narrative. They\u2019re just not getting on the mainstream news. They\u2019re not getting on the TV, where the general public gets most of their information. So, most of society stays brainwashed, but plenty of people don\u2019t believe any of this! I have not believed it from the very beginning. This is just a big ruse to me. This flu thing, it\u2019s just maybe a slightly stronger version \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But when 99.95% of the people recover \u2014 no matter how sick they get \u2014 I don\u2019t know how you could tell me that the entire society needs to get locked down. Everybody needs to wear masks, and businesses being destroyed. All of the planet, for a virus that kills almost no one! This is absolute insanity! And yet, people still believe it! They still believe we need masks! It\u2019s absolute craziness! I know you commented on a Tweet I sent out \u2014 I was in New York City. [27:48] They\u2019re building little huts in the street! Because people aren\u2019t allowed in the building to eat dinner, but they can sit in a box in the street and eat the same dinner \u2014 what the hell? What is going on with the minds of people? How the hell \u2014 I can\u2019t fathom. There\u2019s no logic! There\u2019s no fricking logic, okay? I can\u2019t believe people. If I can\u2019t see the logic to it, then I\u2019m not going with you on this, I\u2019m sorry! So I was willing to consider at the beginning, it might be a dangerous virus. You saw video out of China, people falling all over in the streets, welding doors shut\u2014which is insanity to me \u2014 and I thought, Oh, man, that better not come here. Luckily, it hasn\u2019t. But I said, Alright, maybe it\u2019s bad. But even from the very beginning, the first week or two, when I was forced out of work, I thought, No way! And I work in a place that has no people around most of the time. So I thought, Now this is bullshit! This government, this little township that I work in, had the ability to close down the entire town and not let a single person work, in wintertime when most people are not there. It would be me and my crew on a job site, nobody around for miles potentially, and I\u2019m not allowed to go to work because some government bureaucrat deems the entire environment dangerous or some \u2014 who knows what? It\u2019s insanity! [29:03] And I started just immediately doing searches online. I gotta find out more myself, Is anybody saying anything other than the stupid government narrative? And immediately, there\u2019s answers everywhere! Scientists all over the planet that would refute everything Fauci tells you on the TV, or any of these other bureaucratic pencil-pushers. It\u2019s just too much to stomach. Look, I can ramble, my mind just goes in all directions. I hope I\u2019m hitting the things you wanted to get to."}

I love it. Let\u2019s stipulate that government controls the money, governments can do these things to people, and influence events. Let\u2019s compare this current environment to maybe Vietnam. Because it kind of came up on the show with JW Weatherman, and it took me a moment to think about this. Let\u2019s say that this is government overreach. And that it\u2019s horrible. But government has always overreached, maybe? I think that\u2019s an argument that I would stand by, and maybe Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan, or any of those things were overreach. [30:12] But then, you had to go to a foreign land and kill somebody. So just in terms of the lesser of two evils, which is not the road that I want to go down, but\u2014Is this worse? Better? Is this a different form of psychological warfare that is worse? Is it not as bad as getting a letter when you\u2019re 18 and having to go to another country to kill somebody, but bad in a different way? I\u2019m just trying to get some grounding for what 2020 is. I mean, I\u2019ve been fighting it all year\u2014to think of 2020 as the worst year of my life \u2014 because I want every year to be the best year of my life, and get better. So I\u2019m an optimist, and I\u2019ve been trying not to let it get me down or really get caught up in it. But then I take a moment back to when JW said, At least we\u2019re not going back to Vietnam and killing people \u2014 it really struck me as, Yeah! This is a really different year! But, how different, and on what level, and is it a lesser evil or a greater evil?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim [31:13]: Oh, okay. So, part of me wants to say it\u2019s a greater evil, because it\u2019s getting right into the brains of everybody in a way that \u2014 you know, it\u2019s one thing to believe in war in a foreign land, and for people to want to support their country, believing that they\u2019re fighting for freedom or democracy or whatever they think is some type of virtue that they believe they should go and fight for. But you don\u2019t have to brainwash everybody \u2014 well maybe you do, I don\u2019t know. Something about this scares me a little more. You know, like, I\u2019m gonna tell you about the Vietnam \u2014 you brought that up, I find that interesting that you should bring that up. I can vividly remember sitting on the front steps of my house growing up with my mother, and I was nine, and the Vietnam War was going, and I had heard about it and I didn\u2019t understand it, and I started asking her questions about it, like, Why do we have to do this? Why are people dying? Why are we way on the other side of the planet? [32:20] What\u2019s up with Vietnam? Why is that important to us? And she her best to answer my questions, and then we got up to talking about the draft. And I immediately, at nine years old, I\u2019m like, No way! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going! Not a chance in the world! And I asked my mother, what could I do if they told me I had to go? And she told me, straight at me, You\u2019d probably have to go to Canada. That was the first time in my life I\u2019d ever thought, Move out of the country? What\u2019s Canada? How far is it? I didn\u2019t know anything about that! But, I thought, Well, Canada it is then, if that\u2019s all it takes! I\u2019m going to Canada, man! I\u2019m not going across the planet to go kill some strangers! Just fundamentally it didn\u2019t seem right! I was just a kid, but whatever. Like, to think my parents raised me well, I don\u2019t know! So yeah, I don\u2019t agree with any of this, what government can do \u2014 at this point \u2014 generations of indoctrination through public school systems. I stood there, pledged allegiance to the flag like every kid. It\u2019s hard to believe the indoctrination that you\u2019re put through in public school. [33:23] At the time, I didn\u2019t see it. Nobody did. But the indoctrination that comes from that, then through television and movies, Hollywood, the newpapers, the media in general, it\u2019s all skewed basically to keep you believing that authority is there, it matters, and you can\u2019t stop it and you must heed to it. That is, this big monstrosity called government, is never going away, it controls a lot of stuff, and it\u2019s in your best interest, so don\u2019t try to fight it, right? And it\u2019s a good thing! We all need to get in line and listen to the boss. In school, they made us line up to walk down the hallways. Somebody\u2019s always in charge. And there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. It\u2019s the blind belief that you must listen to some person of authority no matter what they tell you! See, that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s okay to listen to authority \u2014 I\u2019m an authority at work, I tell people what to do all the time. But it\u2019s in their economic best interest to listen to me because if they do what I\u2019m asking then they\u2019ll get paid! Do they have to care what I want? No, they don\u2019t have to care. They just have to execute what I want, in order to get paid. [34:31] So there\u2019s certain ways that authority is perfectly fine. But when somebody\u2019s telling you to live your life a certain way that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise choose to do, that\u2019s crossing the line. That\u2019s violating the Non-Aggression Principle. You\u2019re in there trying to tell somebody else what they have to do, or something. Ultimately, it\u2019s what they have to do. It\u2019s fine to make suggestions. It\u2019s when you force somebody to do anything. So the government have gotten people so convinced that they have to listen to authority that they\u2019re willing to go around and wear masks all over the place \u2014 some people in their own cars by themselves, driving! Like, Wow, man! Are they that afraid of the air around them? I\u2019m blown away by the brainwashing! How deep it\u2019s gone! And I can just imagine those bankers of the world\u2014sitting there \u2014 I can imagine the evil villain in Batman rubbing his hands together, just laughing, Ha ha ha ha! Look at them! Look at all those crazy idiots just doing what we say! It\u2019s mind-boggling to think how much power a handful of people have on everybody else. Mind-boggling, to me. But, it\u2019s all because they control the money. It all gets fixes when the money gets fixed, literally. [35:40]"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim: So I would say that\u2019s always been in me, and I uncovered it. So I said earlier that I\u2019ve been a bit of a rebel my whole life\u2014I\u2019ve never liked authority. I\u2019ve always hated the police. I always hated stupid rules. Like, if the playground was closed but nobody was there and it was a sunny day, I thought, Why can\u2019t we go in the playground? What the hell is the gate closed for? Why does that matter? It\u2019s a damn playground and no one is using it! I just couldn\u2019t relate to those kind of stupid rules all over the world around me! So, it really wasn\u2019t until Bitcoin, honestly, because once I started to connect how the money creates all the other bull-crap in the world \u2014 because that\u2019s really what it took for me. I saw so much illogical, unreasonable stuff going on, I never believed or trusted much of what governments said, anyway. But I did not understand how it got created, and how it\u2019s able to perpetuate, until I understood money. [36:46] And this is again\u2014it\u2019s very convenient how public school systems do not teach how money came about in human history, what different forms of money, views for why some were better than others \u2014 none of that was taught. So it was only because of Bitcoin that I was able to learn the history of money, and then start to have the courage to go back to see how money is so connected to all the other human problems we all face. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, a broken money is the reason why our societies are broken at every level. Why one religious states hates another. If we all had one money to work with and trade with each other, everybody would just go in their own corner and hang out with their own people, their own types of people, get along fine, I\u2019d go hang out with surfers, the skiers can go hang out with the skiers. Everybody would leave everybody alone, for the most part, if nobody had control over the economy. Like I said earlier, the government skews the free market, it puts incentives in place they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be in. So now, human beings gotta take their resources and divert them in ways they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do. And they\u2019re not always in their direct best interest. Sometimes they\u2019re doing it because the government\u2019s making them do it. I follow a lot of rules in the construction industry where I\u2019m at, and a lot of those rules cause extra costs. And some of those rules are reasonable, in the sense that they make a building safer or whatnot, but some of them are absolute bullshit all day long, and they just enrich one industry, or \u2014 just the idea that you have to get permission to build a house, so you gotta go pay somebody some money to say, Oh yeah, we\u2019ve looked at your plans, and we\u2019re gonna let you build it. Meanwhile, you own the land, and none of your neighbors seem to care, but you gotta go pay some money you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have to pay, to some other human being who has said \u2014 who has written words on paper \u2014 we get to control you and guess what? You only get to act if you pay us. [38:38] That is so broken! That is not how free people work! Again, I feel like I\u2019m going off on a tangent, but my mind just keeps going along."}

Yeah, I\u2019m looking to hear from your mind! I\u2019m curious, what was it that spoke to you clearly about Bitcoin in terms of like, was it a particular \u2014 and Bitcoin and money. Or reality. What were some of the things that crystallized it for you, whether it was Bitcoin or not?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim: I\u2019ll tell you exactly. I had three touches. First touch was somebody told me about Bitcoin, a young guy I know, who is into gaming, he was talking about Internet money, I thought it had something to do with gaming. I wasn\u2019t into gaming, so I literally never even looked at it. Second time was going through Netflix on the TV, I saw a documentary on Bitcoin. I was curious, I like documentaries in general. So I watched it, but at the end of it, it looked a little too complicated and not necessarily going anywhere. I think that was about 2015. [39:38] But then I was walking my dog, listening to YouTube, I had figured out that, on YouTube, there is a lot of interesting information and went and got myself an unlimited data plan, so I can just listen to anything I want on YouTube and walk the dog, or wherever else I was going. And then I start to learn about YouTube and they feed you things, based on what you\u2019d listen to in the past. So they\u2019ll make suggestions. So I started listening to several different TED talks, and eventually I came across one, this woman was talking about\u2014it could have been about Bitcoin \u2014 but she connected with me because she related Bitcoin to trust. And I can\u2019t even tell you exactly how she described it, but it piqued my attention, because as I\u2019d referenced earlier, I work at a summer community on a barrier island called Fire Island. And when I\u2019m working there all winter long, the homeowners are nowhere to be found. And they have to trust me! And what I came to realize when I started my business over there\u2014with a perfectly clean slate and basically no reputation \u2014 was the fact that, if I do a good job, and build a level of trust with the first couple of customers, maybe they\u2019ll tell one of the people and I can build on that. But the thing is, you can never break that trust. You always have to come through. You make a mistake, you honestly own up to it, fix it, do whatever you gotta do, so that those people never lose trust in you, that they can be away from their project, and you can do it without cutting corners and screwing them over. And I learned it by asking people, How did you come to meet? What happened to your last contract? And one woman in particular told me a story where a contractor said that a job was done in the spring, sending the balance, anticipating he would get back to finish it before she showed up, and she showed up and it wasn\u2019t really done. So he lied to her, he got paid, and then he had to, you know, make up some excuse and come back and then she was like, I\u2019m never hiring you again! So I learned this thing about trust very early on when I was trying to get my business off the ground, that you cannot mess with this thing called trust. Now when this lady connected Bitcoin with trust, I had to know why she meant that. I wanted to know what was this thing\u2014Bitcoin, why was it so tied to trust?\u2014that had piqued my interest, and what could that mean to me? And I had already learned enough about it, I had watched the documentary, I understood it to be some digital money. But I didn\u2019t recognize the trust component of it, and so really was what sent me down the rabbit hole. [42:02] That caused me to now search out podcasts of anything Bitcoin, so I could learn, How does it work? And what is it about trusting or not trusting that\u2019s going on here? And so we have that saying in Bitcoin, Don\u2019t trust, verify. The idea is that you don\u2019t trust anybody in Bitcoin. She was talking about it in a way that you could transfer money basically without having to trust that the money wasn\u2019t going to show up, or anybody in the middle was gonna steal it. She was trying to reference the fact that, once you understand how the Bitcoin blockchain works, it\u2019s very trustable. But you don\u2019t have to trust somebody telling you that. The good thing about Bitcoin is that it\u2019s open source and if you don\u2019t know how to read code, you can go learn to read code. You could hire someone that could read code. You could eventually get to the bottom line of Bitcoin and decide for yourself if you should trust it. That\u2019s what got to me \u2014 as I was learning about Bitcoin, I recognized that, you know, I can\u2019t read code, so I can stay for the rest of my life not trusting this protocol. Or, I could learn as much can about it that I can understand, then trust other people who have studied it, if I so choose to. And so one podcast, one interview after another, one article after another, I came to a belief that enough people have tested this stuff that don\u2019t have any skin in the game to tell me otherwise \u2014 they\u2019re not trying to sell me anything! They\u2019re not getting my money to convince me to jump into this thing! There is so much content, I was very fortunate because this was early 2017. There was already a good enough amount of content that I could cross-check one podcaster after another, and see, What is this guy saying? What is that guy saying? And I got to look back at videos from the early days of Bitcoin from 2012 and 2013. At MIT Blockchain consortium, or whoever they were, putting out, literally, educational seminars at college level! The stuff that you don\u2019t find on Bitcoin Twitter or anything anymore. It\u2019s buried now, it\u2019s too old or whatever! But I was just that kind of person, I had to know! So that did it for me \u2014 the idea that you didn\u2019t have to trust the protocol, but you could trust it once you understood it\u2014was fascinating to me! And then extrapolate that out into how money worked, and why it\u2019s so broken, and why we can\u2019t trust politicians anymore, and all this other stuff that\u2019s so related to good money working properly. That was it! I was down the rabbit hole and no way I\u2019m ever going out again! [44:28] I mean, it\u2019s too deep! There\u2019s so much to learn. There\u2019s so much about this, it\u2019s just so fascinating."}

So you gain this conviction and you\u2019ve got trust now in this system, or you\u2019re learning that you shouldn\u2019t trust things\u2014you verify it yourself. And I get going to conferences and talking to other Bitcoiners, but you\u2019re an individual thinker. You\u2019re a free thinker. You\u2019re your own person. What\u2019s driving you to print up double-sided business cards and hand them out with information on where you can go learn about Bitcoin? Why aren\u2019t you just buying your $20 and getting your fair share and moving on with your life?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim [45:17]: Alright, well. We all have a reason to want to live, right? I think if you have no reason to live then you might as well stop. There\u2019s a couple of things in there. I gotta lot of life behind me, so I think I\u2019ve got some wisdom that I think some people might benefit from. So I learned a long time ago that we go some stages in our lives, where we first \u2014 there\u2019s Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs\u2014you\u2019ve gotta get survival first. Stephan Covey in his book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People puts it this way: We first must live, then we love, then we learn, then we want to leave a legacy. So there\u2019s four L\u2019s. So in living, we just gotta survive, and you don\u2019t really care about anything else if you\u2019re struggling for survival. But once you get that, you tend to want to have relationships for love. It\u2019s what help bring a little bit of fun to life. So you got survival, you got some relationships. And then, it turns out, most people want to grow! They\u2019re curious! And so they end up wanting to learn. [46:22] So I\u2019ve been down those roads, I\u2019ve done all that. I have my survival, I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019ve got lots of great relationships all of my life. I\u2019ve been learning forever. But then it comes to \u2014 what does all this matter? What does it mean? Am I going to leave any kind of legacy on this planet whatsoever? There\u2019s billions of people that have come and gone and none of us know who they were. None of us. There\u2019s only a handful of people that have any kind of legacy on this planet. I don\u2019t expect to have one. I\u2019m too small of a fish in a giant pond! But, I can still have an effect on people individually. And that could have a ripple effect. The exponential effect: if I affect two people and they affect two people. So my efforts could actually help millions of people down the road that will never know that I had an effect on their future or will never know me, but if I stick to first principles, honesty and integrity, and truth, then I feel like any effort I put in that direction is not wasted. That I feel like my life was not wasted. And even if I am not known the world over as somebody important on this planet, I know that I\u2019ve done the best that I could with what was given to me. I didn\u2019t squander it. I tried to live an upstanding, honorable life, and then pass that forward! Pay it forward to somebody else that could use either my experience or simply my knowledge. People don\u2019t know about this money. [47:45] I\u2019m gonna back this up and say, if I was to give an elevator pitch to somebody and I had no idea where they were coming from, I would say, Money is the most important invention humans have ever come up with. It allows the division of labor, it allows us to get away from bartering, it allows us to trade, and it increases the value on the planet. Bitcoin is the best iteration of money that humans have ever come up with. Because it\u2019s got all the best properties of money, plus some additional ones that previous forms of money did not have. If Bitcoin is the best form of money, and money is the best invention humans have ever come up with, Bitcoin, by default, is the most important and best invention humans have ever come up with. Now, if you don\u2019t want to go shout that to the world, I don\u2019t know what to say! It\u2019s like Michael Saylor saying, Is this a non-correlated asset or is this fire that will change humanity, right? Bitcoin is gonna change humanity. It\u2019s not just a non-correlated asset. It\u2019s not just an investment. This is the best form of money, which allows pure economic calculation for every human on the planet! Free and fair trade for everybody! Productivity and prosperity for everybody on the planet, because this invention is now here! This is the most important thing ever created, ever. And we are living in one of the most important and influential times in all of human history, where we are watching humanity adopt a free market money that cannot get corrupted by governments. Gold was the best thing we had, but it got corrupted. This Bitcoin thing, I don\u2019t see anybody explaining how it\u2019s gonna get corrupted. It\u2019s set up in such a way that it can\u2019t be. The game theory is so perfect \u2014 at least so far \u2014 that it\u2019s fascinating. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, I can\u2019t not talk about this. Future generations need people like us to not give up. We will be talked about a hundred or a thousand years from now, like, Man, those people were strong believers! Had they not done this for us, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. We need to thank our ancestors. It\u2019s that kind of thing, that I believe we\u2019re all living in. We have to stand up against the craziness that\u2019s out there. We have to push it in everyone\u2019s faces that you\u2019re missing out! This is not only good for you, this is good for all of humanity. This is not a selfish thing on my part \u2014 sure, if more people adopt it, will the number go up? Will my Bitcoin be worth more? Of course it will! But if you don\u2019t adopt it, somebody else will. There\u2019s enough people on this planet. We don\u2019t need everybody to adopt it for this thing to be worth value, and for the rest of the world to be forced into adopting it. So everybody that I could talk to could ignore me, and Number will still go Up, because millions of people get convinced by someone else other than me. It really doesn\u2019t matter if my efforts are wasted. They\u2019re in the right place, and hopefully, it ripples out into the energy of the world in a positive way, affects lots of people, and humanity is better off in the long run. That\u2019s all I really want to see, is a happy, peaceful world, where everybody leaves everybody alone, and if you wanna go surfing you can go surfing, if you wanna read a book on a mountaintop you can go do that, that some government is not gonna come along and say, Sorry you\u2019re out of bounds! Oh, you out there in the ocean? Come in, you need to wear a mask! I mean, did you see the videos back in the early part of the year? Guy out on a paddle-board by himself in the ocean and the cops were calling him in, because he\u2019s supposed to be in his house or something. Give me a break! Oh, man. This is important stuff! We gotta get the word out. I don\u2019t care if I make a dime off this directly because of my words. Literally. You know, there\u2019s another thing: people often talk about, when left up to the market, you have this thing called the tragedy of the commons, where people won\u2019t take care of the things that they don\u2019t want to own. That\u2019s not true at all. I don\u2019t own Bitcoin, and I\u2019m taking care of it like it\u2019s my most precious little baby, right? And everybody in this space feels exactly like me! And I got out of my way, for free, to talk to you or anybody else that will listen, because \u2014 I\u2019m not trying to get paid directly for my efforts here. These efforts are important not just for me, but for a lot of people beyond me. When the politicians talk about, We\u2019re all in this together! Yeah, we are when it comes to something like money, that helps us all, that takes the power away from some parasite humans. Yeah, we\u2019re all in this together. In that regard, I feel very connected to everyone of the other humans on this planet. We\u2019re definitely all in this together. But as far as the way that they want things to go, No, we\u2019re not all in this together \u2014 because they just say how it goes and we\u2019re supposed to just listen. So, this is super important stuff and I\u2019m super passionate as you can hear. And I\u2019ll never stop talking about Bitcoin, and I\u2019ll never stop trying to convince people that they should get as much of it as possible. And hopefully that article I wrote convinces a few people, we\u2019ll see! I appreciate you promoting it, I see you re-tweeting it and stuff so that\u2019s very nice of you! And the more people the better, we just gotta get the word out! You know, that article will never change \u2014 other than the price of Bitcoin, the fundamentals in that article will never change, and I\u2019m glad I wrote it because somebody many years from now can read it and they can still get the point. There\u2019s nothing about that that\u2019s ever going to not be the same. Well, you could change the numbers in terms of the amount of people. The Bitcoin will never change, the amount of land will never change, so just change the numbers around, but the principles will never change. Get yourself some of this limited stuff, because it\u2019s probably gonna be good for you."}

I think every Bitcoiner has something to add, and a different perspective that is incrementally adding to the canon. And I did love the article, and I revisit it a lot, because it\u2019s building on the conversation that Trace was having that got in my head about real estate. If we were to look at the world from first principles, and align with first principles, and we\u2019re looking at: engineering, accounting, math, integrity, honesty, trust and trustworthiness, music, food, peace, contentment, sex, self-actualization, rational self-interest, kindness, and most importantly peace and love, how should Bitcoin be viewed as part of the universal energy of our existence?

{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim: Okay, I had a feeling that you would ask me something around this. So, I had to give this a lot of thought. Anybody who\u2019s taken a basic statistics course will be able to understand what a bell curve is, and that we can look around at things and we can get generalizations about a lot of things, but never necessarily 100%, that\u2019s why in the middle of the bell curve, that\u2019s where the averages are gonna be, that at the tail ends that\u2019s where the outliers are gonna be. But there\u2019s something about physics and engineering that\u2019s definite. So let\u2019s just take gravity for example. We can measure gravity in different ways, but it never stops. It\u2019s always acting upon us, and we\u2019re stuck with it. We have to figure out to the best of our knowledge what it\u2019s doing to us and how can we use it or overcome it. So there are principles about the way waves move \u2014 sound waves, water waves. There are principles that govern the vibration of molecules, at least to the extent that humans have been able to visualize or observe these things and measure these things. So on a molecular level, we can almost anticipate \u2014 it\u2019s like action, reaction. If this happens, we can anticipate that will happen. So if we heat up some water, eventually when that water temperature gets to 212 degrees it\u2019s gonna start boiling. It happens every single time\u2014we can count on it, right? That\u2019s because, in physics, the molecules, they act a certain way and they always act that way when given the same parameters. So in this case you add heat, you add enough heat, the molecules speed up, it turns into a boil. Nothing\u2019s ever gonna change that! All we can do is work with it. So these first principles that are all over the place are there, they\u2019re acting on us. Another interesting thing I noticed when I was watching a slow-motion video had to do with music notes. And I found it interesting that when you take a note, any note, and you photograph a guitar string and you watch the vibration of that note, and you go up one octave or go down one octave, the speed at which the string vibrates is exactly double or exactly half. Literally exactly! And there\u2019s a principle going on there! It\u2019s the way energy flows. And so, there\u2019s a lot of principles that are acting all around us, all the time. When we align ourselves with those principles, things work out. When we don\u2019t align with them, they don\u2019t work out. Let me take it to an example with surfing: so when I\u2019m trying to go surfing, I gotta deal with a whole bunch of physics that I have nothing to do with. Wind makes waves, those waves come towards the beach, the bottom contour forces the waves to rise up, they peel in a certain given direction\u2014but every wave is a little bit different \u2014 and the wind, the tide, they all can affect it. But in general, I\u2019m gonna want to paddle towards the beach, I\u2019m gonna want to get up to the same speed as the wave, I\u2019m gonna want to stand up and, using the physics of my board, lean on the board in such a way that it makes turns in the direction I want it to go, and then I get to ride the energy of this wave that\u2019s moving towards the beach whether I\u2019m there or not. So the physics involved with all of that, when you go back to the bell curve, there\u2019s a billion, gadrillion, gazillion variations on that single wave, me riding it, and my position on that wave. [57:35] If I was six inches over when I started my paddling, my wave would\u2019ve been different. When I stood up, if my feet were one centimeter a little [more] forward than they were, my ride would\u2019ve been different. So, the principles underlying what combination is gonna give you what outcome \u2014 they\u2019re there, they\u2019re set in stone by the universe. It\u2019s what combination of those principles that we put together that gives us our outcome. So, you go surfing at the very same surf spot where the wave peels in the same direction every time, and still, every wave is different, every time you stand up you gotta find the right spot on your board, and then, you have to look at that wave as it\u2019s rising up in front of you and constantly make adjustments to get your ride and go down the line and get that enjoyment out of that. And all of that is based on physics that you don\u2019t get to control, other than your own motion! It\u2019s like, you have to blend you with the energy around you. We are doing this over time. When we listen to music that we like, we are blending our brainwaves with harmonic resonance of sound that is pleasing to us, it comes through! When two notes are dissonant from each other, our brains don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s an interesting phenomenon in photography, that generally, people like pictures that are divided up like a tic-tac-toe board, it\u2019s the rule of thirds. So you can look at many, many photographs that are cut up into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and something about our human nature likes that. We tend to gravitate towards things that conform with a certain energy that we as humans find pleasing. I think it translates into food, although I\u2019m far from any kind of food connoisseur. But there are certain foods that, when combined together, enhance both of the things put together, and other combinations that completely destroy each individual ingredient. And there\u2019s something about a harmonic resonance of the molecules on our taste buds, that we love this combination, we hate that. And that\u2019s generally true! Will some people like music that\u2019s out of tune? Yeah! They\u2019re at the very tail end of the bell curve. Whereas, everybody else is generally in the middle \u2014 when the music\u2019s in tune, and it follows the scale, and the notes come together right. You end up in the middle of the bell curve where almost everybody seems to think it\u2019s good. It sounds generally pleasing. [59:56] The same with things we see, and so there\u2019s a scale \u2014 on the bell curve \u2014 from one end to the other, going through the middle, where you find the bulk of everybody. So those are the things where we are interacting with the world around us. There\u2019s this phrase\u2014I wish I could think of it \u2014 that describes the grey areas between every variation of any system. But the principles of nature are underlying all of this, and they never change. These are the first principles. So when you said it, you made a list of things, because I wrote them down. So something like truth, is a principle. Now it\u2019s not a physics principle, it\u2019s not an engineering principle like building a building where the structure\u2019s gonna collapse if you use the wrong materials, but truth is one of these things that\u2019s an underlying principle. When you have truth, you have the ability to trust. What we find when we\u2019re trusting something, we are trusting the overlapping of character and competence. So we\u2019re trusting somebody\u2019s character \u2014 are they truthful in how they are. Do they seem honest? But what we\u2019re also trusting is someone\u2019s competence \u2014 do they know what they\u2019re talking about? And so, when you\u2019re trying to find truth, you\u2019re trying to also extrapolate trust and trustworthiness in order to find that truth, so you gotta dig down into these things in order to know if truth is actually there. But truth is there somewhere! It\u2019s a matter of trying to uncover it. One of the things we say in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is just a big truth machine. Because it keeps track of a limited number of digital files perfectly! And we can absolutely count on the truthfulness of the Bitcoin blockchain, because we know how it works, we know how the transactions are propagated, we know how the blocks are made, and it\u2019s all based on math that all can be corroborated. And so there\u2019s this truth that is basic, absolute truth! It\u2019s like a force of nature! It\u2019s built in such a way that it resonates harmonically with the energy around everything. And you can trust it! [1:02:20] Once you recognize the truth that it bears. And you can learn to trust it and use it. And it\u2019s like any other trust that we can find: in engineering, you can test materials, setting up examples, and breaking things to the point that you know how much energy it takes to break something. And then you can engineer a building to not fail, because the loads will never get to the level of what you calculated it would need [for] it to break, and then you put a 100% safety factor just to be careful. So now you\u2019re using truths in engineering to give you something that may or may not work. So for example, let me extrapolate out further: you are looking at a bell curve\u2014engineer calculates a whole bunch of things he knows are absolutely going to always happen, and you go out and you get a set of plans and you start building the building, right? And unbeknownst to you that a whole bunch of people along the way cut a little bit of corners thinking it wasn\u2019t gonna matter. And then in the end, the collective cutting of corners causes something to fail. And no one saw it coming because the engineer designed the building to be perfect and it all should\u2019ve worked! Except that somebody took their own belief or their own opinion, without checking with truth. And they said, Nah, we don\u2019t need this! Because they just believed it! They just thought, for whatever reason, they didn\u2019t check with actual truth. So there\u2019s a lot of this that\u2019s tied together around us in the world, I think. Things like music, things like taste, things that are visual, things that are social like truth or trustworthiness. These things have certain fundamental principles that are unchangeable and it\u2019s us that changes around them. It\u2019s us that try to find harmony with them. And it\u2019s when we find the best harmony with all these different universal first principles that are around us anyway, that we find, not only our own happiness, but we find a way to live in this world and deal with truth and those kinds of important concepts. [1:04:18] I guess that\u2019s the best way to think about it. I\u2019ve said this many times, that the principles don\u2019t care about your knowledge of them, or your attitude towards them. They act anyway. You don\u2019t have to know about them, and if you know about them, you can have a crappy attitude about them, and they don\u2019t give a crap! Principles will act on you! Gravity\u2019s gonna act on you! Engineering forces are gonna act on you! Truth is gonna act on you, whether you like it or not! You wanna lie all day long? Truth is gonna come back to bite you in the ass one day! It\u2019s just how it works! These things are\u2014I don\u2019t know \u2014they\u2019re just the basis of everything that works on this planet. The closer you get to fundamental truths in all these different areas, the easier it\u2019s gonna be to not only navigate this crazy world, but get enjoyment out of this crazy world. And when I found Bitcoin and I started connecting these dots in my own head, about all the things that I\u2019ve had to uncover myself about how things actually work, it just became so strong for me, in terms of why it matters and why I care so much about it \u2014 getting back to why I give a crap to talk about this all day long. This is so important! [1:05:27] I just wanted to back up a second: when I was a kid I took everything apart. I just wanted to know how everything worked. One of the best presents I ever got was a toolbox full of tools when I was like 8 years old. And I could work on my bicycle! And you know, if you try to fix the brakes on your bicycle and you mess that up and you need them and they don\u2019t work, you\u2019re gonna figure out real quick that principles actually matter. Tightening the nut just the right amount is gonna matter! Lining up the pad to the tire just right so touches when you squeeze the brake is gonna matter! Making sure there\u2019s no rust inside the cable housing so that the cable slides smoothly inside \u2014 these are all physics principles. They absolutely matter to the functioning of your bicycle brake! And if one of those things isn\u2019t working right, you may find yourself in position where you\u2019re gonna crash because the brake you thought was gonna work is not working, because some of the principles are broken. So when you\u2019re living in a world where you don\u2019t get a chance to argue this stuff \u2014 you have to align yourself with it? That\u2019s the world I grew up with, literally everything around me had to fit in to this \u2014if I can\u2019t see the logic I\u2019m not going with that! And so, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve resisted stupid government edicts all the time, and stupid rules that are everywhere on the planet. I just can\u2019t relate, they make no sense! You know, victimless crimes that are everywhere! This is just other human beings writing words on paper, deciding that they want other human beings they don\u2019t even know to act in certain ways, and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re gonna take violence upon them, steal their money, just because they don\u2019t like something about them? I just can\u2019t stand any of that! [There\u2019s] no logic in it, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not right! I just push back against all that! [1:07:01] Bitcoin was just the thing that tied it all together for me, literally. Once I realized why money\u2019s important, how it works, how everything stems from money\u2014literally everything stems from money \u2014 that we get to value [things] in society and it all comes because of the use of money. Once I saw that and once I saw how important Bitcoin was, it allowed all these other things I\u2019ve known intuitively to become connected. It\u2019s allowed me to be able to have this conversation with you. To know and feel deep down \u2014 I\u2019ve studied some of it as well \u2014 to know that these things are real. They\u2019re true! They\u2019re there, and we don\u2019t get to choose about them, we just get to act with them! I wish I could remember the quote exactly, one of my favorite books is the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, because it\u2019s based on principles. And in the book he tells a story of a ship captain calling out on the radio, You\u2019re in our lane! You must move out of our lane! There\u2019s a big light out in front of them and they\u2019re worried they\u2019re gonna crash into another ship. And so the radio comes back, No! You get out of our lane! And the captain says, You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to! I\u2019m Captain So and So of Such and Such Big Important ship, and you need to move right now or we\u2019re going to hit you! And the voices comes over the loudspeaker, I don\u2019t care who you are! This is the lighthouse! You better move or you\u2019re gonna crash! Right? So principles don\u2019t give a crap! [1:08:22] They act on us whether we know about them, or whatever the attitude of them is. So principles are like lighthouses \u2014 we need to bend ourselves to them! They do not get out of our way!"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/MRgK6ROtaMo", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #17 \u2014 Surfer Jim: The Bitcoin Radical", "text": "Surfer Jim: Ooh! Surfing! You know, surfing, because it\u2019s given me an identity and it\u2019s allowed me to travel around the world and \u2014 just the experience of going surfing is absolutely amazing! I don\u2019t know how else to describe it other than to be literally in unison with nature for several seconds at a time when you\u2019re riding a wave. The unison you feel \u2014 the idea that the ocean is doing what it\u2019s gonna do and you\u2019re trying to sink up with it \u2014 it\u2019s not only really, really hard, but it\u2019s really fulfilling when you get to do it, and when you get good at it! So it\u2019s given me kind of a purpose in life. Bitcoin\u2019s been huge, obviously, but I think Bitcoin just, like, enhances my surfing now. It just makes my surfing even better I guess! It\u2019s given me so much! The other thing, I\u2019m just gonna divert here for a quick second, but, learning about truth, and learning about Bitcoin, I was very fortunate to get invited to a steak dinner with Saifedean and Pierre Rochard in New York City, where I was already in the process of trying to improve my health, and then I got completely red-pilled by Saifedean about, You can only eat steak! And like, Meat is the most important food! You shouldn\u2019t eat anything else! I\u2019m like, Woah! This guy\u2019s a little extreme, but okay! He wrote a really good book, so, maybe I should consider what he\u2019s talking about! But as I said I was already on a quest to get healthy here, and I learned that a lot of the food I used to eat was really bad for me. And it worked! I switched around, I eat mostly meat at this point, and my health has dramatically improved, and it\u2019s improved my surfing! So all these things are so tied together! When you find truth in one thing, all of a sudden you stumble along on some truths somewhere else. I have to say, my enthusiasm for my surfing has increased because my health has increased because I\u2019ve found a little more truth in dietary information because I\u2019ve found a little more truth in Bitcoin! [1:10:40] It\u2019s amazing how it ripples through your life. Surfing is definitely a little more important but, boy, Bitcoin has had a huge impact. It\u2019s been almost 4 years it\u2019s been in my life, so. Ooh, it\u2019s getting close! Maybe in another 20 years I might have to say Bitcoin has been more impactful!"}

That\u2019s a tough one, there\u2019s so many and they\u2019re all unique. I have to say Endless Summer 2 was really good, because it built on the first Endless Summer, but it used a little more modern take. But then there\u2019s another one called Riding Giants which, when I saw it was unbelievable. Because riding super big waves is really amazing. I\u2019ve been out in some very big surf, but I would never try to tackle some of the waves that some of these guys ride, so that was impressive. I saw it in a movie theater on a big screen so that was really awesome. I might\u2019ve even seen that in an IMAX theater, so that was pretty good. But there\u2019s a lot of little cult ones. I went to a place in Mexico many times, over and over again, because it\u2019s such a great surf spot. It\u2019s called Puerto Escondido. And when I went there \u2014 it was probably in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when I was going there a lot \u2014 there was a guy that planted himself there all season and he would shoot videos. And he put out a couple, they\u2019re called Puerto Underground by a guy named Dave Ogle. And some of the footage he\u2019s got is absolutely phenomenal! I was fortunate enough that he filmed me on enough of my waves, while he was out there making his surf videos, and he made me my own personal surf video that I got on VHS tape, I gotta make it digital one day. But I got me surfing this one spot and he put music to it, it\u2019s my own little professional video. But he made some really insane videos of this place, Puerto Escondido. I\u2019d have to say they\u2019re up high on my list of good videos."}

I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity. I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this when you first offered this to me. And so I did get out a lot of what I wanted to say already and I really appreciate not only the opportunity, but the questions you asked me and the way you posed them allowed me to run with it, so to speak. If anybody does want to find me they can find me on Twitter @surferjimw. That\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019d never done social media until I started learning about Bitcoin. I was told, Well, if you wanna learn about Bitcoin you better follow some people on Twitter! And I hit myself on the forehead and said, Ah! I gotta learn Twitter? What is that crap! Social media? I don\u2019t want to do that! I never did Facebook. But I did it! Twitter was worth it! Twitter is a very fascinating platform, there\u2019s a lot of smart people on there, and I spew out enough stuff, some of it might be worthwhile, so if you want to hear what I have to say, I\u2019m on Twitter. My last shill is gonna have to be for the Long Island Surf Bar. So a good friend of mine, he went down to Typhoon Lagoon in Disneyworld in Florida, where you can rent the wave pool and go surfing in it. He did that, and then he was just so enamored by the whole thing, he came back and said to me, Jim, we gotta build a surf bar on Long Island! And I said, Well, Chris, good luck! I can\u2019t build a surf bar! I mean, I\u2019ll help you if you want to try and build one. And he wanted to! And so we\u2019ve been spending about the last five or six years \u2014 he, myself, and his son, trying to figure out if we could build a surf bar. And him and his son \u2014 I give his son a ton of credit, he was just a teenager when we started the process, but he has taken the bull by the horns and he has run with it. This kid knows anything and everything about this project, and over the past five years we built the website, we built the mailing list, we did a lot of market research. And we\u2019re gonna build the first wave pool on Long Island! We have cutting edge technology that enhances all of the technology that\u2019s out there. We have some proprietary stuff. I built a test tank. I was asked to build, based on the specifications given to me by the pool designer. So we run little mini waves in our little test tank. Chris went out and bought land \u2014 we got three acres of land to build this wave pool on. We have site-plan approval from the town of Brookhaven, where it\u2019s going to be located. So they\u2019ve already given us permission to build the surf bar. And we are now in the process of getting the permits to build the park, so they say, You can build it but now you\u2019ve gotta show us how you\u2019re gonna build it. So we\u2019ve gotta meet water filtration standards and all the crazy safety standards for a public pool, but we are gonna build a state of the art wave pool on the land, the tag-line is, Always 7 ft. and hollow. So we want a wave that you can stand up inside the tube, every single wave, over and over if you want. And we believe we can make that because the tests in our tank show us that we\u2019re meeting all our benchmarks that we need to meet. So we\u2019re hoping by about a year from now this thing\u2019s gonna be open. Oh! And let me tell you another thing: we\u2019re gonna make our own electricity. This ties into Bitcoin so this is a good ending for this whole podcast. We are gonna make our own electricity. We ran the numbers on what is it gonna take to make this thing possible. We figured out, if we bring natural gas into the site and run our own natural gas generators, we can make all our own electricity! We also figured out that all this equipment that\u2019s gonna make the waves and generate the electricity is all gonna produce heat, so we\u2019re gonna take the heat and we\u2019re gonna stick it in the water, and we\u2019re gonna have warm water year-round. This is gonna be an outdoor pool but in the winter it will still be warm. And then I got to thinking, after listening to Marty Bent talk about Great American Mining and what they\u2019re doing with flared natural gas in the oil fields, I thought to myself, You know, the generators are gonna run constantly, but the load on the generators is gonna go up and down constantly. And I see no reason why we can\u2019t turn on and off Bitcoin miners and take advantage of the excess electricity that would just get dumped back into the grid or sent back into the ground if it isn\u2019t used. So I pretty much have the guys convinced, my partners here, that we might be setting up some Bitcoin miners and we\u2019ll be making sats and waves on the Long Island Wave Pool. First of its kind! I would like to see that play out, but even if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll make a really great wave pool and I may spend the next 10 years building ten more of them with my friend\u2019s son, who has a plan to build ten in the next 10 years. So I\u2019ve got that going for me along with Bitcoin, so I\u2019m about as stoked and optimistic as anybody could be in this space, that\u2019s for sure! That\u2019s my story!"}

Simon Dixon here, and welcome to the fifth episode of Bitcoin HARDTalk where we give hard talk about the hardest form of money. I wanted to do an episode on all the reasons why you should not buy Bitcoin\u2014I like to give a balanced view, not just the bull case. I know it\u2019s very easy to get caught in the bull case. But what can go wrong with Bitcoin? And there\u2019s certain things that have come up over the years, some genuine objections, some which are just misguided, and some that have just been proven wrong, just by experimentation and experience over time. And so in this episode, what I wanted to do is cover some of the different political scenarios, and also cover the technical reactions as a result of some of these common objections to why Bitcoin might fail. In order to do that\u2014because I\u2019ve got different ideas and different theories \u2014 I wanted to bring somebody in that could answer some of the more technical questions. You will know that I am a finance guy that got pushed into technology, and found technology. But I wanted to get a technical guy that\u2019s also good at thinking about some of the political and technical. And really when that came up, there was only one person that I had in mind, and that\u2019s really my go-to expert whenever I want to learn something technical and have somebody that can actually explain really technical and complex subjects in a real easy and understandable way, with a bit of philosophy and also a bit of politics injected in. And to me there\u2019s only one guy that came to mind, and that\u2019s Andreas Antonopoulos. Andreas is the author of Mastering Bitcoin, Mastering Ethereum, and The Internet of Money. He\u2019s a technical guy but he\u2019s also very proficient in both the philosophy, the politics, and the technical side of Bitcoin. He\u2019s been around since 2012, so he\u2019s seen all these different things play out over the years. And really, Andreas has often been the first person that people come across, certainly in the earlier days when they discover Bitcoin. The reason for that is because he has a real gift as an educator to actually articulate different schools of thought, and educate people, and is responsible for more people getting into Bitcoin than many people I know. So the first thing you probably think is, This is gonna be Bitcoin HARDTalk, so why do you have somebody that\u2019s not gonna give hard objections to Bitcoin? Well, we really try to tackle some of these issues, so we covered all of the common objections: whether it be quantum computing, whether it be making Bitcoin illegal, whether it could be mining centralization, and we covered all of the common things that would really stop someone from getting into Bitcoin and play out different scenarios. I\u2019ll cover more of the political/financial side and Andreas will jump in with the technical, and then we\u2019ll come up with a general philosophy. And we end the recording with what we consider to be the biggest risks to Bitcoin. Now I do want to warn you: sometimes Andreas can get pretty technical, but I challenge you to persist through that, because at the end, we cover all of these, and we bring it all together into simple-to-understand, different scenarios that everyday people may not be so technically gifted at as Andreas can understand. So just push through the technical jargon, and we\u2019ll see you on the other side. Okay, so I\u2019m really excited to be doing this. Andreas and myself have crossed paths in many different environments across the years. And finally we get to create some content together. And I was thinking to myself, what is the best thing that Andreas and myself could do? And I think with the current stage at the moment, there\u2019s lots of new people, we\u2019re in a new adoption cycle where lots of new people are coming in. And throughout the years, we\u2019ve pretty much seen every single reason, or every single objection that one could give, to not wanting to be involved in Bitcoin, or the same things that people have. And what I wanted to do in this is cover some of those objections. And I want to do it from the perspective of not just always thinking of the bullish case for why people should be involved in Bitcoin and what can happen, but also just tackle some of the genuine risks and what are real risks, what are fake risks. And so in doing that, I thought Andreas is probably the person that I would go to, if I ever wanted some of the technical perspective, not just simply because he knows the technology, but because he can also communicate and help people understand. And I think Andreas, you like to think of yourself as an educator, and I think you\u2019ve done a great job educating in this space."}

I think of myself as the greeter \u2014 the Bitcoin greeter that meets you when you come in, I\u2019m like, Hello, folks! Welcome to Bitcoin! How can I help you find something today? The funny thing is that the journey you described, which is: overcoming all of these risks and objections, it\u2019s not something that only newbies go through. I think it\u2019s something everyone in Bitcoin goes through. So there\u2019s no such thing as someone who came into Bitcoin fully convinced, and wasn\u2019t a skeptic. And that shouldn\u2019t be the case. We should all be skeptics, right? At first. Because, what we\u2019re talking about is something that defies many of our expectations and beliefs \u2014 even Satoshi Nakamoto was a skeptic! They didn\u2019t come in and say, This is going to work! They came in and said, Well, this might work, and if it did work, here\u2019s how it might play out. [06:46] And they didn\u2019t make all of those predictions correctly. Every single person after that came in with, I have a lot of questions about how this could go wrong! And the process of becoming persuaded about the robustness of this system comes from two-parts experience: the (1) first one is, as you\u2019re thinking and understanding more and more of this system, these little fears pop up, these little risks, and you\u2019re like, Huh, I wonder if, if this happened, could that be the Achilles heel? What\u2019s the catch here? And you come up with these risks. And so gradually overcoming those and understanding, Oh, well, no, that wouldn\u2019t actually work. Bitcoin would survive that. So one perspective is analytical\u2014theoretical: I don\u2019t think that would work because here\u2019s why the technology would adapt. The second part\u2014which is even more interesting \u2014 that I\u2019ve experienced, is: actually seeing these things play out. Like, what happens if the one and only exchange loses everything two years in? That actually happened! And, I was like, We probably won\u2019t survive this. And then we did. And that taught me something about the robustness. So I think that\u2019s a great basis for us to help people go on that skeptic journey, because it\u2019s a healthy perspective to have. Talk about some of the theoretical attacks but also talk about some of the experiences we\u2019ve had that have persuaded us that this isn\u2019t just theory. That, in practice, we\u2019ve seen some some of these things play out."}

Okay, well since you brought that one up, maybe for some historical context, how did you feel when there\u2019s this one exchange that was pretty much the only place where, I mean \u2014 some people say that it was about 70% of the whole Bitcoin supply was being traded on Mt. Gox \u2014 and then it turned out that the whole thing is just shut down, withdrawals, and it\u2019s all over. Can you remember where you were and how you felt when that actually happened?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Oh absolutely I can. So, first of all, my skepticism of Mt. Gox\u2014which was a website that was originally bought as a Magic: The Gathering online exchange, and then converted and pivoted to being a Bitcoin exchange, and was the only Bitcoin exchange. My journey of skepticism began long before Mt. Gox failed. Mt. Gox had had a lot of growing pains, and every time the volume would go up, the lag of trading would shoot through the roof, which would cause a lot of people a lot of tears, right? If you put in an order at a specific price, and then it takes 20 minutes to fill that order, but in the meantime the price has dropped significantly, and you end up losing money\u2014that hurts. So I remember that I had been railing against this site and saying, Listen, this isn\u2019t safe! Do not store your money here! This was the beginning of me beginning to say things like, Not your keys, not your coins. I had started saying that back then, and telling people why they shouldn\u2019t leave money on an exchange. But, even though I was saying that, there\u2019s two aspects: there\u2019s a lot of people who had money on the exchange who were basically treating it as a vault, as a wallet, not an exchange. But there were also all of the exchange functions. If you wanted to convert USD or any other currency into Bitcoin or back, that was pretty much the only service. This was before any others existed. I remember getting the call \u2014 this was before it became public \u2014 I got the call from some people who were running one of the biggest wallets in the space, who I was working with at the time. And I was in a diner meeting with some family friends for brunch in San Francisco. And I got the call, and I said, Excuse me one second, I gotta take this call\u2014it seems urgent. I took the call and they said, Um, we just heard\u2014it\u2019s probably going to go public in the next hour or so \u2014 Mt. Gox is bankrupt. The money\u2019s all gone. And it\u2019s gonna shut down. And I remember feeling, like, Oof. That\u2019s it \u2014 we\u2019re done! You know, by that point, I\u2019d put a year and a half of my life into this, all of my savings, I\u2019m in debt, I don\u2019t have a job, I haven\u2019t yet been paid to do anything in the Bitcoin space. And it was the first time that I actually felt, Oh! Fuu\u2014 this could be it. [11:54] And really, because I\u2019d seen that happen before with Liberty Dollar, and E-Gold, and bunch of other, more centralized digital currencies before that. So it was this sinking feeling, and I cried that day. I was very upset, I was like, I\u2019ve basically lost everything. I had no money on Mt. Gox, but I felt \u2014 this will kill Bitcoin. This could kill Bitcoin. And it didn\u2019t. And that really, really changed my perspective on how robust this system is."}

I do remember what a time it was. Prior to this, it\u2019s easy for people to come along now, and I guess a lot of people think they\u2019ve missed the boat. But, you know, Bitcoin shouldn\u2019t have succeeded. It was very, very unlikely to succeed. And every objection that people had back then were really real objections that were very hard to counter at the time. But yeah, everybody losing their money certainly felt like, Okay, this is the end."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Yes. Obviously a lot of people who used the exchange as a wallet lost their money. I think it was, at the time, something like three-quarters of a billion dollars. At a time when that was a very significant percentage of the total Bitcoin out there. One of the interesting things is, What can we extrapolate from that? Today a lot of people will say \u2014 and I hear this criticism all the time \u2014 that, if governments wanted to end Bitcoin, all they have to do is shut down the on-ramps and off-ramps. Make it very difficult to exchange, and that would kill Bitcoin. And part of my prior experience helps me with this, because I remember back with what happened with Mt. Gox: for a period of time, not only did we not have any exchanges, but we also lost a significant amount of Bitcoin that ended up being stolen. And it didn\u2019t kill Bitcoin then \u2014 when a single exchange was enough to effectively shut down all official channels for converting fiat to Bitcoin. And leaving only peer to peer mechanisms \u2014 exchanging cash, among others. Now, not only would you have to do that in a massive, global coordinated effort by world governments \u2014 because if you leave any of those doors open, everything just flows through there \u2014 now we also have stablecoins which allow us to deal with the other aspect which was problematic then, which is wire transfers of dollars. So we can flow enormous volume through these exchanges. And, even then it wouldn\u2019t work. People would revert to P2P. Yeah, it would stop the institutional investors, it would slow down our progress, it would hurt the price temporarily. But, if you realize, at that moment, that this won\u2019t actually kill it, you get two results: the first one is, any price decline you see, if you know it\u2019s not gonna kill, you start thinking, Well, I mean, this might be an opportunity. We might be seeing something that is temporary, but doesn\u2019t change the long term valuation. In which case, you act on that. But the other thing is, you realize that, that result and that mentality changes the calculation upfront, which is: in order for this to work you\u2019d have to have concerted, massive coordination between world governments. But, if they knew that, in the end, there was a significant possibility that this wouldn\u2019t actually kill Bitcoin, and if they knew that trying but failing to kill it, ends up backfiring \u2014 because it feeds the narrative of This thing can survive even concerted action by national governments at a massive scale \u2014 well then they don\u2019t even try, because that\u2019s too dangerous to try. As they say, If you\u2019re gonna take a shot at the King, make sure you don\u2019t miss. [16:47] And this is exactly the case: every attempt to kill Bitcoin that fails, ends up inadvertently strengthening the narrative that it is not possible to kill this thing. So therefore, there\u2019s this strategic game that gets play at a meta-level, which is: it\u2019s actually better not to try direct attacks like that, because if they fail, they\u2019re worse than not trying at all."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Simon Dixon: Well I remember, I was in Shanghai on a boat at a Bitcoin conference with lots of people from the Bitcoin community in this one boat, and the announcement came through that some of the CEOs of the exchanges in China were arrested, and they announced that there was a ban on Bitcoin exchanges in China. And suddenly, we were on this boat with lots of people that were at the conference, and we heard these sirens happening, and we thought that everyone was coming, that this boat was gonna be pulled aside and we were all going to disappear in a prison in China. But then the boat just went straight past and everything carried. But the price corrected, and it had a couple of thousand points that came off the price at that stage. But then that went into a raging bull market and we had these industries\u2014and what I\u2019ve seen is that every time, firstly \u2014 you talked about it \u2014 it has to be coordinated, because when one country does it, we\u2019ve seen what happens. And the two trends that I saw as a result of that were (1) firstly, all of the volume went to Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. And Japan\u2014who were the host of the exchange we talked about earlier \u2014 Mt. Gox, and another big one that got hacked, Coincheck, had been working a lot on their regulations of crypto-exchanges. And so, China\u2014they allowed the mining industry to continue, but they banned the exchanges. Now the interesting thing about that is, if I were a government, and I was trying to collect lots of data, mining is: you put some fiat money in, you buy some machines and Bitcoins come out and they can go anywhere. But with exchanges, you gotta do all the Know Your Customer and you\u2019ve gotta collect all the data. So what happened is that all of the data went to South Korean exchanges, Japanese exchanges, and Singapore exchanges. And China lost the data collection that they might have wanted. As we know, it\u2019s a big agenda of governments to collect all of that data. The (2) second thing that happened\u2014so, it just goes to another country, so then you have to have the coordinated effort\u2014but the second thing is, you start to get the real innovation coming through, and that was when, it was after that, that this phrase \u201cDEX\u201d came around, decentralized exchange. Because, everyone starts figuring out, Well, how do you do this in the peer to peer? You know, everyone was doing this peer to peer, for example, if you had to go exchange cash, but then through technology, people started figuring out, How can we do that online? And the innovation just gets further and further and further. So if you start to see\u2014right now, the big thing is DeFi \u2014 if there is a regulatory crackdown, which I\u2019m sure there will be, then people start to push the innovation further, and then other countries see the opportunities and start putting robust regulations that are centralized. So, to me it drives the centralized business somewhere else, and the drives the decentralized innovation as a result, and it just continues."}

Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos [20:43]: Yeah, to me I think what we have to think about is that when you have a decentralized system like this, that is truly global, there is an asymmetry of action. In order for centralized institutions \u2014 regulators, governments, etc. \u2014 to crack down or put a halt or slow down this system, they have to coordinate. And their coordination has to be near-perfect. I use another example about decentralization, the asymmetry of centralized versus decentralized systems, which is this: imagine your favorite super-band is having a concert at a stadium, and it\u2019s a wonderful concert, everyone wants to be there, the ticket is $1000, and the stadium has 100 gates where you can enter, and 99 of those gates have a ticket-checking station, and check for tickets, and one of those gates is wide open and anyone can walk in. Simon, what is the ticket price for that concert?"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: It\u2019s free! It\u2019s free, because if you have one gate that\u2019s free, everybody goes through that gate! I mean there still might be some people who go through the other gates because they\u2019ve already paid for the ticket, maybe for convenience because it\u2019s closer to the parking lot, but just like when you have these outdoor concerts and someone knocks one of the fences down and then you see a whole group of band fans going, Waaagh!, running through the fences through the fields, being chased by one or two elderly security guards in yellow vests, completely failing to stop the crowd. This is the asymmetry of centralized versus decentralized: in order to control a system like that, that operates on a centralized basis, you have to 100% block all the exits. Otherwise, if you let one exit\u2014and the switching costs between gates are zero \u2014 the bottom line is that you\u2019ve failed. So a 1% failure in control, is entirely equivalent to a 100% failure in control. So, you\u2019ve got centralized systems and centralized governments that have to coordinate perfectly, with no one stepping out of the game. And then you have a decentralized system that is reacting to these decisions. And the decentralized system doesn\u2019t have to succeed everywhere, it only has to succeed in one place, because this is virtual \u2014 because there is no switching cost \u2014 you just redirect all of the flows through that one place. [23:41] And you may lose some volume at first, but very quickly you\u2019re then going to focus the innovation on optimizing that path, and there\u2019s a very big monetary reward for those who optimize it. It\u2019s a bit like trying to build a dam and you\u2019ve got the world\u2019s best engineers and I\u2019m one dude with a little drill. You know? Great dam you\u2019ve got there! But I\u2019ve got a hammer drill, so let\u2019s see who wins? I don\u2019t need to make the whole dam fall down. I only need to make a hole this big. That\u2019s it! The water will do the rest. The water will take that tiny hole, and it will optimize its egress by making it wider and wider and wider until the dam is gone. So, money works that way! If you have a hole this big in the international system of financial controls and surveillance, which is exactly what Bitcoin is \u2014 it\u2019s the pinprick \u2014 the small trickle that gets through actually funds the development and the innovation and the technology and the standing up of infrastructure to widen that hole. If you\u2019ve got a country like Venezuela that has currency controls, and where the premium for Bitcoin is 30% above price, then whoever is able to send a trickle of Bitcoin into Venezuela and exchange it earns a 30% premium to use to expand their operations as fast as they can! And so that just makes the hole bigger! And this keeps repeating at every level. [25:26] So, decentralized versus centralized systems: the centralizers have to get everything right, the decentralized system only has to make a pinprick. That pinprick will actually self-fund its widening and the innovation, and the end result will be that you just break through the dam completely. And this has happened again and again and again with Bitcoin."}

So, let\u2019s look at the coordinated effort scenario. I can imagine a world, especially where we are today, where IMF calls out for a Bretton Woods II\u2014 already done. They sit down in a meeting, and it turns out that the whole world has complete ruined their fiscal and monetary policy \u2014 done. And they have to all sit around in a room, and they all coordinate a Facebook-style Libra monetary system using central bank digital currencies, and they decide on a global scale that they\u2019re all gonna coordinate and implement some new global monetary system that\u2019s backed by a basket of all these different currencies. And then simultaneously they all agree that in order to opt in to this system, they all need to make Bitcoin illegal for use and purchase in their country. I think the only example we ever got of something like that was when the United States tried to make gold illegal so they could prevent hoarding, but we\u2019ve never seen it on a global, coordinated scale. So while that is one of the risks that could happen, do you think Bitcoin could survive such a coordinated, centralized monetary system and do it with a kind of [inaudible]?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos [27:24]: It would absolutely survive. It would stop thriving \u2014 temporarily. And the reason for that is because, right now, a lot of the volume in Bitcoin is driven by those who can use other monetary systems, have access to the global economy, and choose to, voluntarily, use Bitcoin as a hedge, as a speculative instrument, as a placing, as a way to invest some future protocol. I mean, a lot of those people would obviously be discouraged by such regulations. It all comes down to where you think the primary economic value of the world economy lies. Does it lie in the fiat-denominated spreadsheets of investors and speculators operating in the markets? Are the markets the economy? The regulated, equity global markets, the currency markets? Is that the world economy? Or is the world economy a million papaya and banana stands on the sides of the roads, or taco trucks? Is the world economy the productive output of 7.5 billion humans trying to improve their own lot? I certainly believe it\u2019s the latter. Which then means that, what exactly does that 7.5 billion mass of humanity have to lose, if the issue here is: I can either make a living, or follow the law. I either follow the law, and starve. Or break the law, and survive. Well, we know exactly how that equation works out, because we see it today in the global patterns of adoption of Bitcoin. In the adoption across the global south, where it is being used as a tool of survival. And for that population, if you had this global coordination, that would fail. So that\u2019s one aspect. But the other aspect is this: Great, so the IMF comes out and does this and they do this whole global coordination thing, and they try to shut down Bitcoin. Well, here\u2019s the thing: this is a bit like OPEC. This is a bit like cartel activity. And cartel activities work best when the market is very small, when the number of parties that have to coordinate is very small, and when the upside is very high. But what we\u2019re talking about here is coordinating between a hundred different governments around the world in a very international system on something like money that is broadly used. Now, to me that\u2019s impossible. Because, any country that breaks ranks with the cartel, gains enormously through arbitrage. By saying, You know, that\u2019s cute what you\u2019re trying to do, but we think that if we actually go our own way and we enable on-ramps and off-ramps into and out of Bitcoin, in the first round, we\u2019re going to get a lot of the people who are abandoning Bitcoin to come to us. And in the second round, we\u2019re going to actually be able to grow substantially by being outside the system, because we\u2019re outside the system already. China would do that, in my opinion. Almost immediately! They have no strategic advantage to signing on to a global system that is already dominated by the US and used for sanctions and geopolitical control, and hand them a new system that\u2019s that, minus any alternatives, competition, exits, or safety valves. That\u2019s strategic suicide. And of course for the very same reasons, Russia wouldn\u2019t sign on to this. And what you end up doing is you have exactly the kind of split that we saw during the Cold War. You end up with a currency Cold War. And then you have a situation where there are basically two spheres of influence: there\u2019s the First World \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know if you know this but the term Third World simply meant the unaligned nations \u2014 First World was the Western countries on the Cold War, Second World was the Eastern countries that were involved in the Cold War, and Third World, was just anyone who wasn\u2019t with either the Soviets or the Americans. It was about splitting the world into two spheres of influence. So if you end up doing that with currencies again, where you have the post-Bretton Woods international money system dominated by Western nations, and then you have the outsiders saying No!, dominated by China and Russia, which would end up taking most of Africa with them, a good chunk of South America, all of Southeast Asia, you then end up with two completely different spheres of the economy. Now let\u2019s think about this: they would not be allowed to talk to each other, right? Because they\u2019re both closed systems. So there\u2019d be only one way to move value from one to the other, which would be a permissionless system. [33:16] In that case, Bitcoin actually becomes the rails for connecting the two spheres. So if you want to move money from the Sino-Soviet region of money to the Anglo region of money, the only rail that connects the two is Bitcoin. I mean, that, in my opinion, not only fails spectacularly but then it actually elevates Bitcoin to world reserve currency very very quickly \u2014 through neutrality. Neutrality becomes its leading factor. Both sides see that. If I have to choose between a system that\u2019s controlled by this set of countries that are not allied with me, or that set of countries that are not allied with me, how about I just choose a system that\u2019s not controlled by any country, so it doesn\u2019t matter if they are allied with me or not. Neutrality then becomes the winner, by default."}

Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Simon Dixon: Okay, let\u2019s move to another common objection. Let\u2019s look at mining. So firstly, let\u2019s not assume everyone knows what mining is. So, Bitcoin is backed by proof of work, and we\u2019re about to get a large-scale experiment of one of the significant cryptocurrencies \u2014 Ethereum \u2014 switching from proof of work to proof of stake, so we actually get to see two cryptocurrencies that have adoption for their own use-cases, and we get to actually see in real time the infinite expectations of what happens with proof of work and proof of stake, assuming these two systems survive. But one of the big objections is the whole inefficiency of proof of work, and how bad it is for the environment, and how, if Bitcoin becomes as significant as it could be, it will consume so much electricity that it becomes this just completely clunky, inefficient network. What would you say about the proof of work and\u2014actually maybe just start with helping people understand the difference between proof of work, proof of stake and where you think these go?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos [36:18]: Yeah. Proof of work is about connecting currency to the ultimate form of value, which is energy. Everything we do on this planet is underwritten by energy. The food we eat is solar energy captured by photosynthesizing organisms, and then converted up a food chain into other forms of food. The heating in our homes, the ability to transport things around the planet, everything is energy. So in most currencies, the use of energy is mediated between the currency and the underlying energy by institutions that essentially change the exchange rate between energy and currency. So if you think about it, we just have a bigger chain for energy consumption: the US dollar is backed by energy, but instead of being backed directly by energy through proof of work, which is an efficient way of backing it by energy, you do it indirectly by energy. So you burn 100 million barrels of oil in order to wage war on lots of countries to control their oil reserves. You have all of the secondary effects, all of which ultimately consume a lot of energy, in fact in much more polluting ways, to do non-productive functions that act as a backing of the currency. [37:56] And, you know, if you call Bitcoin proof of work, I would call the US dollar proof of war. And that is the most polluting form of energy, and the least beneficial form of energy use we have on the planet. The military is the worst polluter in the country, and by extension in the world. So the idea that Bitcoin is inefficient misses the point, which is that proof of work is a mechanism for providing security in order to make the currency work, that does not have all of the intermediate forms of energy consumption in between the energy and the providing security. And so it\u2019s a much more direct way of providing security for the currency, and unlike traditional currencies, where you don\u2019t get to choose where the energy will be consumed or how it will be produced, Bitcoin actually gravitates to places where energy is overproduced and under-consumed, where you have for most production systems that are not connected to distribution grids. Where you have developing nations that are moving fast and building new capacity without being able to distribute it. Where you have newly launched alternative energy systems: wind, solar, hydro, etc. That again, have overcapacity in production and do not yet have sufficient demand. And in all of those places, Bitcoin gravitates and provides a subsidy that reduces the unit cost of electric production for those systems of energy. So essentially, it\u2019s a subsidy system for solar, wind, hydro, and alternative energy, in places where that development is needed the most. And we\u2019ve seen that in practice. This is not just a speculative thing. We\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s exactly how Bitcoin mining gravitates towards those sources of energy. Now, proof of work is one mechanism of doing it, proof of stake is a different mechanism of doing it, and they have different pros and cons. They\u2019re not exactly substitute mechanisms. They\u2019re not equivalent. What you can do with proof of work is not the same as what you can do with proof of stake. [40:32] Proof of work actually provides you with historical immutability, the ability to cement the past in a way that it cannot be changed, which is incredibly important for a very robust currency. Proof of work also gives you something else, which is that it allows you to bootstrap a currency without a prior distribution mechanism. You see, the thing is, with proof of stake, and let me explain proof of stake briefly \u2014 proof of stake is where, instead of using energy to back the currency, you use the currency by putting down a bond that you will do the security verification for every new transaction that happens. And if you fulfill your promise and do the security correctly, you get a slight reward \u2014 you earn some interest essentially. It\u2019s a bit like using a certificate of deposit or investing in a bond and generation some yield as you maintain the security of the system through audits. So you\u2019re putting down an auditing bond, you\u2019re then auditing the system, and if you audit it successfully according to everybody else\u2019s expectation, then you earn a bit of reward. If you audit it incorrectly, then you lose some of your principal. Here\u2019s the thing: in order to do proof of stake, you need to have the currency that is going to be used to stake already distributed. And of course, in order to do proof of stake fairly\u2014where you don\u2019t have one person or group of people seize control from the very beginning \u2014 you have to have a fairly broad distribution of the currency before you start proof of stake. Well that creates a bit of a chicken and egg problem. You can\u2019t bootstrap a proof of stake system ab initio. You can\u2019t have a virgin birth of a proof of stake system, because, essentially, all of the control is in one group. [42:28] Which is why many proof of stake systems actually bootstrap as proof of work. Proof of work allows you to do a virgin birth, like we had with Bitcoin. You bootstrap it, the proof of work uses a mechanism to distribute the currency based on competition of resources. But here\u2019s the interesting thing: once you\u2019ve done that, you can actually switch to proof of stake if you want to! Ironically, the efforts to perfect proof of stake, to improve, to test at bigger and bigger scale, to put under adversarial trial proof of stake systems\u2014in Ethereum \u2014 is actually an enormous safety mechanism for Bitcoin. And Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work and immutability is an enormous safety mechanism for proof of stake systems. Allow me to explain. One of the difficulties a proof of stake system has is it cannot safeguard the immutability of the past. There\u2019s a type of attack against proof of stake systems called a long-range attack, where, essentially what you can do is you can re-write the past beyond a certain depth for zero cost. Because there\u2019s no way to prove that that past is immutable. In a proof of work system, if you\u2019ve used the energy and then you try to recalculate the past, you have to re-expend the same amount of energy, there\u2019s no shortcut, you can\u2019t do it without proving the proof of work. So if you spent gigawatts to get to today, and you wanted to re-write the past, you\u2019d have to spend those gigawatts again to re-write it. And that preserves the past very robustly, because, of course, you only get rewarded once, but you expend the energy twice if you try to re-write the past. In proof of stake you can\u2019t do that, but you could take proof of stake checkpoints and embed them in a proof of work blockchain that gives you the robust protection of the past and therefore safeguards your proof of stake blockchain from long-range attacks. You can use the proof of work blockchain as an oracle that gives you check-pointing. In fact, a number of chains already do that with Bitcoin. But here\u2019s the other way it works: the key scenario that most people are worried about is: the miners get shut down. Somehow, a government coerces all of the miners into shutting down their operations, or seizes their operations, or takes over and forces them to censor transactions, or whatever. And we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot guarantee that 51% of the mining is in honest hands, which is the prerequisite for maintaining a proof of work chain. Well, there are a number of things that can be done at that point. There can be proof of authority overlays, where you basically say, These miners have acted improperly in the past, we\u2019re not going to accept them. We\u2019re going to vet some of the miners and sign their blocks and only accept those. Tricky to do. But here\u2019s a thought of how we could actually fix this in Bitcoin, which would be to switch to proof of stake, perhaps temporarily, perhaps long-term. You take out all the miners, we switch to proof of stake. The funny thing is that, Bitcoin\u2019s already been distributed. So we\u2019ve already solved the virgin birth problem. We already have Bitcoin holders, who have in their best interest to maintain the honesty of the chain, which means that those people staking their Bitcoin would actually protect the system against proof of work attacks. The thing is, you don\u2019t need to implement that solution for it to be an effective counter-measure. Simply the fact that you can means that an attack against miners is ultimately a failed attack. It involves hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of dollars, in infrastructure, if you\u2019re gonna do a 51% attack. Or it involves expending enormous and strategic capital to compromise and coerce the miners in your state, and then ultimately what that results in is someone nuking your strategic Bitcoin infrastructure from under your feet, and kicking you off the position of power that you had, and now just lost. To achieve what, exactly? Nothing! So, the mere existence of a counter-measure acts to prevent this attack. [47:32] This is a bit like Chekhov\u2019s gun: if you see a gun on the mantle-piece in Act I of a play, someone\u2019s gonna get shot in Act III. The presence of that thing signals what comes next. The fact that we have more than one effective consensus algorithm now prevents an attack against consensus algorithms. Does that make sense?"}

So I guess, summarizing that mining centralization argument is a big thing. People always are concerned. Originally, you could fire up a laptop and you could use your computer power to mine Bitcoin. Then it moved to more complex graphic cards, and then it moved to specific machines, and now it\u2019s institutionalized. Firstly, when people say that about 65% of mining happens in China, is that something that actually is true and can be verified? And do you see a scenario where the Chinese government nationalizes all that mining power and Bitcoin becomes Chinacoin?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: So, first of all, there\u2019s no way to actually verify that. People make a gross simplification in most of these arguments. What they say is, 70% of the mining pools are concentrated in China, and then they equate mining pools with mining power, and that\u2019s absolutely not the case. Mining pools are concordia of mining power that concentrate the activity of mining, but they don\u2019t physically exist anywhere. So you can participate with your mining power in any mining pool you want, and most importantly the switching cost of moving from one mining pool to another is zero. So if someone takes over a mining pool and you don\u2019t like how they\u2019re operating, you just switch mining pools, and that\u2019s it! And the mining power drains enormously fast. We\u2019ve seen this happen several times in Bitcoin\u2019s past, where a mining pool has acted suspiciously, or even a rumor has been started that a mining pool might act suspiciously, and the mining power in that pool evaporates overnight, like 95% drop in power overnight. So we know that 70% of the hashrate that presents for mining pools is through mining pools that we see are located in China, because we can identify the location of mining pools. But we don\u2019t know where the actual mining power is. There\u2019s good reason to believe that a chunk of it is in China, probably more than 50%, possibly as big as 70%, but we don\u2019t know that. That\u2019s also not to say that you don\u2019t have pools of mining power that exist in other countries, or that you might not have pools of mining power that can be brought up rather quickly in other countries. The long-term trend has been one of decentralization of mining power. So if you think about it from a numbers perspective, in 2009 there was one miner who had 100% of the hashpower \u2014 Satoshi. And that was the most centralized mining we\u2019ve ever had, but it didn\u2019t matter, because the rule here is that more than 51% must be in honest hands. It doesn\u2019t matter in this case \u2014 one set of hands \u2014 as long as that was honest, it worked. And then it was two, and then it was three, and now we have thousands of miners with machines all around the world. Some estimates in terms of the actual machines is that we\u2019re looking at more than 2 million pieces of hardware devices that are mining. And so from that perspective it\u2019s decentralized, even within China \u2014 I mean China is an enormous country, with a lot of very remote, rural areas where various kinds of deals with local officials generating enormous revenue through the back door are enabled through these mining functions, even if the Chinese government decided, Let\u2019s take down all the miners, this is the conversation I imagine: Hello? Central Party? Yes. Uh, we should do what? Shut down all the miners in our province? Oh. We don\u2019t have any miners in our province. Oh, you found some? We will shut them down immediately. Guys, shut it down for an hour. You know? The problem here is that\u2014yes, okay, China has very very strong controls so that they can expand and extend very strongly all across the country, but we\u2019re talking about money here. And in a centralized system like that where the rule of law is so weak, money has an incredible corrupting influence\u2014the amount of bribes that can be marshaled off of a Bitcoin mine to every layer of official within that area. So, yes it\u2019s possible to shut them all down, but China would want to do that in a very draconian fashion, which of course they might decide to do. But you have to ask Why would they do that? What would they gain exactly? And the truth is that right now, it serves them better to keep that in their back pocket, than basically push the entire industry to the United States and other Western nations, with no hope of seeing it return to their shores ever again, for no reason! It doesn\u2019t really give them any advantage. The final thing is to understand that, taking control of the miners doesn\u2019t allow you to break the rules. If you have control of all of the mining, you still can\u2019t spend Bitcoin that isn\u2019t yours. You still can\u2019t take all of the Bitcoin. You still can\u2019t make transactions pay different people. You can stop the network \u2014 that\u2019s it! And so, in order to do this kind of attack, you have to have one and only one goal, and that is to stop the network. And then it goes into the idea of, if you do that, and you fail to stop the network, what have you proven? You\u2019ve proven that it\u2019s not stoppable. So there\u2019s a very, very big risk in failure there, again as in many attack vectors on Bitcoin. [54:33] That doesn\u2019t mean that China\u2019s not gonna do this \u2014 they might. And this might end up wounding Bitcoin severely and setting it back by years. But I am not of the mind that the development community and the rest of the ecosystem in Bitcoin will simply sit back, let that happen, take no counter-measures whatsoever, and not come back with a torrent of innovation. In fact, quite the opposite. I think that triggers a defense response, which leads me to my final thought on this category of problems, which is: we have to think about this in terms of evolution. This is not a single system battling another single system. This is millions of independent agents in various governments, regulators, and countries, battling millions of individuals with their systems that are dispersed around the world \u2014 software programmers, miners, users, wallets, exchange operators, who have their own interest, right? So if you think about these as two giant populations and you think about them engaging in some kind of battle, then if the predators in that environment create a new attack that finds a vulnerability in the prey, what we know from nature is that that creates an evolutionary response. And what happens when you attack a prey animal is \u2014 depends! Take a look at Australia. You can see there what happens when you have a lot of animals in a very harsh and hostile environment. They become scaly-armored, venomous and poisonous things, so that eventually there are very few cuddly critters in the country, and almost everything can kill you. My theory is this: right now Bitcoin is a gecko. If you start stomping on all the little geckos, you trigger an evolutionary response, and the gecko starts getting bigger, sturdier, scalier, poisonous, angry, and reactive, and what you end up doing is you drive evolution to a Komodo dragon. And if you try to step on a Komodo dragon, it will bite your foot off. So if the governments of the world decide to try an attack like that on Bitcoin, they will drive an evolutionary response, at the protocol level, at the user-interface level, that will make the system stealthy, reactive, evasive, and vicious in response. And that will actually make it unstoppable."}

Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: A quantum computer can take money from an elliptic curve digital signature signed transaction, or address, by reversing a public key into a private key. That is not the same as taking down Bitcoin, however. And that is due to a number of innovations that exist in Bitcoin. So first of all, ellptic curve cryptography that is used in Bitcoin is susceptible to quantum analysis \u2014 cryptanalysis. Meaning that, if you have an elliptic curve public key, you can\u2019t get the private key, because that\u2019s the mathematical equivalent of doing division in the elliptic curve domain which is not possible. You would have to try every possible private key in order to find the one that gives you that public key, also known as a brute force attack in the classical computing environment. Therefore, you can\u2019t take a public key, and find the corresponding private key, or take a digital signature and find the corresponding private key. With a quantum computer, however, you can, as long as you have a quantum computer that can actually do calculations at 256 qubits \u2014 actually, I think it\u2019s only 128 because of the nature of quantum cryptanalysis, but you need a lot of qubits. We\u2019re nowhere near getting that many qubits, but let\u2019s say theoretically you did have a computer like that. Well, you could go on the Bitcoin blockchain and you could find any transaction that has a digital signature or public key in it, and you could find the corresponding private key. Now, here\u2019s the interesting thing: digital signatures of public keys don\u2019t appear in Bitcoin until you spend. When you receive Bitcoin, you receive it to an address which is a double-hash. And the public key and digital signature isn\u2019t shown until you spend. So if you\u2019re not re-using Bitcoin addresses, if every time you do a transaction, you use a new address, and if any time you sign for an address, you spend everything that\u2019s in that address and send the change to a new address, when I\u2019ve shown you my public key and my signature, it\u2019s to a private key that no longer controls money, because the reason you saw it is because I just spend it all from there. Which actually really narrows the focus of such an attack. You\u2019d only be able to do it against keys that been re-used. Quantum computing would also not be very effective for breaking SHA-256. So, that\u2019s a whole different domain of problems \u2014 is doing a preimage attack on a hash algorithm. There\u2019s no indication that you can really accelerate that with a quantum computer. As far as I know there are no good algorithms that can do that. So, money in re-used keys would be vulnerable, but at the same time, that\u2019s not the end of Bitcoin, because we can change the signature algorithm. So we can change to a quantum-resistant signature algorithm, and then it\u2019s resistant to quantum computers. In fact, if quantum computing is widespread, if I can have it in my ThinkPad, then I can use a quantum digital signature that cannot be broken by a quantum computer. If I can sign with a quantum computer then you can\u2019t break it with a quantum computer. So we just upgrade everything to quantum-capable systems. The bottom line is that if you think of Bitcoin as a completely static system, where everybody publishes all of their digital signatures \u2014yes, that\u2019s vulnerable to a quantum computer. But that\u2019s not what Bitcoin is! It\u2019s a system where we don\u2019t publish our signatures until we empty an address, for the most part. And then it\u2019s also a system that can evolve, we can change the signature algorithm. In fact, the very next upgrade in Bitcoin that is being planned right now \u2014 it\u2019s called Taproot \u2014 it\u2019s a collection of changes that is being planned for 2021 introduction into the Bitcoin code base, [that] includes a new signature algorithm called Schnorr signatures. The fact that we can go from elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), to Schnorr signatures and have both of those systems work in parallel, simply demonstrate the fact that we could also have another, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth signature algorithm all co-existing. And we can evolve them over time. So, as long as the system continues to evolve and as long as quantum computers are not capable of doing the amount of qubits that are needed to break our key lengths, we are not only safe, but we can stay ahead of this game."}

All of encryption breaks if you have a quantum computer. Which, interestingly enough, then makes this the most important secret in the world. And, it\u2019s the one that you keep dry until you need it. So let\u2019s say for example that the NSA created a quantum computer with enough qubit capacity to break other governments\u2019 communication secrets. Well, at that point you don\u2019t want to use it. And if you do use it, you want to have the ability to do what\u2019s called parallel construction. Meaning that, you need to have a cover story. So if someone says, Hang on a second. It appears they know that we were going to be in the Red Square at noon exchanging this diplomatic envelope. Did they break our communications? No, probably not. They probably got it by beating up Yuri last week. You need an \u201cother\u201d story that\u2019s more plausible than, They have a quantum computer that can read all of our messages. We actually have a historical parallel to this: between 1941 and 1944, the Allies broke Enigma, the German, the Axis encryption computer machine that was being used by Germans to control submarine fleets, to communicate about air raids, etc. They broke this in England at a place called Bletchley Park under the leadership of Alan Turing, the father of computer science. And then this became the most important secret in the war, because they could now read the German communications \u2014 not immediately, not all of them, but enough and fast enough that they could actually take action. So they had to then construct a complete intelligence system that ensured that for every lead that they followed, they had a cover story that gave a better explanation than, Enigma is broken, so that the Germans wouldn\u2019t stop using the Enigma machine. And in fact there\u2019s a specific example in the war when the Allies found out that Coventry was about to be bombed with one of the biggest raids in the war, and they had the choice between preventing possibly tens of thousands of deaths in the city of Coventry, and revealing \u2014 and they didn\u2019t have a good cover story. And so they decided to let the Germans bomb Coventry and not warn anyone. So, Bitcoin is the attack that doesn\u2019t have a good cover story. You start seeing coins from years ago moving that nobody thinks anyone can break the keys \u2014 the idea starts growing in your mind that maybe someone out there has a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA. Which then creates a worldwide scramble to migrate away from quantum vulnerable encryption systems, and it complete de-fangs that very important intelligence tool. So if someone had such a tool or is able to build such a tool, more likely, over the next 15 years, they would be very smart not to use it on Bitcoin, and instead to keep it, and hold it, and to pretend that such a thing doesn\u2019t exist, and to use it only under dire circumstances."}

And we\u2019ve seen claims that certain developers from within an organization like Blockstream \u2014 when they have more influence over the Bitcoin code, and that you could have a corporate takeover. How do we protect, and what\u2019s the risk of a few key developers making some malicious attacks or being compromised or being ransomed in order to do something?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Well, the first and biggest defense is that this system is an open source system, which means that anyone can and thousands of people do, inspect all of the code changes that go into Bitcoin. I read GitHub blogs. I follow \u2014 not all \u2014 but many of the conversations that are happening on the developer mailing list, in the developer IRC, and in the GitHub pull requests, which are the requests for changes that are happening and publicly discussed. And you can read the code and see what exactly is being changed, how, and why? There is a very, very small possibility that someone could sneak a code change in there that has an unintended side effect that is not immediately obvious. But again, this is a decentralized system, so you change the code of Bitcoin Core \u2014 does that change the security of wallets that don\u2019t depend on Bitcoin Core? Nope! So there is no central piece of code that is used everywhere in Bitcoin, other than the mining functions. The core consensus algorithms which are very, very, very carefully scrutinized, and of course, even there, people don\u2019t only run one code base. They run a couple of different code bases, they\u2019re very slow to upgrade, and they take their time to make sure there are no problems, not because they\u2019re expecting back doors, but because they expect bugs that inevitably happen. And if you lose money because of a bug, it doesn\u2019t hurt or sting any less or more than losing it through a back door. So open source code creates an environment in which it is very difficult to introduce changes. The ecosystem around Bitcoin uses a variety of code bases at different levels within the application stack, and they\u2019re written independently in differently languages by different people, and they\u2019re all scrutinizing the main rules that run in consensus and interacting with them and running a barrage of programming tests on those rules to know if something has changed that\u2019s going to affect their software. So, can a programmer introduce a back door? Not really. And they\u2019d have to introduce it in a way to goes unnoticed, and spreads widely, and then gets adopted by multiple stacks, and then can be executed in such a way that causes widespread damage that can\u2019t be fixed by patching or even rolling back the chain. That\u2019s a lot of ifs. And so if you think about it from a probability perspective, the probability of the first thing happening is 10%, the probability of the second thing happening is 10%, so 10% times 10% is 1% \u2014 the probability of the third thing happening \u2014 so you have an exponential decay of probability with every step that you add to this chain. This is why conspiracy theories don\u2019t work. It\u2019s because the probabilities multiply in a way that exponentially decreases the chance of it succeeding. [01:11:49] So, no, you can\u2019t do that. On the other hand, can you create an environment in which development is hijacked in such a way that others can\u2019t develop alternative paths or follow alternative attempts to develop the code or disagree with big decisions. I think that was answered conclusively in August of 2017. And the answer is, that although development teams can build their own, and can fork off from Bitcoin, and then can solicit the businesses, the owners, the wallets, the exchanges, etc., to follow their version. Now, you\u2019re gonna hear a lot of people say, but censorship and bullying prevented this from succeeding, and I don\u2019t believe that, because when Bitcoin started, nobody believed in it, it was absolutely censored everywhere, there was plenty of bullying from major financial circles, and yet Bitcoin did succeed, because it could succeed on the merits. And I would argue that alternative teams that have tried to implement changes to the Bitcoin code, have failed on the merits, because they have failed to maintain it, to develop features that people actually want, to follow the conservative ethos that the market is demonstrating through its choices whether you agree with it or not, and have failed to appeal to the businesses, and the users in the ecosystem to follow them. But, if it was in fact the case, that the developers tried to pull a coup, where they try to push changes or prevent changes that were broadly desired \u2014 they would fail on the merits. Other people could very easily bootstrap that code, run it independently with the changes that they want, and maintain it by attracting the best talent in the space. And, you know, we can talk about all of the conspiracies for why that happened for some of the forks for Bitcoin. But the bottom line is that that represents a supreme lack of faith in the ability of the market to discern the merits of different solutions. And I trust the market, bottom line. There is no amount of censorship that could make a solution that is inferior and peer to peer. Not over the long term."}

We\u2019re getting into one more and then I\u2019m gonna leave with one question. So Satoshi, the million Bitcoin, moving some of those coins? What\u2019s the likelier of that?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: I mean it\u2019s possible at some point that that happens. I think it\u2019s extremely unlikely. Honestly, we don\u2019t know if Satoshi is still alive, quite honestly. And we certainly don\u2019t know if they still have control and access to the keys in order to use them. This is unknown. An unknown doesn\u2019t mean that I think they\u2019re not alive, or I think they don\u2019t have control. It really does mean unknown, they might, they might not, there is zero possibility of going one way or another, because we don\u2019t have the information to make that determination. So, from that perspective, there is a possibility, but that possibility gets slimmer with time, meaning that, Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared since 2010 and none of the Bitcoin has ever moved. 10 years later, that fact, not only hasn\u2019t changed, but it\u2019s had 10 years piled on top of it. So if you follow the general logic year, every year that passes cements the probability that they\u2019re not going to move. If they did move, it would be a shock to the system, for sure. It would be a shock to the system because it would demonstrate one of two possibilities: one, that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s keys have been accessed, and someone controls them and is able to move, either Satoshi themselves, or somebody who managed to get access to those keys, inherit TXs to those keys, find those keys, whatever. The second possibility, ironically, goes back to the previous discussion that we had, which is that a quantum computer has cracked those keys. Especially with some of the early keys, they are paid to public keys so the public key is visible, and the money\u2019s sitting in them. So, therefore, a quantum computer, its first target, its juiciest target, its easiest to attack target, is the Satoshi stash. So, how do we know if a quantum computer exists that can break ECDSA? Simple! Satoshi\u2019s coins start moving. In fact at some point after a decade or so, it might actually be the more likely explanation. So you see the coins moving and you\u2019re like, Did Satoshi come back from the dead? Or, did a quantum computer emerge that can break these? As the years go by, I start leaning more towards, Okay, it appears that a quantum computer has emerged that can do this. But I think we\u2019re still a decade away from that. It would cause a massive amount of volatility in the space by injecting an enormous amount of liquidity on the supply side of Bitcoin. But it would also once and for all resolve the question, and so you probably know\u2014I think this is characteristic of markets \u2014 which is, what\u2019s the thing? Sell the rumor, buy the fact? The fact that there\u2019s uncertainty, can cause a lot of volatility. Something starts happening, but it\u2019s unexpected. The markets react badly. But as soon as that becomes expected, you get the opposite reaction. The markets go, Oh, well, I guess Satoshi\u2019s coins moved. Bitcoin didn\u2019t die completely, its price dipped. Well now, Bitcoin, at whatever price it\u2019s priced in now, is a Bitcoin in which Satoshi\u2019s coins have moved, and are therefore part of the supply and priced in. Therefore, its future is now certain. That is no longer hanging over it. Which, usually, traders react to very optimistically at that point, because you remove that big chunk of uncertainty. Sometimes, having the bad news confirmed, leads to a rally in the markets, because you went from uncertainty, to confirmation, even though what\u2019s being confirmed is bad news."}

Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Simon Dixon [01:19:22]: Okay, so I think this is a nice place to conclude it up. I think it seems like the biggest risk to Bitcoin is that Bitcoin becomes so statistically and geopolitically significant in the world that a coordinated effort by all the governments all around the world, and the IMF and the World Bank and the Bank of International Settlement all get together and they create their central bank world global digital currency, and simultaneously invent a quantum computer, and attack the Satoshi keys. And that seems like the risk that Bitcoin fails. If that\u2019s not it, what, in your consideration, is the biggest risk to Bitcoin?"}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/Suk1YNRmuxQ", "title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "text": "Andreas Antonopoulos: The biggest risk to Bitcoin in my opinion is fragmentation within the community and a dilution of the fundamental principles. The biggest risk in Bitcoin is that people who are in Bitcoin already, forget why we got into it, and get seduced by the possibility of riches to sell out all of the principles that make Bitcoin special, and basically hand the baton to something that replaces Bitcoin because it actually achieves the principles that Bitcoin espouses more effectively. We give up on privacy, fungibility, censorship resistance, neutrality, borderless operation, open access, limited monetary supply. We start giving up on those principles one by one, compromising and turning Bitcoin into more and more and more of a Disney version of Bitcoin, right? We polish the rough edges, we take off the sharp corners, we make it more palatable to the investors, we make it more suitable for PayPal to do KYC, we introduce controls so that the IMF if more comfortable with it, we make it so that they are more and more comfortable with it, which makes it less and less effective. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t get attacked if it doesn\u2019t threaten anything. So one way to stop it from getting attacked is to make it completely unthreatening, by removing its fangs, by disarming it, by making it useless. And that can only happen from the inside. That can only happen by capitulation of the principles by those who are invested in it, and who decide that, in the end this wasn\u2019t about creating a system where we don\u2019t have rulers. In the end this wasn\u2019t about creating a system without intermediaries. In the end it was simply about replacing the corrupt intermediaries, rulers, and controllers of the past, with me, you, or whoever else, because that\u2019s greed, right? And so, when people say, how about we just make me in charge, and then we don\u2019t need to worry about not having anyone in charge? That\u2019s how these systems fail. Honestly at this point, given the fact that the recipe of Bitcoin, the concept, its implications, and the ideas and principles behind it have become so widespread and so easy to replicate, I think that that kills Bitcoin, but it doesn\u2019t kill the movement that Bitcoin started. If the community capiulates its principles, all that will do is, they\u2019ll get replaced by a system that doesn\u2019t capitulate those principles. Some other system manages to be more principled than Bitcoin and becomes the new Bitcoin. And in many ways, as I\u2019ve said before, there is a strong possibility at that point that we simply name this new system Bitcoin, and pretend that nothing changed. The brand itself might survive the instance of the technology, if it still carries the principles."}

So if we wanna go through my whole biography, I really think it starts in 2005, which is probably long before Bitcoin was written. And I got interested in Libertarianism through Wikipedia. I\u2019ve learned most of the things I know through Wikipedia probably, not through school. So I went down that rabbit hole and became a gold bug, and I was into silver."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard: Oh yeah, for sure. So I was a junior in high school, and I was reading about Libertarianism I came across this Austrian economics website called mises.org. And I subscribed to their newsletter [01:41] and so I would get this in my inbox, and one of the topics they would talk about is the business cycle. And the business cycle is a macroeconomic phenomenon that the Austrian school has done research on long before the global financial crisis in 2008. There was a lot of research done on what causes instability in the financial system and really the conclusion I came to from reading the material they were putting out was that it\u2019s a combination of fractional reserve banking and central banking that causes the business cycle to happen. And the only solution to that is to take the power of the printing press out of the hands of the government, out of the hands of central authorities. And the closest, the least-worst solution, in my mind, was 100% reserve banking with gold. And that\u2019s kind of where I was at probably around 2006. And even before I learned about Bitcoin, or before it existed, I did theorize about, hypothetically, one could have a money with an absolutely fixed supply. [02:51] And that that would actually be better than gold, because people produce gold every day. But I wasn\u2019t a computer scientist or anything. So in college I majored in Accounting, I started my career at Deloitte doing audits of mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and all that stuff. Crazy fiat finance stuff. In any case, I learned about Bitcoin twice: the first time I heard about it was on Slashdot, so I was already, even in high school, when I was learning about Libertarianism, I was also learning about open source software, and learning how to install Linux on my computer, listening to Richard Stallman lectures about how free software is great for users."}

So yeah I was just a weird kid, I was living in France at that point. I had a few friends but it was pretty much just me on the Internet trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in the world. The other thing is that, from moving between France and the US, I think that I became kind of political in the sense that I saw how people could have radically different views of what makes the economy run.

And that they wanted to create an aristocratic ruling class that could directly tax the people in the United States, and also issue bonds and benefit the commercial interests of financiers and people like Alexander Hamilton that we make musicals about being heroes today, but that there was kind of an underlying profit motive to the whole operation. And also that they aggressively used fake news in order to give the colonists the impression that there were Deep State conspiracies in London afoot. And that the king was made out to be \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like if Alex Jones took over the mainstream media, right? And he started putting in place this mind virus of, Hey, guess what? King George is going to take all of our liberties away, and every single thing he does is a frog boiling in the pot. Whereas, the historians look at what conversations are going on in Parliament and in King George\u2019s cabinet, and it\u2019s just a completely different story. That, in reality, they were just trying to figure out how to balance the finances of this empire, and keep enemies at bay, and kind of just keep everyone happy. It\u2019s not like they were out to get anyone. It\u2019s like, if you went to Afghanistan today, the Afghanis probably have misconceptions about why the United States is there, and what their true intent is, right? [07:46] They probably think that, like, They\u2019re here to steal our minerals, they\u2019re here to steal our resources, they\u2019re here to grow drugs. And maybe some of that is going on, but fundamentally the political motive is, We got attacked on 9/11, and then we can \u2014 we don\u2019t have to go into CIA blowback in Saudia Arabia and all that. So that\u2019s my more nuanced view. But again, I have no way of verifying this, right? I can\u2019t run an American Revolutionary War full node and download the history of it and verify it."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard: The central concept is that, if we take the proposition that nobody should commit acts of violence or aggression against other people \u2014 if we just take that to its logical extreme, then there really shouldn\u2019t be a state that has a monopoly on aggression, because we\u2019ve ruled out the possibility, or the legitimacy, of ever there being aggression that is not in self-defense. So that just excludes the possibility of a state. And so I do take that proposition seriously. Now the secondary question is, Ok, How would that be enforceable? How would we prevent the state from committing acts of aggression? Because, ultimately, whoever is strongest is gonna be able to assert and defend their rights. And, if we look at human history there was a turning point when we had firearms. That\u2019s when we actually were able to have rights that were enforceable by the citizenry against the warrior class in society. Because now, even a female who is very weak, or a male who is very weak \u2014 I don\u2019t wanna be sexist, is able to own a firearm and level the playing field with someone who wields a broadsword, or has a giant axe. And that was kind of a huge deal in human development. And so that technology leveled the playing field. And now, obviously, there are people trying to undo that because what happens when you have broad ownership of firearms is that, there\u2019s negative externalities of crime, but there\u2019s also positive externalities of \u2014 there\u2019s going to be limits to state power, and you can\u2019t just go full totalitarian, communist Chinese surveillance state. Conceivably \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. We can argue about the NSA or whatever. [19:03] So there\u2019s that technology, and so from that insight of \u2014 the less it costs for individuals to defend themselves from aggression, then the less aggression there\u2019s going to be. And so I think it actually goes even further into \u2014 now, in the Digital Age, where cameras are a big part of that, so phones that have cameras on them. I think phones with cameras on them are going to reduce the amount of violence inflicted by, for example, police officers, right? So Rodney King \u2014 Rodney King happened way worse, lots more times before there was video, before the invention of video, and before the costs of video came down low enough that you could have a helicopter with video. And so there\u2019s so many parts to this, right? And it\u2019s kind of the same thing actually during the Civil Rights movement. When video came out of white police officers using dogs against black protesters, and using hoses against peaceful black protesters, this actually shocked the nation, right? That, Wait, hold on, these people are just marching in the street, why are you attacking them unprovoked? That\u2019s completely unacceptable. They have first amendment rights, you can\u2019t just attack people like this. And if it was white people on the receiving end of it, it would just not stand, right? So I do think that technology has a huge influence on our ability to assert rights, both in terms of kinetic \u2014 shooting a bullet, but also in terms of psychological warfare and mass media and the ability to publicize abuse and whatnot. Now, okay, so let\u2019s take it to cryptography and Bitcoin. Well, so we can apply this concept to gold as well. Alright, I\u2019m going on a wild tangent here because we\u2019re talking about anarcho-capitalism, but basically the idea is that I think that the technological progress is going to allow us to reach an anarcho-capitalist society, where we no longer actually need the state to enforce property rights, because we\u2019ll have autonomous robots that will physically remove you from the property if you invade someone\u2019s home."}

[22:53] And what \u201csavings\u201d they do have is maybe in their 401(k), so it\u2019s not really liquid or tappable. It\u2019s not true savings \u2014 it\u2019s an investment.

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard [23:15]: Basically, I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m bullish on Bitcoin, and then I\u2019ll explain how to approach it from a personal finance perspective. So I think that Bitcoin is going through this process of going from having zero value to having all of the monetary value in the world. So then we can think about Where is the monetary value currently? And Why is that monetary value going to transfer to Bitcoin? So where it is currently is primarily in US dollars, and US dollar-denominated government debt (treasuries). After gold, the US dollar was able to become the world reserve currency. And so, today, the entire international monetary system and international financial system is centered around the dollar. Everything from: having contracts be dollar-denominated, to, the most liquid equities and derivatives exchanges are all in the US and in dollar and all of that. Basically, the reason you end up with a world reserve currency \u2014 and before, it was gold in various forms \u2014 is that the whole point of a money is that people don\u2019t have to barter. And so you have one singular asset that is the most liquid asset that people are going to use for what economists call indirect exchange. Where, it\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m trading with you because I need what you have, it\u2019s: I\u2019m trading with you because I need money that I\u2019m going to then go spend somewhere else with someone who has what I need. So indirect exchange\u2014in the free market process \u2014 one good is going to reach the top of the liquidity stack. So it\u2019s gonna have to have certain properties. I would argue that the most important property that it would have is that it\u2019d have some form of verifiable scarcity. So why is that? Well, with a medium of exchange, you don\u2019t really want an abundant amount of it, otherwise it\u2019s not going to hold any value because people are just going to create more of it. [25:41] Whereas, with a commodity, you kind of want an infinite amount of it \u2014 ideally, we would have an infinite amount of oil, right? We don\u2019t want scarce oil, right? In fact, we\u2019re concerned about peak oil. We\u2019re concerned about scarce oil, it\u2019s a problem for civilization. We can talk about global warming, but that\u2019s a different conversation. Whereas, with a money, we would be concerned about too much money being created and inflation, whereas with too little money being created \u2014 now we can debate this, because Keynesians think that that\u2019s a problem \u2014 of deflation, of prices going down. In any case, if we go back to gold versus the dollar and verifiable scarcity, the dollar combined two technologies which allowed it to have better verifiable scarcity than gold. The first one was paper money that actually could not be counterfeited, or where the cost of counterfeiting that paper money was greater than the actual value of the money itself. The cost of making a perfect replica of a $100 bill is greater than a hundred dollars. [26:53] And that cost includes the risk of getting caught and being put in prison! So there\u2019s definitely\u2014the ability to have rule of law, and to have nobody be above the law, enforces the US dollar\u2019s verifiable scarcity. The other part of the equation was the emergence of an institutional technology called independent central banking. Before independent central banking, you had central banks that were either fully controlled by the commercial system \u2014 by banks \u2014 or they were fully controlled by the sovereign \u2014 by the government, or by the prince, or by the Roman emperor \u2014 we can go that far back. But you didn\u2019t have an independent central bank in the Roman Empire or anything like that, and so they would get themselves in trouble where they would start out with having a gold coin, and then they would start diluting it, and what they would do is they monopolized mints \u2014 they nationalized the mints, because the mints provide the verification technology in gold. It\u2019s way too expensive to take gold nuggets and to verify that they\u2019re pure gold, right? You have to standardize the gold using a minting technology \u2014 and mints used to be private, where it was like a brand like Kellogg\u2019s or whatever \u2014 but governments took it over because they understood strategically, if you want to pay for the war machine, it\u2019s nice to have access to a mint. [28:32] And it\u2019s nice to be able to dilute things out and to pay your troops with diluted coin and all this. In any case, that verification technology was easily co-opted. Now, let\u2019s contrast all these with Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you run your software on your computer that does this verification. So, you don\u2019t have to trust a mint, you don\u2019t have to trust a government, and you don\u2019t have to trust an independent central bank, and you don\u2019t have to trust a counterfeit bill detector. All you have to trust is the developers \u2014 and you don\u2019t even really have to trust them either, because it\u2019s open-source. So if you have the software development chops, you can go and audit the code yourself and look things over, or, write the code yourself, right? People have done that, they\u2019ve written their own implementation of a Bitcoin node. So you don\u2019t even really have to trust anyone, at the end of the day. Some people say you have to trust Intel, because we\u2019re all running this on Intel processors. [29:25] We can go down that rabbit hole if you want."}

What do you think about, like, when there are threats? People will say, Can the government ban or co-opt Bitcoin? What do you think about that? I don\u2019t believe in that. And obviously Bitcoin is agnostic. But, you know, as a US citizen who owns KYC\u2019d Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s a small concern."}
{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah it really comes down to the cost of seizing the Bitcoin, or of banning the Bitcoin. So, to seize it \u2014 one of the interesting things is that, if you ever look at the different between a bank account and Bitcoin, it\u2019s that the government can very easily seize a bank account. And the reason they can do that is because our constitutional protections around due process and arbitrary search and seizure have been undermined over the past decades by efforts from progressives and from the IRS and from law enforcement and from prosecutors, to undermine our rights. And so now, a bank account no longer has the constitutional protections that your home safe has. So if you keep gold or if you keep $100 bills in your safe, in your house, it has more legal protections to it than if you keep your dollars in a bank account with a third party. And that should not be the case, right? There\u2019s no reason for that to be the case, other than the Supreme Court being corrupted, frankly, by fiat law. In any case \u2014 because it\u2019s not like the Constitution has been amended, right? There\u2019s no constitutional amendment that says, The government now has a right to seize your bank account. It really is just that \u2014 they see it as, Well, in order to collect taxes, we have to do this! And the Constitution says that we\u2019re supposed to collect taxes, so we\u2019re gonna have to do this. [31:47] Now, they know that they cannot extend that logic to your house. So if they want to seize cash that\u2019s in a safe, they have to go get a warrant and be able to prove things out that they have probably cause and all of this. They can\u2019t just do civil asset forfeiture and barge into your house like they do with the drug war \u2014 we could talk about that. So all this to say that the cost of seizing Bitcoin \u2014 so let\u2019s say they could, right? That they are able to do that, like they do with drugs. So they can barge into anyone\u2019s house, and, without respecting due process or private property, they can assault people, they can kill dogs, they can accidentally shoot your wife, they can kill people, light houses on fire \u2014 they do this regularly as part of the war on drugs, with zero accountability, because they have sovereign immunity. [32:51] So these agents of the government are completely unaccountable and irresponsible in their day to day actions, committing gross negligence left and right, destroying property, and so you could argue, Well, okay, this is already going on for drugs, so it could happen for Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s entirely valid. So that\u2019s why I think the Second Amendment is so important. Ultimately, the only person who could defend your private property is yourself, because the people assaulting you might be agents of the state, or they might be criminals who present themselves as agents of the state. You have no way of verifying that, when someone assaults you and says that they\u2019re police, how are you gonna know that they actually are police? And this happens all the time where criminals will literally wear police badges and impersonate police, and that\u2019s why they have to make police impersonation illegal in the first place, right? Because criminals do this. Now the problem is that, criminals are already criminals. They don\u2019t care about adding on a few charges of police impersonation \u2014 they\u2019re already assaulting you, they might already be about to murder you, so they don\u2019t really care about getting another charge on their rap sheet. So it\u2019s kind of a ridiculous situation. [34:03] And we saw this play out with Breonna Taylor \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you read about this story?"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, so they\u2019re searching for drugs, okay? So already it\u2019s like, Why? Why are you guys doing that? There\u2019s no reason to be doing that. The number one drug dealer in the US is Big Pharma. They\u2019re the ones who are pushing opiates onto people, and then the tax-payers are paying for all of these opiates, so it\u2019s pretty crazy that the government thinks it has any kind of moral high ground on this topic. But anyways, they\u2019re searching for drugs, I guess, maybe they\u2019re anti-competition, right? They\u2019re trying to prevent competition with Big Pharma. And, you know, these are white police officers. To them, they\u2019re kind of in a foreign country when they go and attack drug dealers, and attack their families. [34:57] They\u2019re an occupying force, and that\u2019s why you see them wear military fatigues. They get into tactical gear, they get inside of armored personnel carriers, with 50-caliber sniper rifles, like \u2014 they\u2019re in Iraq as far as they\u2019re concerned. A lot of them are Iraq vets, and they might have PTSD or otherwise unresolved psychological problems, and also they have all these legal protections that we talked about so they can do no wrong. So they go to people\u2019s houses, they do these things called no-knock warrants. So I mentioned the dangers of someone saying that they\u2019re police, but they don\u2019t even have to say they\u2019re police. So they\u2019re just, like, busting people\u2019s doors down and not announcing themselves, not serving a warrant, not getting on the loudspeaker and saying, Hey! Come out with your hands up! We\u2019ve got your house surrounded \u2014 we think you\u2019re a criminal! That\u2019s like what a normal police would do\u2014You\u2019re under arrest! Sorry we have to do this! But instead, they blow down people\u2019s front doors, and then they got shot at \u2014 obviously, they\u2019re gonna get shot at, because you have heavily armed civilians who are interested in protecting their families from violent criminals. And there\u2019s a violent criminal blowing down their door, so I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t expect to shot? [36:34] If you\u2019re busting down someone\u2019s door, your primary expectation should be that they\u2019re gonna shoot at you immediately, and they have every right to! Of course they do! You haven\u2019t even announced yourselves. And then they start shooting back, and they kill your girlfriend, and that\u2019s what happened with Breonna Taylor. And then the prosecutor, he filed charges against the police officers for the bullets that missed Breonna Taylor, because the bullets went into other homes, and they said that was reckless. Anyway, maybe this is more about Libertarianism than about Bitcoin."}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard [37:38]: Yeah. In mainstream economics, Hayek is kind of known for this, but it precedes Hayek and it transcends Hayek, which is Price as decentralized information. It\u2019s basically the output of the process between supply and demand, and there\u2019s two levels to it. And people who know about trading know this. There\u2019s the order book, where it\u2019s kind of the prices at which people are willing to buy and sell goods. And so everyone\u2019s walking around with an order book in their head\u2014for basically every single service and good under the sun, right? Where people are gonna say, Yeah, I would pay $5 for a ticket to the moon, if that was offered. I wouldn\u2019t pay $5 million\u2014I mean I can\u2019t afford $5 million for anything, so that\u2019s out of reach. And so there\u2019s no clearing price. On the other hand, you go to the supermarket and toothpaste might be $3, and you\u2019re like, Okay, well I\u2019d be willing to pay $10 for toothpaste, but if they\u2019re gonna sell it to me for $3, that\u2019s fine too, I won\u2019t argue with them. And then \u2014 you have a deal! Now the value of the toothpaste you\u2019re buying is greater than its price. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re gonna go buy it. And that\u2019s a market buy. If you know about order books, you know the difference between limit orders \u2014 which is the price you\u2019re willing to pay \u2014 and the market order \u2014 where it\u2019s just the price you\u2019re gonna pay right now, and you\u2019re gonna put down some cash for it. And then the producers of goods also have limit order books, where the toothpaste manufacturer knows that, Okay, in order to manufacture this toothpaste, we\u2019re gonna have to put $2 of cost into it, and then we also want to have some profit margins, so let\u2019s put it at $3 or whatever. Although really, actually, that\u2019s not how they should set prices. How they should set prices is: What is the market willing to bear? How high of a price can we charge people before they start complaining and going to our competitors? [39:51] And so that\u2019s kind of how the market actually functions in some cases. In other cases, it\u2019s more of like a cost-plus type situation, and it really depends on how defensible of a market position do they have? How strong is their brand? Because if they\u2019ve got a weak brand, then they can\u2019t charge a premium. Apple can charge 50% profit margins, because, at what price-point do you decide, I\u2019m not gonna buy an iPhone, I\u2019m gonna buy an Android instead? Apparently it\u2019s like a thousand dollars! Because that\u2019s where the current price of a good iPhone is, you know? Now, obviously you can get a used iPhone for a lot less, and so maybe that\u2019s the way to look at the market: Apple is competing old Apple \u2014 so the secondary market. And that\u2019s the case in the stocks as well. So the stock market is like the secondary market for equity. [40:43] So it\u2019s people buying and selling old, used stocks. And then there\u2019s the primary market of IPOs. We\u2019ve seen some IPOs recently of businesses raising capital because \u2014 now, okay, so what happens when the government intervenes in these markets? What happens when the government decides that the price of stocks is too low, so we as the government are gonna start buying stocks? Not only that, but they\u2019re also just gonna start printing money to buy stocks. They\u2019re not gonna take the money from any other part of the system. They actually are taking money from a different part of the system: what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re diluting out people who hold USD. People who hold money \u2014 cash, USD, in any form, and including people who hold government treasuries, because government treasuries are actually the same thing as cash at this point, because governments have already said that they\u2019re gonna buy all their treasuries, by creating new dollars. So the Federal Reserve \u2014 and you\u2019ll see Jerome Powell, who\u2019s the current chairman, or Neel Kashkari also has a video of him saying this, where they say, We\u2019ll buy an infinite number of bonds in order to stabilize the economy. We\u2019ll create an infinite amount of cash in order to provide liquidity to the system so that it continues to function. And that\u2019s why interest rates are going to zero, because a 0% interest bond is cash, right? It\u2019s just the same way of saying it\u2019s cash, you\u2019re just giving it a different name, because the whole thing about cash is that it\u2019s 0%. It just sits there. Whereas, a loan \u2014 you earn interest on a loan. If you\u2019re lending the money and taking on risk, there\u2019s no reason why you would ever lend out cash, if you\u2019re taking on risk. But if you\u2019re lending cash to the government, you\u2019re not actually taking on any risk, and they\u2019re making this very clear to everyone, and so thus, it\u2019s 0%. And it\u2019s risk-free, right? They say, Hey, the risk-free interest rate is whatever treasury yields are. So, alright, let\u2019s take \u2019em at their word and that\u2019s 0%. [43:04] Anyway, when the government is spending money, usually it\u2019s deficit spending, I think it\u2019s like 30 \u2014 any additional incremental spending is gonna be deficit spending, right? Nobody\u2019s raising taxes at this point, and they\u2019re also cutting taxes, cutting payroll taxes, deferring taxes, and we can talk about the Coronavirus stuff. But in any case, every time the government is spending, or is buying bonds with the Federal Reserve, they are diluting out USD holders, and they are stealing wealth from people who hold USD. Now, you could say that it\u2019s not really theft, because people who hold US dollars are being given ample forewarning that, like, Hey look, you\u2019re gonna have 2% inflation, you\u2019re gonna get diluted out \u2014 this is their explicit mandate. Which is fair, but when you think about who holds cash the most as a percentage of their balance sheet, it\u2019s actually the people who are living from paycheck to paycheck, because they don\u2019t have the means to hold any other asset, which goes back to our earlier conversation about, well savings technology, that\u2019s all fine and well, but what about people who are living who are living from paycheck to paycheck? Their problem right now, is that they get their first paycheck, and so they\u2019ve got, let\u2019s say, $1000 in the bank. And they\u2019re gonna spend it down over the course of a month, until their next paycheck, and so they\u2019re gonna get another $1000. Living paycheck to paycheck is another way of saying living off of cash. Not having the ability to accumulate capital which would allow you to invest in stocks, which are not getting diluted out, right? In fact, they are where the dilution is going. They are where \u201cMoney printer go BRRR\u201d \u2014 that shows itself in the stocks going up, and that\u2019s why \u2014"}

And he\u2019s right! Now the problem is that people who are living paycheck to paycheck, they don\u2019t live from Apple share to Apple share, right? Where, for the month that they\u2019re holding that cash and drawing against it, it\u2019s going up in value because it\u2019s Apple shares, right? No, quite the opposite \u2014 their purchasing power is going down, and so they\u2019re not even treading water. They\u2019re drowning! And the government is drowning them, because the government is making it such that the cash that they\u2019re holding between paycheck periods is constantly losing value relative to both consumer goods that they\u2019re spending money on, but also capital goods and real estate that they\u2019re also spending money on indirectly through rents. So rents are going up, people can\u2019t even get ahead, they\u2019ve gotta get a second job, they\u2019ve gotta get a third job, and the government has turned the working class into an increasing inequality of, Okay, we\u2019re gonna print money to enrich people who have the ability to accumulate assets, who own stocks and real estate \u2014 we\u2019re gonna make them rich, and we\u2019re gonna make everyone else poor. And that\u2019s the government\u2019s explicit policy right now. Same thing with the paycheck protection program. Instead of printing money and giving it to people, we\u2019re gonna print money and give it to the biggest business owners, and then they can give it to the people or not \u2014 we don\u2019t care. So it\u2019s kind of this kleptocracy that\u2019s built up, and it\u2019s not Republican or Democrat, either. Every administration has this same policy, it\u2019s all just about the marketing of Who do they pay lip-service to? Do they press the fear button on the sheep, or do they press the reward of Hey, we\u2019re gonna give you free money, Vote For Me! Or, Hey, be afraid of everyone outside of your community, Vote For Me! So it\u2019s really manipulative."}

But, quickly from $1 trillion to $2 trillion, we gain parity with the US dollar in physical cash, or somewhere close to that, and then I think that things will just accelerate beyond.

So if the last halving has made it such that there\u2019s not really room for a breather because there\u2019s not that supply effect, of supply increasing, then this cycle is going to be fundamentally different \u2014 the price is gonna be $200,000 \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have people who are gonna be like, Alright, time to take gains \u2014 time to sell here! But what if it only goes down 10% to $180,000? And then there\u2019s just more people buying? And then it goes up to like $400,000?"}

{"link": "https://youtu.be/4KE1metoxbg", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast #1 - Pierre Rochard: Accumulating Bitcoin, Libertarianism & Anarcho-Capitalism", "text": "Pierre Rochard [50:41]: Right. And so it\u2019s like, by what metric are we trying to decide where the all-time high is gonna be, and why would I stop and take gains at any point? Because suddenly the expectation becomes, Hey look! The dollar is not long for this world \u2014 why would I want to hold dollar-denominated assets? Maybe I would want to rotate into some equities? Maybe I think stocks are cheap relative to Bitcoin, and I do a little bit of re-balancing at the margin, and maybe that\u2019s the angle? Or, there are companies generating Bitcoin cash flows, and who are using Bitcoin as their treasury reserve asset, and so now I\u2019m starting to think, Alright, well, it\u2019s not really selling Bitcoin if I buy some equity that generates Bitcoin cash flow. I gotta calculate relative yield, and then I\u2019ve gotta do the Warren Buffett value-investing analysis of, Is this security fundamentally undervalued? Today, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to be a value investor. Why would you wanna think that fundamental value matters at all? The Federal Reserve is bidding up everything. There\u2019s no such thing as fundamental value anymore. All you\u2019re doing is playing a game of greater fool, of, Hey look! Stocks only go up! You don\u2019t need to look at P/E ratios. That\u2019s old school. But I think that with Bitcoin, it\u2019s gonna make that popular again, because now it\u2019s no longer like, Okay, I need to dump my inflationary cash that\u2019s getting diluted straight into the stock market, otherwise I\u2019m gonna lose purchasing power, right? And that the stock market has become a store of value, and people use the stock market for savings, and they\u2019re like, Well, I gotta put my money somewhere \u2014 I gotta put my money to work. And with Bitcoin it\u2019s like, No! I can actually just hold cash, and I can be like a poker player. I can wait for the next hand. It\u2019s not like the blinds are increasing, right? With Bitcoin, the blinds are negative. Your Bitcoin purchasing power is gonna be increasing long term, because it is a fixed amount, because it is scarce, and the supply of stocks and the supply of consumer goods is gonna increase, so your purchasing power is gonna increase, and so you can wait until you get investment opportunities that are really interesting to you. And so in the real estate world, they talk about location, location, location. Alright, well, that doesn\u2019t apply when you\u2019re under a fiat system. Under a fiat system you\u2019ve gotta put your money to work as quickly as possible, so you\u2019ve gotta buy whatever real estate properties are on the market whenever you\u2019re looking, right? You can\u2019t just sit on a bunch of cash and wait for a decade until somebody buys a piece of land that you\u2019ve got your eye on. You\u2019ve gotta be working some angle in that 10 years. With Bitcoin you can actually just sit on Bitcoin for 10 years, and when it\u2019s up for grabs, you pounce on it and you pay whatever price."}

So, just as a new technology might incentivize behavior that is kind of underutilized today\u2014of putting money aside for a rainy day \u2014 people, I think, have been incentivized to live a life of consumerism.

Well, I have the perfect toolkit for doing that, because I\u2019m a former auditor, that\u2019s what auditors do, they verify ledger balances. And the blockchain is a ledger. It\u2019s digital ledger technology. So let\u2019s dig in to this ledger \u2014 I know how to do this. So basically, you gotta start with, Alright, how are Bitcoin created? Because with any ledger, you gotta have that beginning ledger entry."}

So you start at zero with the Bitcoin ledger. And then you\u2019ve got the genesis block, so that\u2019s 50 Bitcoin. Guess what? The Bitcoin code won\u2019t actually let anyone spend those 50 Bitcoin, so we\u2019ve already eliminated 50 Bitcoin from the total spendable supply of Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because the genesis block is actually hard-coded into Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because you need a way to bootstrap the truth machine, right? What are you gonna has as the previous valid block if you don\u2019t have a first block? So it\u2019s kind of this chick and egg problem. And Satoshi just solved it by hard-coding it and then saying, Hey look, to be fair\u2014no pre-mine, nobody can spend this, it\u2019s just going to be hard-coded in there. Unlike other blockchains, where they\u2019ll hard-code in a beginning amount, but it goes to them, right?"}

And at this point, I don\u2019t know if Satoshi knows that alt coins are inevitable\u2014probably does, but it just seems incredibly patient and it\u2019s an incredible feat, I think. And kind of giving an incredible legend to the story."}

And if we contrast it with what has gone on since Satoshi, Satoshi was an incredibly ethical founder, as far as cryptocurrency systems go. And he made this 50 Bitcoin provably unspendable, and then everything after that he mined it, he used the Bitcoin algorithm, the SHA-256 squared like anyone else would. The next 50 Bitcoin that were actually mined by Satoshi \u2014 he mined at a loss, because they were worth nothing at the time. And he consumed electricity to produce them. So Bitcoin were created at a loss from the beginning. And so anyone who says, Oh, well Satoshi got this unfair amount, it\u2019s like \u2014 Dude, he got nothing, he got zero dollars, or he got zero amount of value, however you want to put it. He didn\u2019t get any value for free, he actually lost value when he was mining Bitcoin. But you know what? He believed in the project. And so that\u2019s why he mined it, and he made is open source and he released it to the public and he immediately got as many people mining as he could. And ultimately, he couldn\u2019t force other people to adopt Bitcoin. What he could do was explain Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition as he saw it, provide the source code, provide his thought process behind it, and then just hope that people join in and start mining. Anyway, back to the auditing: the way that that 50 Bitcoin is calculated of, Alright, every 10 minutes we\u2019re gonna create new Bitcoin, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna distribute it, and it\u2019s gonna go to the miner, who provides the proof-of-work. I\u2019ll skip over proof-of-work, because if we talk about Bitcoin mining, it\u2019s gonna take the rest of the afternoon."}

Because, more cost can be applied rationally \u2014 we can create more mining hardware, we can actually even use electricity that\u2019s more expensive per kilowatt-hour, and that actually causes blocks to get produced more quickly, and so then, you have a block coming out every 9 minutes, instead of every 10 minutes, which is what we were expecting. And then every 8 minutes. Okay, so what\u2019s the problem here? Well, if that had been the case for Satoshi, he could have instantly mined all 21 million Bitcoin on Day Zero. Because there\u2019s nothing fixing the clock. What Satoshi added\u2014which was genius \u2014 was that every two weeks divided by 10 minutes, every X blocks \u2014"}

And that this would presumably allow us to roll things back or fix them before an extensive amount of damage is done. Now there are other ways of doing this. So one other way of doing this is having different Bitcoin implementations. So the idea being that the inflation bug hopefully is not the same inflation bug in every implementation, and one of the implementations actually does things correctly. But it could conceivably be the case that the same inflation bug shows up in two different implementations. But, at this point I think that\u2019s very, very, very, very low risk. Which is way I\u2019m so confident. To me, it\u2019s lower risk than the risk of a gold asteroid being brought into low-earth orbit and exploited and causing the gold price to crash."}

So you can\u2019t use the Bitcoin network for a gene analysis, DNA analysis, which is what you would use a supercomputer for. You can\u2019t use it for modeling climate change. That\u2019s what you would use a supercomputer for. And then, in terms of it being resistant to attack from others, there\u2019s the mining part, but there\u2019s also the decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes. And so, to the extent that Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is replicated, and it\u2019s consensus rules are being verified by a lot of different people, not just miners, then it is more secure than it otherwise would be."}

At some point \u2014 or not! That\u2019s fine too. They might get stuck somewhere, but, the idea being that, I did not understand Bitcoin until long after I had held some for a while. I didn\u2019t dig into, Okay, how does the UTXO set work, how do Bitcoin inputs and outputs work? I just knew addresses and wallets, for a very long time. And that\u2019s fine! There\u2019s no reason to really dig into it, unless you\u2019re like, Okay, this system, not only is it valuable to me because I have Bitcoin, but it\u2019s also valuable to me because I think that it\u2019s the future. And that the sooner I learn this, the sooner I can start benefitting from it and living in the future. So it\u2019s like, Okay, the Internet has just come out, and let\u2019s say you\u2019re a software developer. Do you want to learn web development now, or do you want to wait? Frankly, I would argue that, if I look back on when I first heard about software development, it was MySQL. MySQL was the database. And so, I could\u2019ve learned SQL back then, but I was reading WIRED magazine and I was like, Oh, software development is gonna be obsolete because it\u2019s all gonna get outsourced to India. And so I was like, Okay, I don\u2019t need to learn SQL. Fast-forward 20 years, literally 20 years, everyone\u2019s still using SQL. If I had learned SQL that would\u2019ve been an excellent job skill to have from the Day Zero of having a job! It\u2019s a great skill to have! So I think that there\u2019s technologies that are Lindy, that are going to be around for a long time, that are going to be hugely valuable and powerful, and you might as well just learn them now, because you\u2019re gonna have to learn them at some point, and the longer you put it off, the less you\u2019re gonna benefit from it over your lifetime."}

In today\u2019s special seminar we have a very special guest, Mr. Michael Saylor, the CEO of Microstrategy, a publicly traded company that has just announced the purchase of more than $400 million worth of Bitcoin, to use as their primary treasury asset. Mr. Saylor has very gracefully and thankfully accepted my invitation to come and join us in this seminar so we can discuss his company\u2019s move and how it relates to Bitcoin and The Bitcoin Standard, seeing that he publicly said this was an attempt to put his company on a Bitcoin standard. So I think we\u2019ll hopefully find a lot to discuss, and a lot of common ground. Thank you so much Michael for joining."}

So, from a selfish perspective, and from the perspective of many other people in this seminar, I guess we could probably begin by asking you: we know that you\u2019ve read The Bitcoin Standard, but what did you think? What were your impressions?"}

I guess the best compliment I can give you is I read your book and I invested $425 million in Bitcoin. But actually, you know there\u2019s some people that read about Bitcoin and they decide they\u2019re gonna buy some, and there\u2019s some people that read about it, you know, first it\u2019s a speculation\u2014I\u2019m gonna buy some, and then some people read and think, I\u2019m gonna buy a lot, and some people read about Bitcoin and they think it\u2019s cool technology, and they wanna get on the train. I think that The Bitcoin Standard is amazing, because it got me over those hurdles to realize that it\u2019s not really about buying a lot, it\u2019s actually about inverting the balance sheet of the company. What we were doing was that we were inverting the balance sheet such that we\u2019re floating on a Bitcoin sail, on a crypto sail if you will, and as the liquidity and the monetary system gets pumped up, we want it to float, rather than sink, on that pool of liquidity. And I think that lots of other people in the Bitcoin industry have written a lot of stuff that is very interesting, but I thought that your book put it all together in a very compelling way. And so, it was probably the most impactful of all the stuff I\u2019d looked at on our way of thinking."}

At the point in the book where you say that in the last decade, the monetary system has been expanding by 7% a year: I think we\u2019ve been conditioned to think, well, 2% inflation \u2014 therefore 2% monetary expansion, and it never registered with me that even in normal times, you were getting 7% monetary expansion, or 8%, and then once I saw that, it all clicked for me, and I realized that a lot of the problem that we had was we were sitting on too much cash, and if you have $500 million in cash, and you make $500 million in operating income every year, then you have $35 million in after-tax cash-flow, which is equal to 7% of your cash balance, which meant that our asset purchasing power was deteriorating as fast as we were generating income, and we weren\u2019t gonna get ahead, no matter how hard we worked, and it was a big epiphany. And that was before 2020. Obviously, after 2020, things changed."}

I was really intrigued by your discussion with Stephan Livera in his podcast on inflation. It\u2019s a drum that I\u2019ve beaten for many, many years. But I thought your idea of saying that inflation, that there are three types of goods within an economy: (1) the goods that drop in price every year \u2014 technology, and goods that require heavy or high initial costs, initial fixed costs, and then low marginal costs \u2014 these tend to decline in price, and then you have (2) the goods that rise at a small rate\u2014labor and land, basically undifferentiated labor and land if you want, not the most skilled labor and not the most desirable land and property \u2014 these things appreciate at around 1%, 2%, 3% every year, and then there\u2019s (3) the desirable, truly scarce things that people compete for, and these are the things where the inflation is 6%, 7%, 8% and maybe even up to 20% a year. And I think that was really an eye-opening way of thinking about it and I had not thought about it before. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve written something about this somewhere, or if you\u2019ve come across it somewhere, because I think it\u2019s a very useful framework that I intend to use in my next book, so where do I cite that?"}
{"link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/bitcoinpodcasts/sem-sep24", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "text": "Michael Saylor [05:56]: The truth of the matter is, again it\u2019s back to this propaganda rule: we can\u2019t tell people what to think, we can tell them what to think about. If we keep repeating, \u201cInflation is CPI\u2026CPI\u2026CPI,\u201d and then everything\u2019s CPI \u2014 we didn\u2019t get 2% \u2014 oh, there\u2019s no inflation \u2014 everybody\u2019s waiting for inflation. The big misconception is that a number is a scalar, and of course, anybody in engineering, if you\u2019re studying fluid dynamics, there\u2019s not a number. It\u2019s a vector. And a vector could be a stack of \u2014 if I stacked up a hundred different things I can give you a hundred different inflation rates. And I could give you a two-dimensional vector. And I could give you a three-dimensional vector. And vector calculus, and fluid dynamics \u2014 it gets pretty complicated. If I said to you, Look at this swirl of the water in a whirlpool, and you asked me, well what\u2019s the velocity of the water? I would say, Well it depends\u2014it\u2019s a vector. It depends upon which component you pick out. So the truth is, I bought into the lie of CPI until I read your book, Saifedean. And then at that point it was like, Oh it\u2019s going up 7%. And then I thought, Wow, everything that I really want to buy is going up. You know, my MIT education went up more than 2%, healthcare goes up more than 2%, I\u2019ve got a house on Miami beach on two acres, cost $100,000 in 1930, it would cost you $20 million today. You know, it didn\u2019t go up 2%. And then I started thinking, Well, everything\u2019s scarce, and then I thought, Hampton\u2019s real estate doesn\u2019t go up 2%, Manhattan real estate doesn\u2019t go up 2%. And then it tripped to this horrific observation that a $1 million bond yields $50,000 in 2010, and then a $1 million bond today gives you $5,000. So a bond went up by 1,000% in ten years, and then you back solve that \u2014 that\u2019s 22% inflation per year in the last decade, and that\u2019s before we hit the financial crisis. And then I realized, the inflation rate is the thing that you choose to track, so we know that \u2014 when I wrote The Mobile Wave in 2012, my thesis was, mobile networks are dematerializing products and services. And that means, if you dematerialize a camera, or you dematerialize a photo, or you dematerialize a DVD or a CD or a tape recorder, and on your iPhone, you\u2019ve got a tape recorder, and you\u2019ve got a camera, and you dematerialize a credit card, I mean all these things they\u2019ve dematerialized, they\u2019re deflationary and they\u2019re going to zero. And the reason Apple\u2019s the most valuable company on Earth is because they can ship a dematerialized product to a billion people for a nickel. There\u2019s never gonna be any inflation if you wanna measure that \u2014 put that in your market basket \u2014 because there\u2019s no variable cost. And then you just have to come up with a vector of all these things, and of course, What\u2019s got a variable cost? Well, if I give you a piece of paper that gives you the right to never work again the rest of your life and have as much money as you want? Would you like that? That\u2019s scarce \u2014 that\u2019s going up. Because Apple can\u2019t dematerialize infinite power and money forever. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is, right? Power and money forever. So what happens? I mean, you point out in your book, and I read all your papers after your book \u2014 you kept me up late, Saifedean, the last two nights. And I\u2019m reading, Anything that goes up in price, mankind can manufacture, given enough time and money, and chemistry. [09:56] So you think well fracking, right? The solution to the oil crisis was not to go to war in the Gulf. The solution to the oil crisis was: Let the price of oil go up. And when the price of oil got to $100 a barrel, then Wall Street raised $50 billion worth of capital, put it into fracking, invented fracking and doubled the oil production in the United States, and the problem that was a hundred-year-old problem that everybody kept talking about\u2014the scarcity of oil \u2014 became a non-problem. So, the real question is, across all this array of products and services, you know, you want your nails done? You want your hair cut? You want caesar salad prepared table-side? Caesar salads table-side by a person with a tuxedo with a nice hair-cut, that\u2019s polite and speaks your language? It\u2019s gonna be more expensive. So the real issue is, can I manufacture with a robot \u2014 by the way, if I can, what\u2019s the variable cost? And as the variable cost falls, and as the capital intensity increases it becomes less deflationary and of course, the companies that are worth more money than God right now? Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, all have the same thing in common: they\u2019re manufacturing products and services with a zero variable cost. [11:41] If everybody at Google went on vacation for the rest of the year, and didn\u2019t show up to work \u2014 every single one of \u2018em \u2014 you probably wouldn\u2019t notice. Like, YouTube would keep working, Google would keep working, there\u2019s not a single person involved in the delivery of the value proposition. The only thing they\u2019re doing is creating the next version of the information factory. So you would notice in 2021 when they don\u2019t add a new feature to YouTube, but in fact the variable cost of Google is electricity and data \u2014 it\u2019s the data center, it\u2019s the electricity and the server spinning. So, you know really, once you come to that conclusion there\u2019s a vector \u2014 let\u2019s just make it a one-dimensional array. I described three buckets, but Saifedean the really interesting thing is, would anybody have guessed that the most inflationary, the best asset is a government bond yielding 3% interest. That seems the stupidest thing you could possibly buy, right? If you\u2019re a rational person. But the long bond index went up by 22% this year. So, you\u2019ve got 25% inflation, S&P can show you 8% inflation, I can find you, you know, New York, Manhattan \u2014 you want a penthouse on Central Park that\u2019s 8,000 square feet with a perfect view? Seems kind of scarce. It is scarce but if you go to $100 million and Ken Griffin offers $100 million, they will build you a hundred-story skyscraper on a pad\u2014and they built a bunch of \u2019em on Billionaire\u2019s Row \u2014 and they\u2019ll sell you one apartment for $100 million. At a certain price, and there\u2019s floors 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of scarcity if you build up. So, there\u2019s an entire theory of inflation, everybody says, Well you\u2019re only inflating 2% a year or 3%, well asset inflation is a vector too. S&P went up 8%, bonds went up 20%. That\u2019s a vector. You know, gold didn\u2019t go up as much, right? So gold was an asset that inflated differently. So once you\u2019ve done that, now there\u2019s a concept we\u2019ll call Cost of Capital. [14:35] I\u2019ve got $500 million in my treasury: what\u2019s my cost of capital? Well, you\u2019ve gotta norm it against the asset inflation rate of something. I could peg it at 8%. It\u2019s a simplistic notion. It\u2019s definitely not 2%. But of course, now every product and service as defined has an intrinsic buoyancy. Everything has a buoyancy, so there\u2019s a multiple: the Fed prints a trillion dollars. Bonds inflate immediately. Stocks to a lesser extent. Gold to a certain extent. Farmland to a lesser extent. Luxury real estate in the Hampton\u2019s? A lot. But real estate in Ohio? Not so much, right? Hair-dressing and restaurants, not. So they talk about the Cantillion effect, being close to the money. But there\u2019s an entire array, a vector of coefficients you can calculate, and it\u2019s a function of the construction of the product. Because the construction of a caesar salad next to my table is very labor intensive, capital intensive. The construction of a 30-year bond is something altogether different. So really, the K-shaped recovery we see is: half the world is sitting on top of financial assets that are floating on the pool of liquidity. Are you heavier than water? Or are you lighter than water? You want a simple thing? It\u2019s like, Yeah, I told you there\u2019s a flood coming and everybody\u2019s gonna drown, you\u2019re gonna be under a hundred feet of water \u2014 what would you do? Build an ark, right? So you build something that floats, you have to weigh less than the water. By the way, if I take block of granite or a block of concrete, it\u2019s 30% buoyant, so if it weighs 1,000 pounds, it acts like 700 pounds under the water. If I want to really hold something down underwater I drop lead. Lead\u2019s denser. Maybe that\u2019s the theory: What\u2019s the economic density of any product or service, and how does it respond when you blow liquidity on it? And a chemist would say, well everybody\u2019s got a different coefficient. And the economists want to tell you that everybody\u2019s coefficient is the same. And then they just want to pick everything with a low inflationary coefficient, and they want to put that in their basket and they want to measure it. And the horrific observation I think you\u2019ve made is, if I have the ability to re-balance the market basket, there will never ever be inflation, ever. You know, we had 22% inflation in the bond for a decade before COVID, and the world thought there was no inflation. There\u2019s no inflation if you wanted a pizza, but if you wanted to retire at age 30 and work on your art or your writing or go to school or take care of your family, that inflated 22% a year. The American Dream, I\u2019m using a clich\u00e9, you know, retirement, that was inflating at 22% a year running away from you while the pizza was flat. The bottom line is: No I didn\u2019t write anything. You\u2019re the writer. You are the best writer in the entire industry, Saifedean. Let me say, like, I put the $400 million, the money, into Bitcoin because I kind of went down the rabbit hole and figured it out. But I actually, in a sneaky way, I maneuvered not just to say we were speculating Bitcoin or holding it as an asset or investing in it. I made it a treasury reserve asset, and then I had to\u2014we went through a tender offer where we had to let the investors decide whether they liked that idea or not like that idea. When we bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin we agreed to buy $250 million worth of our stock back. The stock was trading at $120, we tendered at $140. So I\u2019m inverting half the balance sheet, and the other half \u2014 I had $500 million that I didn\u2019t need for working capital. So we took half of it, put it in Bitcoin. The other half, we said, Look if you don\u2019t like this we\u2019ll buy you out at a premium. We waited 20 days. The stock traded above the tender price. We got $60 million tendered to us. I have $175 million extra, and some change. What am I gonna do with that?"}

Because the next thing I\u2019m gonna do is get the board to adopt the fact that, No, we didn\u2019t just agree to buy $250 million worth of Bitcoin, we\u2019re gonna actually implement a treasury policy. The big idea, the Bitcoin Standard, for a corporation\u2014and I think we could be a model \u2014 is: we do business in 25 countries. In Yen in Japan, we have working capital in Japan in Yen, in Won in Korea, in Euros in Europe, in Pesos in Argentina, in Real in Brazil, in Dollars in the US. We were on a Dollar Standard, we had a bunch of USD sitting all around in USD accounts. Our working capital was $50 million a year \u2014 maybe I can convince my CFO we\u2019ll need less, we\u2019ll see, but we have about $50 million in working capital in our operating accounts, we had $700 million worth of other stuff, we started buying our stock back, and then we started thinking about the Bitcoin standard, and the conclusion is: You sell products and services in fiat, you hold operating accounts in the local fiat accounts \u2014 that\u2019s your working capital, you sweep your excess working capital into your treasury, you convert your treasury into Gold, if you\u2019re on the Gold Standard, or Bitcoin, if you\u2019re on the Bitcoin Standard. In the future, should you ever need to purchase property, purchase products or purchase services in excess of your operating accounts, you convert your treasury back into fiat, in the currency you need. If you\u2019re generating cash positive, if you\u2019re making $50 million a year, you just keep sweeping $50 million a year into your treasury. Then you have a choice: Do you buy your own stock, or do you buy Bitcoin? Well, our treasury policy is: We do one or the other subject to market conditions. The outside investors would say, Why don\u2019t you just give us the $500 million back? Well, if I give you the $500 million back I de-capitalize the company, it\u2019s like you giving all your life savings to your favorite charity. Well you\u2019ll feel good for a while, but if you lose your job, your children will starve. And if you care about your children, if you care about your customers, your employees, your counter-parties, your integrity \u2014 I signed a 10-year lease, I\u2019ve never missed a payment in my life. I\u2019ve been CEO for 31 years. I never missed a payroll, I\u2019ve never missed a payment. I look at a customer in the eye, I swear to them, I will maintain the software. That\u2019s a matter of integrity. I do business with governments, banks. Everybody under the sun. They have to trust me. I have to be able to make good on my promises. I can\u2019t de-capitalize the company. So yeah, I\u2019ll buy the stock back from time to time, if it\u2019s mispriced. If someone wants to short my stock, have at it. As long as you have a strong treasury, you\u2019re not afraid of a short seller. What do you do, drive my stock to $20 a share? I buy it all, go private, thank you. Do that."}

He\u2019s a great figure, and he had a near-death experience at Apple. Michael Dell said, Give the money back to the shareholders\u2014the company is dead. Apple almost went bankrupt back in the late 90s. And so, when Apple was successful he started accumulating cash. No dividends, no buybacks, just accumulate cash. And he did it because it was a formative experience, you know, you live through the Depression, you almost starve you accumulate cash, you\u2019re very conservative. I did things that I regret when I was a younger CEO, I borrowed money, my stock got shorted, we spent more than we generated in revenue. At one point we went to within 10 days of being de-listed. I got to within 5 days of bankruptcy and de-listing. My stock went from $333 a share to 42 cents, because I borrowed some money in a convertible preferred security, and the guys that issued the security were shorting my stock as they were hedging their security, and they shorted me, Saifedean, from $100 a share, to 42 cents. So you think you can\u2019t get beat to death? That\u2019s a 99.8% top to bottom fall. And by the way, I\u2019m not blaming the world. I got the flesh flayed off my back. At the time, maybe I felt sorry for myself. Now I look back on it and I realize, You shouldn\u2019t spend more than you generate, and I shouldn\u2019t have borrowed money from someone in a convertible preferred, knowing that they were going to short it against me. And you should be responsible and save your pennies. So, that was 2003. I got conservative and we built up $700 million in cash, but everybody else thought, you\u2019re just crazy. And this is where I thought I was right but I was wrong, and they were right. It\u2019s a moral hazard, right, you point out. They were right because the cost of capital, according to Saifedean, in The Bitcoin Standard, is 7%. The inflation rate on assets is 7%. If I take $700 million and I\u2019m yielding 1% or 2% \u2014 and that\u2019s the best I could do on short-term treasuries \u2014 I\u2019m losing 5% every year on $700 million. So what I should have done, what you should do, is build a company so that you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re gonna generate cash-flow, I know easier said than done, right? Build a company so you know you\u2019re gonna generate cash-flow, and if you\u2019re not sure, you put a certain treasury balance, but you have to invest the treasury balance in something that yields better than cost of capital. Which means: no cash, no short-term government bonds. You might as well put it into the S&P 500. By the way, Saifedean, I wrote a book, The Mobile Wave in 2012, you can go read it. If you Google me you\u2019ll find a 2-minute clip on YouTube no-one watched, 700 people watched, me sitting in my office in 2015 saying, You know Amazon\u2019s gonna de-materialize and destroy 20,000 retail companies. There\u2019s just no reason to buy anything else. Okay, no one cared. I wrote the book, and the theme of the book is: Apple is gonna de-materialize everybody. And Google, Facebook and Amazon are gonna crush everybody. If you bought the stock, you would\u2019ve made 10x-20x your money. It was a very simple thesis: they\u2019d already destroyed everybody. They\u2019re $100 billion networks that are de-materializing stuff, they can print products and services for zero variable cost, and they\u2019re just gonna get stronger and stronger and stronger. The bottom line is, I made $50,000 on the book\u2014you know, you can make $500 million buying the stocks. And the lesson that was taught to me \u2014"}

{"link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/bitcoinpodcasts/sem-sep24", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "text": "Michael Saylor [28:03]: Here\u2019s my thinking on this, and I Tweeted about it today: I mean, all the Bitcoin Cash guys, they\u2019re fanatic about It\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange. Roger Ver has been Tweeting at me, It\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange. My view is, there\u2019s a $250 trillion ocean of assets: stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, derivatives \u2014 no one\u2019s buying a pizza with any of that stuff. No one ever took a share of Apple stock and walked into Starbucks and complained and bitched and moaned about not being able to use Apple stock in order to pay for their Starbucks. You have a house? Try using your house to pay for pizza! What do you think is the transaction velocity on a house? Put it on the market, wait 6 months, get a buyer. \u201cI wanna buy your house.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s 30 days.\u201d It takes 30 days and the transaction fee is 6%. You wanna sell a million dollar house? It\u2019s $60,000 in 30 days from the point that someone swears they wanna buy it. So somebody\u2019s running around in there saying, Well we gotta drive the transaction cost down. We gotta drive the transaction speed up. You need to be able to move the asset from point to point, peer to peer, as a settlement network. You need that. You need that for freedom. It\u2019s like I say to you: Saifedean, you can go anywhere in the world, you\u2019re free. That doesn\u2019t mean you should go to a different place every day. Now, having the freedom is not the same as using the freedom. Just because you can do a thing, doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing\u2014Stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius, 2,000 years ago, or whoever else did it. So, I look at this and I think, it\u2019s nice, but you should sell your products and services in fiat, and you should sell your property in fiat. You should buy your property, your products and services in fiat, and the Yen, the Won, the Euro, the whatever, because that\u2019s the way that 99.99% of the people do it. You should sweep the excess monetary energy into your treasury, and you should convert it to Bitcoin. So, just one last point on this, and you\u2019ll get it: the Parable of the Lions. A bunch of lions are chasing after a bunch of antelope. There are some lazy lions, they can\u2019t catch the antelope. They complain to the zookeeper on the game reserve, \u201cThe antelope are running around too fast. It\u2019s too hard for us, we can\u2019t catch them. Slow them down.\u201d The zookeeper solves the problem by hobbling the antelope. The lazy lions catch the antelope. The lions eat the antelopes. The antelopes all die. Then the lions all die. The zookeeper blames it on the weather, and gets another job. That\u2019s the story of transaction fees and transaction rates on a crypto network. That\u2019s why the Ethereum, the Bitcoin Cash, all the other forks. You know this, you\u2019re the one who told me: it\u2019s a billion times more expensive to do it on a proof of work network, or a trillion times? When it gets to be a billion times more expensive, that\u2019s enough, right? It\u2019s a billion times more expensive to do transactions on the network. The reason that you want crypto is you want sovereign immortality. I want to put $100 million on the network, and I want it to last for 100 years, and on the other end I want it to come out $100 million, even though half the governments failed, and everybody debased and destroyed everything. I want to put it in and I want it to transcend time and domain, time and space. By the way, that\u2019s a pretty good application for putting $250 trillion worth of stuff. But it doesn\u2019t have to move fast. I do think there are some interesting things that our business will look at in Bitcoin: we\u2019re standing up a full node, and we\u2019re looking at the data coming off of Bitcoin, and we\u2019re looking to see if we can\u2019t thread the data sets and information from Bitcoin into our intelligence offerings, in order to provide that. But I don\u2019t feel the need to buy anything in Bitcoin or sell anything in Bitcoin, and it\u2019s a billion times less efficient to do it that way. So, why do people get wrapped around the axle with the medium of exchange, they\u2019re trying so hard. Only 1%, you know a typical rich person, a wealthy person, spends 2% of the wealth every year. 98% of their wealth just sits there. The richest man in the world, I guess it\u2019s Jeff Bezos, is rich because of a bunch of assets including Amazon stock, that\u2019s hardly moving ever. And by the way, if you have any wealth, the thing that doesn\u2019t get said is, it\u2019s so tax inefficient to sell it, and guys in New York realize this \u2014 there are families in New York City, they own a city block, they\u2019ve owned it for a hundred years, they have real estate on it. They never sell it. You just refinance it every year, they\u2019ve never made any money, Saifedean. I have $100 million worth of an asset: it\u2019s going up 7% a year because the asset inflation rate on real estate in Manhattan is going up, probably more than 7% a year, right? Every 10 years I refinance it, I borrow some more money, it\u2019s tax free, I live off of tax-free debt, a hundred years later, the family\u2019s got $1 billion worth of real estate, $700 million worth of debt, they\u2019re paying 0% interest on the debt, they\u2019ve never made any income their entire life. Why would you ever generate operating income that\u2019s taxable? Everybody\u2019s just gonna borrow against their assets as their assets inflate. You know, I can borrow money from a bank, at LIBOR, I can borrow money for a yacht at LIBOR plus 200 basis points, Saifedean. And LIBOR is like, what? What\u2019s LIBOR? I can borrow money against a liquid asset like a stock, at LIBOR plus 50 basis points. Why would you ever sell anything? And so this idea of moving around Bitcoin, it\u2019s like taking the billion-times-harder way around the field. I gotta run around the field a billion times to score one run."}

The way that I was thinking about it was, if you were going to be using it, you won\u2019t be using it on-chain. As I think you Tweeted about it a few days ago, what was it, 99.8% of Bitcoin transactions would happen off-chain. This is something that people miss when they talk about scaling, because whatever asset you\u2019re talking about whether it\u2019s another digital currency or a physical gold or a government money, you\u2019re not gonna perform final settlement with every cup of coffee. It\u2019s just not gonna happen. The final settlement is gonna come at a much slower rate than the transactions, and the day-to-day transactions are going to happen between people who are within networks that you have repeated business with one another so that if your credit card bounces at the coffee shop they\u2019ll know you the next day and they\u2019ll tell you Hey get a new credit card or stop doing this. Their bank will contact your bank or their credit card company will take away your credit card. There are these mechanisms for the smaller payments, and that\u2019s how Bitcoin scales. People misconstrue the Bitcoin network as a payments network and they compare it against VISA or Mastercard on top of Bitcoin and Bitcoin will be the final settlement asset, but it will be much better and faster final settlement than you would get with national currencies."}

You know, let\u2019s take Jeff Bezos again: doesn\u2019t he have like $200 billion worth of Amazon stock? He\u2019s got $200 billion, and that\u2019s worth all that Bitcoin is\u2014the entire Bitcoin network is $200 billion. How many transactions do you think Jeff Bezos has done to sell his Amazon stock in his life? I\u2019d be willing to bet you, he picks up the phone once a quarter\u2014about ten times. He\u2019s probably picked up the phone about ten times, and he said to one guy, Uh, well why don\u2019t you sell a million shares of Amazon for me? Click. And he put the phone down. Maybe he did a hundred transactions, okay? He\u2019s just fine. That\u2019s the way it works. You\u2019re gonna sweep your excess capital into a working capital account, and it\u2019s gonna be on Square or PayPal or ApplePay, or in some random bank. By the way, I don\u2019t trust my bank in Argentina for a hundred years. I mean, I had it fail ten years ago. I lost $1 million in Argentina. One day it was in dollars in Bank of America. The next day by edict it was in Pesos at 1:1 in Bank of America. The next day it was devalued to 10:1 in the same bank, and I got back $100,000 and I started with $1 million, and it was gone. The only two places in the world I ever lost money in a bank was Brazil and Argentina. You don\u2019t forget those things. Having said that, I do business with banks in Brazil and Argentina today. I don\u2019t trust them for a hundred years \u2014 you gotta trust them for a hundred days. And so, you just put the amount of money into the banks that you can afford to lose."}

And life is too short, Saifedean, to try to convince a fanatic to change their mind. The world\u2019s got 7 billion people in it, and if you go on my Twitter and you\u2019re rude, or uncivil, or a jerk, block, block, block. I\u2019m not gonna \u2014 I\u2019ll take one second, but you don\u2019t get to hang out. But to your point, you said, electronic cash in a classical format, so that I\u2019m making cash delivery in settlement, this is back to the Stoic issue: you need the ability to have peer to peer payments in order to have freedom and sovereignty. You need the ability. Just because I have the ability to move $1 or $1 million or $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, I have the ability to send it to anybody anytime, and it\u2019s gonna cost me a few bucks, and 30 minutes. Just because you can do a thing, doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing. The fact that you have the ability to do it 1 out of 100,000 times, means that it\u2019s a harder form of currency, and a better money than anything else. There\u2019s a phrase: a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. People get wrapped around the axle of doing a literal interpretation. They\u2019re like, Well that\u2019s not what Satoshi said. Here\u2019s where Nicholas Taleb has a good insight here: A semantic representation of a sophisticated idea may not be adequate. If you come into my restaurant and you ask me what\u2019s on the menu and I say \u201cCold, dead fish,\u201d you might be horrified by that. If I said it to you in Japanese you wouldn\u2019t even know without translating it. If I wrote a book on it, you might understand it better. If I just put it in front of your face, you might think it\u2019s pretty good sushi. Just because the words don\u2019t resonate doesn\u2019t mean the thing isn\u2019t a good thing. So, it\u2019s a 9-page whitepaper, and if you interpret it through a certain lens, you understand \u2014 by the way, it doesn\u2019t even matter if he understood what he was saying or not. It\u2019s putting a lot of weight on one dude or a group of guys 10 years ago to extrapolate how the world was going to evolve later. So I think they had a vision, and the vision works well as a settlement network, and for people who are clinging to an orthodox interpretation of that vision 10 years later, they choose to imbue those semantic representation with their ideology, and it\u2019s crippling to the future of Bitcoin because they wanna do something \u2014 I want to make one more point: if I move $1 from point A to point B, versus $1 billion from point A to point B, isn\u2019t it obvious on its surface that the value in use of moving $1 is a billion times less than the value of moving $1 billion? So they\u2019re chasing the long tail down to something which is exponentially less valuable, and they\u2019re making it a priority on a network, and that\u2019s long-tail foolishness."}
{"link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/bitcoinpodcasts/sem-sep24", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [44:36]: Yeah and absolutely, Nakamoto doesn\u2019t have an ownership over Bitcoin, he can\u2019t force people to use it in a certain way and I think the history of science and technology is full of all of these inventions that ended up used in ways where the original inventor didn\u2019t forsee. The Wright brothers, after inventing the airplane, they said, one of them, I can\u2019t remember which, he said, It\u2019s impossible that an airplane will ever cross the Atlantic. And so, what, do we ban flights across the Atlantic because the Wright brothers said it can\u2019t happen? Viagra was meant to be a heart drug. Do we ban it now for other uses because the original vision of the founder was \u201cthis\u201d? You know, technology finds its way based on what people want and not on what inventors say and think, and I think that\u2019s completely midguided. One question I wanted to ask you is a topic that I will focus on in my next book The Fiat Standard. In that book I\u2019m trying to do to fiat money what I did to Bitcoin. When I wrote the Bitcoin Standard the idea was, How do I get this to an intelligent reader with no background? How do I explain to them how this Bitcoin thing works and why it matters? And do it for someone who has zero background as to how this monster works? And I think that kind of framework would be more useful to apply to fiat money because fiat money is a hundred times more complicated than Bitcoin, and I think a lot of people could benefit from trying to understand that. And so, as I started to think about fiat money as an engineer, trying to explain how it functions in the same way that I did with Bitcoin, one mechanism of understanding how it works is that, under a gold standard, if you find a way of making more gold in the world, you\u2019re going to take advantage of it, you\u2019re going to start digging up the gold and selling it because that costs you less than what the price of gold is on the market. Similarly on a Bitcoin standard people are trying to mine more Bitcoin. But on a fiat standard, everybody is trying to mine fiat, and the way that it works on a fiat standard is, you mine fiat by issuing debt, so you can mine it by printing pieces of paper, but that\u2019s really the old fiat standard. Today, the vast majority of money is not pieces of paper, it\u2019s debt that\u2019s issued by banks. Everytime a new financial institution makes a new loan, new fiat money is created."}

I think the metaphor of a bank as a fiat miner is the most brilliant, breakthrough metaphor. I read that in your paper last night, I was up late reading it, and I got to whatever, page 30 and you got to some point where you said banks are in essence mining fiat and I thought, Oh my god, that is just the most \u2014 like, no one has ever said that before! But, once you get that idea you\u2019re like, Now I know why I wanna run a bank, and now I realize why the world is so screwed up because they\u2019re out of control. So keep going, but I just wanted to say, I think it\u2019s unique, seminal, brilliant, I\u2019ve never heard anybody ever express it that, but it explains so much once you have that metaphor in your head."}
{"link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/bitcoinpodcasts/sem-sep24", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [47:59]: Yeah, it\u2019s why everybody is in debt, because every time you get into debt, you\u2019re allowing somebody else to mine fiat, effectively. So if you want to buy a house for $1 million with cash\u2014that\u2019s one thing, but then if you take the cash from a bank, well the bank gets to create $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 of new fiat out of this process. So, they\u2019re gonna give you a better deal on it than if you buy it with cash, and that\u2019s why you get into debt for your house and for your business, and for everything. You know, individuals and corporations and governments\u2014everybody is up to their eyeballs in debt because getting into debt is mining fiat. So I think this might be the most vivid way in which Bitcoin fixes the world, this might be the most powerful way, because this allows us to monetize something other than debt. We don\u2019t need to keep mining debt in order to have money, we can start mining a hard asset that has no counter-party liability, and that is much more solid, whereas, you can build a financial system on it because you know that the value of this Bitcoin is not dependent on counter-parties making this financial obligation. But currently, the choice that you would\u2019ve faced with your reserves before Bitcoin was, you had to put them either in cash and watch them get robbed of purchasing power every year, or you had to put them in debt and then take on the counter-party risk of the governments or the agencies or all the bonds that you\u2019re using, and primarily it\u2019s government treasuries that people use the most. The interesting thing to think about is that if Bitcoin leads to a reduction in the demand for debt, a reduction in the demand for treasuries\u2014because people like you are using Bitcoin as a reserve asset rather than holding bonds, then I think there\u2019s another factor that goes in, because Bitcoin is, (a) it\u2019s leading to a reduction in the demand for dollars, but (b) it\u2019s also leading to a reduction in the supply of newly mined fiat dollars because it\u2019s reducing the demand for debt. Or at least if it increases significantly, you know \u2014 we\u2019re gonna see a hundred Microstrategy(s), that means less demand for government bonds. So in a sense it kind of cancels each-other out: Bitcoin is not just taking the demand away from the dollar\u2014it\u2019s taking the demand away from the dollar and reducing the supply of the dollar, which I think is an optimistic way of saying we don\u2019t have to have hyperinflation. We can witness this thing continue, whereby, the supply of the dollar declines and the demand for the dollar declines while the value of Bitcoin rises and the demand for Bitcoin rises."}
{"link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/bitcoinpodcasts/sem-sep24", "title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "text": "Michael Saylor: I think that this is one of the reasons why Bitcoin should be positioned as an asset \u2014 a crypto-asset \u2014 and not as a currency, because you have multiple monetary systems: you\u2019ve got the fiat monetary system\u2014and as we\u2019ve said, if you put $100 million into fiat, you\u2019re gonna lose 99% of your money over a hundred years. And then you\u2019ve got a gold monetary system: you put $100 million in gold, you\u2019re gonna lose 80% or 85% or 90% of your position over a hundred years, because it\u2019s inflating, and it\u2019s got counter-party risk. And then you\u2019ve got a stock monetary system: you\u2019ve got like an equity monetary system \u2014 that people are worshiping at the altar of NASDAQ right now. And they\u2019re basically floating into Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, because they think that these are indestructible utilities that\u2019ll go on forever. So you put it into those, and I think you\u2019re gonna lose value because at some point they\u2019re gonna get regulated and they\u2019re gonna actually get chopped into pieces by well-meaning politicians. One way or the other. But that system has captured all the value, right? All of the wealth on Wall Street has surged: first it moved into bonds and then it moved out of bonds into the equity markets over the past 3\u20134 months. The only way you stay in bonds \u2014 by the way, there\u2019s a bond monetary system. If the interest rates are gonna keep going down, the bonds will keep going up, so you put your store of value into bonds. And the only way that keeps working now is interest rates have to go negative. If interest rates don\u2019t go negative, the bond monetary system stops working for the wealth of the world, so they go to equity. And that\u2019s why the Big Tech is a crowded trade, and why the NASDAQ has gone to all-time highs\u2014and the S&P. Now, at some point that stops working, because the P/Es blow out and you\u2019re valuing Apple at 3x \u2014 you\u2019ve got companies that are a hundred times revenue that are trading on NASDAQ now. So at some point that de-laminates, and now, what you really wanna do is position Bitcoin as another digital asset, and then you have all the people with their money in Apple, in Amazon, in Facebook, in Google, surging into Bitcoin as the store of value, right? There\u2019s a good story\u2014this is why you don\u2019t want to curry the narrative of: well this is for privacy and fighting the government and escaping regulations and censorship and off-chain and \u201cWe hate Wall Street, We hate institutions, We hate institutional custodians\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re basically going down that narrative, you\u2019re inviting every government to outlaw you. And the number one issue, Saifedean, of\u2014can we have a peaceful transition from a debt economy to a Bitcoin economy \u2014 is: are they gonna outlaw Bitcoin? Okay? If they think that Bitcoin is Apple stock, the answer is no. If Bitcoin is Apple or Bitcoin is Google or Bitcoin is Amazon, they\u2019ll bounce it around a bit but no one is walking around saying We need to pass a law to stop you from owning Apple stock. On the other hand, when you start talking about, I wanna do things to evade regulators and the like, it\u2019s like in Russia they said you can\u2019t use it as a currency, you can use it as an asset, that was the law. What you wanna do is you wanna position Bitcoin as an asset, and then people will just sit around and say, Am I gonna put my money in real estate or gold or silver or Bitcoin or Apple stock? And then it\u2019s kind of an easy decision, isn\u2019t it? I mean, as soon as you know it\u2019s not gonna blow up and fail\u2014if Bitcoin was a company, or whatever, I think you\u2019d see a surge. And for us to see a peaceful transition, we need to not have a situation like in Venezuela or a Zimbabwe where they pass a law and they say, You can\u2019t have it. You don\u2019t wanna go back to\u2014you saw with the 1934 Gold Act, right? You don\u2019t want the government to seize your gold, and you don\u2019t want them to seize your Bitcoin. [54:54] And so, to the extent that they just view it as another asset that people choose to hold and is non-threatening, I think that you\u2019ll see a migration to it. To the extent that they see it as trying to replace the US Dollar, then it becomes a different thing. So, that\u2019s what I think on that."}

What do you think of the idea that Bitcoin can potentially be the final \u2014 be the way that we get rid of QE? Right now all Wall Street companies, they constantly face liquidity problems whenever there\u2019s any kind of problem in the market and then that requires an endless amount of liquidity intervention. But if they had a proper cash reserve on their balance sheet, they wouldn\u2019t care about these liquidity problems, you know? Bitcoin would hold its value and it would appreciate now and then."}

I agree with that. I think that, as it gets stronger, the number one benefit of it is it keeps everybody else honest. Right? It spreads, it keeps people honest. If the government \u2014 let\u2019s take Argentina \u2014 if the government of Argentina knew that every wealthy Argentinian, everybody in Argentina had their treasury in Bitcoin, they would think twice before they print kazillion amounts of additional currency, right? It will create a discipline, because the citizenry has some power, the citizenry can choose not to participate. So as it spreads I think it will create rationale. I think, if you have no alternative\u2014in the absence of an alternative \u2014 I think the politicians start to overreach."}

Yeah, I used to live in Lebanon up until very recently, and if you\u2019ve heard the news, Lebanon\u2019s banking system is in tatters now and the currency\u2019s been destroyed, and after I left, I realized that banks were giving insanely high interest rates to people on their savings accounts, and for me the amazing thing about Bitcoin is that all of those years I\u2019d lived in Lebanon and I never borrowed a cent or lent a cent to my bank, basically. My paycheck comes into my bank, and I use it just for day to day transactions and then never had to worry about what\u2019s going to happen with the Lebanese government and their solvency and all of the bonds and all of that stuff. And it\u2019s amazing to think that if in 20 years time, everybody else in countries like Lebanon and Argentina had that option, then there\u2019s very very little scope or room for the government to rob people. The peace of mind that comes to me from the fact that, no matter what happens in all of the world\u2019s banks, and all of the world\u2019s central banks, and all of the world\u2019s governments, they\u2019ll never be able to destroy more than a small part of my wealth which I happen to keep in any particular bank at any particularly point in time. And this is just amazing, you know? It\u2019s a one-time solution to make sure that you will never be Lebanon\u2019ed, you will never get the Argentina Special, you will never get that inflation. It\u2019s amazing. And I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before more and more people figure out this solution."}

While I\u2019m sitting, for days at a time, and I\u2019m trading and I\u2019m buying this Bitcoin, and I watch \u201cmoney\u201d\u2014$500,000 of cash \u2014 become, whatever, 50 Bitcoin, and I\u2019m watching these kind of things happen, I had this epiphany that the destiny of money is to be encrypted. Every time I did the trade I thought, I just took $500,000 of cash \u2014 that someone can burn and steal \u2014 and I put it into a vault of encrypted energy, and now they can\u2019t get at it, and I just had this massive dopamine hit, that this felt so good to encrypt my money. The destiny of money is to be encrypted \u2014 in Bitcoin\u2014not any encryption. The second observation is, I just think your book is brilliant, and your work is brilliant, and you should publish again. I\u2019m in favor of it, let me know if I can help. And that my third observation is, if you do call it The Fiat Standard, I\u2019m not converting all of my money to fiat."}
