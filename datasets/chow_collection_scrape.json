And I think the right place to jump in here today \u2014 since we\u2019re taking the big picture approach \u2014 is to just answer the question, what is money?"}
{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-10-the-death-of-gold-554ddfbea012?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 10 | The Death of Gold", "text": "Michael Saylor 1:49\nYou know, I never in my life had anybody asked me that question before you asked it to me the first time for our first series? And when you asked me that question, that catalyzed the whole set of thinking. And it got me thinking: money is energy. And of course we did the nine-part series and we spent a lot of time talking about energy systems and engineering as a discipline of manipulating energy and why it was critical to the human race and the human condition. And so we won\u2019t re-cover any of that, because that\u2019s well-trod territory. But coming back to the question of what is money and just focusing on it, I would say, for our round two or part two of this series, I\u2019d say: money is tokenized energy within a socio-political framework. So we know money is energy. But tokenized energy \u2014 that is: a dollar is a measure of energy, a gold coin is a measure of energy, a bale of tobacco that you\u2019re trading is a token of energy. And how much energy? Well, that\u2019s where the socio-political framework comes in. You can you can measure actual physical or engineering energy and its objective, but money ends up being to a certain degree subjective because if I show up on a deserted island and I\u2019ve got a stack of gold coins and everybody has guns, and they\u2019re shooting each other, they might not accept my gold coin. Whereas if I actually offer the bullets for their gun, they might think the bullets are actually better money than the gold coin, just like cigarettes are good money and in a POW camp, but gold coins wouldn\u2019t be. So this question of what is money gets you really going. So if money is tokenized energy within a social-political framework, then we can look over the history of mankind and we realize that we\u2019ve chosen many different ways to tokenize that energy, and we\u2019ll skip through most of them because they came and they went, but there are three that popped to mind that are interesting. One is the gold standard. The second is the fiat standard. And the third is the Bitcoin standard. And when you start asking what is money, you start asking, well, what\u2019s the best monetary system? And we\u2019ve got these three systems to talk about. I think one thing that\u2019s pretty clear is that most people can\u2019t get their heads around Bitcoin because it\u2019s an utter paradigm shift. And why is it a paradigm shift? Well, because I think Bitcoin is the first digital money. It\u2019s the first digital money. Gold wasn\u2019t digital money and fiat is not digital money, either. And so economists and politicians and investors, they all lack the right mental model to understand Bitcoin because science and engineering were so intrinsic to gold that we took it for granted, because gold is a 10-pound lump of something and if you if you get slugged in the head with it, nobody had to explain that science and physics mattered. And then science and engineering kind of became like quasi-irrelevant in the fiat world. Everybody just kind of ignored science and engineering and there were no immediate clear consequences. There were just the hyperinflations and the collapses of those fiat systems. But because they abandoned gold and there was no digital money, the only alternative to one fiat, you know, the Weimar Republic fiat currency, was the [British] Pound. And that alternative was an alternative to the next thing and the next thing. So we\u2019re comparing fiat currencies or fiat monies to each other. And so there was no real need to embrace science and engineering. And Bitcoin is this paradigm shift where we have digital money crashing into, I guess what we\u2019ll call analog money, or maybe a political money is a better way to describe it. And now we start to ask the question again, what is money? And I think tokenized energy isn\u2019t good enough to explain what is money. Another way to describe money is by coming back to the ideal model. What is the ideal model of money? Ideal money is a shared, immutable, correct ledger. You know, you\u2019ve heard the phrase, Bitcoin is a shared immutable ledger and people debate about whether it\u2019s truly immutable or not, but a crypto-asset network, fully decentralized and mature, is the closest thing we can get to an immutable shared ledger in the history of the world. I think a lot of times when people describe it as a shared immutable ledger, they leave off the correct or the mathematically correct, because it\u2019s almost implied. But I think that if you were to focus upon the three critical dimensions of ideal money, you would say: (1) it\u2019s a ledger that\u2019s shared, everybody in the political system has to have the same access to the ledger. (2) It has to be immutable, no one can doctor it. But it has to be (3) correct, mathematically complete or mathematically proper, because if it\u2019s incomplete or incorrect, then it\u2019s not ideal money. So if I take that as a model, money is a shared immutable, correct ledger, then I can imagine the perfect money would be: some godlike being comes down on earth and they create this perfect uncorruptible system and they telepathically drop that shared immutable correct ledger into the heads of every human being. And every time you incur a debt, it updates the ledger and when you incur a credit, it updates the ledger. And no one can corrupt the ledger."}

Can I enter a building? Can I exit? Can I cross a border? What are my rights? And what are my obligations? And what do I own? And what do I share, and it all comes down to just a shared database, but that database needs to be immutable and correct. And that is property, the essence of property. And I suppose, when you own a piece of property, and you buy it \u2014 a piece of land five acres somewhere, then there\u2019s a deed and you go and you file the deed with the courthouse. And that\u2019s kind of critical, right. And so much of property law revolves around making sure that there are no liens on the property before I buy it, making sure that you have the proper title to it. And that you can transfer that title. And I think that money, to your point, it\u2019s kind of like the apex property, it\u2019s the sum of all property or at least it\u2019s the most important property, I suppose, because it would be the property that I could use to trade for any other property. Any other property or any other product or service. So that is my tokenized energy."}

Is that money because the most important person in the village said it\u2019s money? Or is that money because the best engineer offered it as money? Satoshi engineered money. Whereas, every government has created money. So if we start with that model, right: shared immutable correct [money]. And now we go back to all the monetary systems in history. Start with ancient coins, right? Coin networks, well there have been so many coin networks starting with the Lydians. Each coin network is: well I have a gold coin, I have a silver coin, I have a copper coin, oftentimes, there\u2019s three different coins, you know, one for 1,000, one for 10, one for 1, they have to be at three different scales. And the shortcoming is you create a system of coinage or custom tokens, and then you start shuffling them around in a network, you can only trade to the extent that you have those tokens. And if people lose the tokens the money is gone. But then people try to counterfeit the tokens, they try to cut the coins different ways. Eventually the coins might wear down, the coins have to be carried. And so why do all these coin systems fail? I guess on one hand, there\u2019s never enough of them. There\u2019s always a limit. On the other hand, they\u2019re discrete. So you can go from 1000 to 100 to a 10, or from 1000 to a 10 to a 1 but how do you get to a 0.1 or 0.01 when you want to get to orders of magnitude more or you want to make change in the middle. You end up with all these money changers, and the result of the money changing is a huge amount of friction or impedance. And for thousands of years, people couldn\u2019t figure out how to manufacture coins that couldn\u2019t be cut or counterfeited or that were durable and so ultimately, every single mercantile system has its own internal coin system. And when you swap from one system to the second, there\u2019s this money changer in the middle and they take you for 10%. I remember traveling from London to Rome back before the EU was formed, Robert, and I showed up with dollars, and I converted my dollars into pounds. And then I think I took a plane to the Netherlands and I converted my pounds to whatever the Dutch currency was. And I went to Belgium and I converted the Dutch currency to the Belgian currency. And then we went through France, I converted it again. And then we went to Italy and I converted again, I ended up with like 50% of what I started with after about 72 hours!"}

So there\u2019s this problem we\u2019ve always had, transforming one form of energy into another and back."}
{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-10-the-death-of-gold-554ddfbea012?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 10 | The Death of Gold", "text": "Michael Saylor [16:19]: Crossing a coin network is: every single time you cross the network, there\u2019s energy loss. And then there\u2019s loss over time as people counterfeit the coins, and you can\u2019t tell. And then there\u2019s losses as the coins get debased. And so the result is what, like 5,000 different systems of coinage over time. And every one of them struggled. Ultimately, they were the basis of the gold standard. And we have this myth that there was a gold standard, the good old days, but it seems like the gold standard never worked as far as we can find anywhere. I mean, we have the stories of the Romans debasing their coinage and the collapse of the Roman Empire. And we know the Lydians eventually lost theirs. And we know there must have been hundreds of systems of coinage in Greece, and one city would sack another city and melt down their coins and create the next set of coins. So I mean there\u2019s a problem with the whole idea of coinage. And the problem with coinage is it\u2019s based on metal \u2014 metallic money. And of course, the highest form of money is the gold. So let\u2019s say it\u2019s called the gold standard. But what\u2019s the problem with the gold standard? I mean it never worked that well, because it\u2019s got some crippling flaws, and just some nagging flaws. There\u2019s inflation. Inflation is a nagging defect, it doesn\u2019t inflate fast, it inflates slow, but it inflates at 2% or 3% a year. And because it\u2019s inflating, because you\u2019re mining more gold, and you\u2019re striking more coins or whatever it is you\u2019re moving around, it\u2019s not conservative. And by that I mean it\u2019s not mathematically conservative, or it\u2019s not conservative from a scientific point of view. You start with 100 units, and then you\u2019ve got 102 units, and then 105 units, and 108 units. So whatever percentage of the gold supply you have is leaking at 2% to 3% a year. And it could be worse if it\u2019s not a closed system. So if anybody introduces new gold into the system like when the Spaniards found the Inca gold and they brought back the gold from the New World, you get a massive inflation. I think I remember reading a history of Caesar where when he came back after the Gallic Wars, he had seized so much gold that that created a hyperinflation in Rome and the interest rates leaped. And there was just too much money. And so, either there is inflation because you seized gold or another nation flooded your market with gold, or there\u2019s inflation because the gold mining process continues. And so against our ideal model of money, that means that gold\u2019s not mathematically correct. It\u2019s not conservative, nor is it correct. It\u2019s an approximation. Under the best of circumstances, it\u2019s got a 2% error a year and so over the course of a decade, the best of circumstances is like a 20%, 25% error rate. But the worst of circumstances is: I double or triple the amount of gold when I come back from sacking the Aztecs or the Incas, or I sacked Gaul and I just brought back all this gold and so then you\u2019ve just got a massive error. So gold is mathematically erroneous because you\u2019re just shuffling metallic tokens and it\u2019s not a closed system. The second problem with gold is confiscation because it\u2019s physical. The custodial rights of gold aren\u2019t really \u2014 they\u2019re not great. I guess they\u2019re a little bit better than fiat currency. But in some ways they\u2019re not as good. If I have a lot of gold, if I have a million dollars worth of gold or $10 million worth of gold, it\u2019s heavy \u2014 really heavy. I can\u2019t get it through an airport. I don\u2019t even know like \u2014 you know I tried to \u2014 I went online on Amazon once a few years ago and I wanted a little pocket knife. And I ordered this pocket knife \u2014 you know how pretty much you can only carry a blade, which is like, I don\u2019t know, half an inch long or what\u2019s the number? It\u2019s like some infinitesimally small sized blade, like a quarter inch or a half an inch blade. So I went on Amazon and I found someone advertising this really super small, dinky little knife that you could use to cut a string with. And it was advertised as being a TSA friendly, compliant little pocket knife. And I was so proud of myself, because I must have paid like $39 for it. And then I took it to the airport to go through the metal detector. And I swear that the TSA agent stopped \u2014 you know, I put all this stuff through, they stopped the luggage and said like, Show me that. And they pulled out this little half inch blade to slice a string with, like, Sir, you can\u2019t take this with you. And of course the defense of: Amazon said it\u2019s okay didn\u2019t really fly. Right? And the point of the story is, you can\u2019t even slip a needle-like metal blade through an airport. I wonder if you could carry five gold coins and get away with it? Or ten gold coins, if you can\u2019t get my little pen knife thing through? And so the answer is: it\u2019s easy to confiscate [gold coins], custodial rights are really weak. The fundamental problem with the gold standard is, the custody is difficult and the security is hyper-expensive. And by hyper-expensive, it\u2019s \u2014 how much does it cost to secure a billion dollars worth of this stuff? Like you hire 24 armed guards and you have a vault in Fort Knox?"}

And the security cost scales in some ways exponentially with the amount you have. And also with the number of nodes. If I have 100,000 nodes, I have 100,000 points of failure. And so it scales with the number of nodes, the value of the nodes and the velocity of the nodes, or the velocity of the money, right? If I wanted to move a billion dollars of gold every day of the week, for 365 days in a row, 1,000 miles. Figure out the security cost of that, right? The conclusion is, this money is so heavy it has no velocity. It goes into Fort Knox, it sits there for 30 years, and nobody audits it. And under that circumstance you can almost delude yourself into saying it\u2019s secure. But it\u2019s only secure because there\u2019s no money velocity and there\u2019s no distribution. If I wanted to give gold to 8 billion people and wanted to move it every day, then the cost of the security would go up to consume all of the energy that humanity produces, right? Probably the cost of security for 8 billion people moving gold every day is more than the sum of the entire gross national product of the world. So the security cost doesn\u2019t work \u2014 doesn\u2019t scale."}

So gold is functioning as an asset but it\u2019s not useful as a currency, something that circulates. Therefore, we introduce a currency. And the other thing on gold, I guess it\u2019s the best approximation of that immutable ledger that you described as ideal money. But it has still has this error rate for both inflation, which is relatively small, but the bigger error rate has to do with the violence and confiscation risk, that it\u2019s unpredictable when the market is going to be flooded, or if you\u2019re going to be confiscated, or if your custodian is trustworthy, etc."}

It\u2019s tokenized energy. And it was the best idea for tokenizing energy in the Bronze Age, I suppose. But it\u2019s not a [mathematically] correct token. And because it\u2019s so easy to confiscate, it\u2019s not really a shared ledger anymore. It\u2019s not shared tokens, right? I can\u2019t share it because I can\u2019t carry it with me. And then that leads us to the third problem with it, which is the hypothecation. It\u2019s too easy to counterfeit and manipulate. And it\u2019s easy to counterfeit because I can either debase the coins themselves, or I can lie about the asset in the vault while I give you a gold note. I either create the gold note and I lie about it or I just debase the coin, and that creates a problem of authenticity. And that leads us to the fourth problem, which is authentication. It\u2019s too expensive to audit and authenticate. In fact, out of everybody that I know, I don\u2019t know a single person that\u2019s ever authenticated a gold coin. You wouldn\u2019t know! Coinage was an attempt to make authentication self-evident. Right? And Isaac Newton worked on how do you create a good coin, and most coins were crappy, but we still struggle with this issue. And so if you can\u2019t authenticate it, then that really undermines the \u201cshared\u201d part of the shared ledger as well, and maybe the correct part. And so transportation is also a defect. It\u2019s too expensive and slow and difficult and dangerous to move. And distribution\u2019s a defect because it\u2019s difficult to move, difficult to authenticate and easy to confiscate. Then that means: how do you distribute it? It\u2019s too difficult to distribute, and too expensive to distribute. And when I talk about distribute I mean, how do I give it to a billion people? Right? I mean, practically speaking, if you distribute up to $1,000 of gold coins to a billion people today, there would be a 35% markup/markdown every time it trades, right? You pay $90 for $60 worth of gold. If you have $60 worth of gold, you\u2019d be lucky to sell it for $40. And so that transfer cost is obscene. And then finally, you\u2019ve got this division issue. How do you divide a one ounce gold coin? You can\u2019t. And so I can\u2019t divide it. So I have to create silver coin and copper coin. And now I never have the right combination of change. So prices don\u2019t work quite right. So gold has \u2014 fundamentally, it\u2019s the best tokenized energy in the Bronze Age. But because of all of these defects, by the Middle Ages it was clear it was going to be replaced with some some type of fiat or some kind of checking system or other paper ledger system. It\u2019s not clear to me that they didn\u2019t replace it \u2014 I talked about the gold myth \u2014 it\u2019s not clear to me they didn\u2019t replace the 2,000 years ago. Like they talk about the Sumerian tablets, right, and the Sumerian tablets of clay \u2014 they have ledgers on them. So, isn\u2019t it quite possible, if not likely, that we had checking systems or ledger systems that were privately enforced by banks thousands and thousands of years ago. So the gold myth is: there never was a gold standard. There was never a time when all money was gold. What you had was a time when the principal asset for a store of value over the long duration was gold. And it\u2019s quite likely that you always had \u2014 you know, the merchant had their ledger and you would have credit with the merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the ancient Roman merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the town. Or maybe that was a credit \u2014 if you were on a ship, anybody that\u2019s ever been on a ship sailing for months at a time, the quartermaster has all the supplies. And if you wanted some of those cigarettes or some of that alcohol, they might let you sign it out, but then they charge your account. And when the voyage is over, they debit it against your wages. And so this has been going on for as long as people have been sailing ships around. What we have is the myth of the gold standard, but we\u2019ve always had an asset currency system, and the currency was a checking system with a central counter-party \u2014 we can call them banks today. But we had goldsmiths that had gold notes back in the Middle Ages. And I think you\u2019ve always had merchants, and you\u2019ve always had quartermasters. And you\u2019ve always had the guy in the army that said, You lose it, we\u2019re going to dock your wages for that, whatever it is you lost or you spent or you consumed."}

But it can only be used for large transactions, essentially, because the economics don\u2019t make sense to use it for small transactions. So it doesn\u2019t circulate well but you can settle large transactions with it. So due to that technological limitation of gold \u2014 effectively it had such a high value to weight [ratio], I guess you might say \u2014 that we needed these cheaper systems, these credit systems or derivative systems \u2014 systems of deferred settlement built up around it. And that has been kind of the problem throughout history, because we have this system for final settlement, but we build systems of deferred settlement around it, which are economically more efficient. But they introduce all of this need to trust counter-parties, which comes with counter-party risk which blows up time and time again."}

The implication is city-state, because I have to get my credit from the local merchant. So if the local merchant is 1,000 miles away, the credit system doesn\u2019t work. It breaks down. So I think you can create a trust network that goes about 10 miles or 20 miles \u2014 a trust network out to the suburbs. And then once you get beyond the suburbs, the trust breaks down. And if the trust breaks down, that means you\u2019ve got Renaissance Italy, with 100 different city-states and they\u2019ve all got their own little system of trust and ledgers and coinage. And there is no universal money. And so you can\u2019t have an easy rise of the nation-state under a gold standard or a coinage standard, or at least it\u2019s kind of challenging!"}

And if you have a better money, you have a better economy. And as the money gets \u2014 if we come back to this issue of: Is it shared? Is it immutable? Is it correct? The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more correct. The more effective the economy, the faster the network updates, the faster the economy. So just finishing up on gold \u2014 why does gold fail? In theory \u2014 why does gold fail in theory? It fails because the base layer protocol is okay. It\u2019s kind of God-given by nature. It\u2019s the creation and the smelting of gold. It\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not conservative. The base layer protocol is not conservative. The application level protocol \u2014 that one layer above the base layer, the layer 2 \u2014 the application protocol is difficult and dangerous. But what does that mean? Like so I give you 10 blocks of gold. That\u2019s the base layer. Okay, well, so what are all the applications of gold? What can you do with it? How many people do you know that can actually refine or melt down molten gold and create something with it? That\u2019s the dangerous part and the difficult part. So gold applications, they\u2019re difficult and they\u2019re limited by the laws of physics. And that just means that \u2014 and there is no application protocol. So if I want to do anything with gold above the layer 1 it\u2019s either a very difficult, dangerous application like gold goblets or gold coins or something like that, or I have to create the equivalent of a gold [paper] check, which is a manually implemented protocol. And now we\u2019ve got the same problems we have with a fiat currency. At the point you implement a gold check, you\u2019ve in essence moved on to the Fiat standard with a gold reserve of some sort. So gold fails primarily because there\u2019s no good application protocol. It\u2019s not conservative, it\u2019s too difficult, too slow, too dangerous. And the physicality of it invites violence. I can literally firebomb the city, kill everybody in it, and the gold won\u2019t be damaged. And so when in doubt, shoot first, and then sift through your clothing and take your gold! I don\u2019t have to worry about any collateral damage. The last thing in the world you want to do is be carrying around immutable money on your person. When someone has an incentive just to kill the people and take the money. So that\u2019s the fundamental problem with gold. That\u2019s why the gold standard ultimately has always just been an invitation to war. And never-ending. I think thousands and thousands and thousands of wars \u2014 many wars, right? And an invitation to criminality and an invitation to violence. If the criminals don\u2019t take your gold then the counter-parties take your gold and the counter-parties don\u2019t take your gold then your own government takes your gold and your own government doesn\u2019t take your gold the hostile government takes your gold. But ultimately, gold \u2014 because of its physicality \u2014 is imperfect property. It is imperfect property. And it\u2019s imperfect money, because the token itself is so cumbersome and unwieldy to utilize."}

So it\u2019s almost \u2014 I think it\u2019s an ill-understood aspect of human history that a lot of the violence between countries has been over the gold or about the gold. But it\u2019s not often discussed in the history books."}

I could give you 5,000 accounts of: we sacked the city, we burned it and we took their gold. We might have sacked the city and hauled the people off in slavery. We might have taken their livestock, we prefer to take \u2014 normally the livestock is all dead by the time we take the city though. So the people are dead, the cattle are dead, the food is gone, the water is all gone, but the gold is still there! So generally, if you look at the first 5,000 years, it\u2019s: we sacked the city, we took the gold. Then even in the modern era from 1700, 1800, 1900: We sacked the city. Okay, what do we make off with? There\u2019s not that many diamonds \u2014 normally they\u2019re not easy to find. There\u2019s not a lot of that. Sometimes, you know, the Nazis took the art, right? And the Nazi took the gold. And so there\u2019s a lot of that: we took the gold from the Treasury, Stalin seized the gold during the Spanish Civil War, and the Poles had to smuggle their gold away to keep it from the Nazis. And there\u2019s all sorts of examples of somebody sacking some city or rolling over someone\u2019s border to take their gold. That\u2019s because it\u2019s take-able, right? It\u2019s like, why do you want to take it? Because it\u2019s take-able. But not a single example [for paper currencies]. Like the Nazis didn\u2019t want Norwegian paper currency. They didn\u2019t want Swiss paper currency, they didn\u2019t want the Dutch or the French paper currency. And not many people ask the question, Why? We didn\u2019t take their checks. We didn\u2019t take their securities. Because at the end of the day, securities and derivatives and all these things have no value. Maybe the factory has value. If it\u2019s not destroyed. Maybe the people have value if you get them to work for you. The gold has value but the paper doesn\u2019t."}

But it doesn\u2019t get reported a lot in political history or even military history. I mean some nations successfully did it to the US but we don\u2019t want to talk about it, right? So you won\u2019t read that much but it\u2019s an effective thing you could do. Well anyway, that ends my thoughts on gold. It\u2019s basically a metallic token, and it was our best idea, but it seems to have stopped working thousands of years ago. You could say 2,000 years ago almost certainly they had shared ledgers. And they just used gold as a method of final settlement. And we know that it failed at different points. We know that it was debased and resulted in the collapse of the Roman Empire. And so if Rome was the greatest empire on Earth, when their final settlement network failed, then the empire collapsed and what you have is: history is the endless succession of successive empires rising up with the new gold standard that was not debased, and then generation after generation the coinage of that next empire \u2014 the successor empire \u2014 would be debased, and then that empire would fail and collapse. And then another empire would come along and they would start the cycle over and over again. And yet the myth of gold as immutable money or the sovereign store of value \u2014 it stayed with us for thousands of years into the 20th century. I would say that the gold standard has been dying a slow death \u2014 a death by a thousand cuts. 1914 comes along \u2014 you know we\u2019ve got the golden age from 1870\u20131914 but then World War I comes along and then in 1914 every country abandons the gold standard. And maybe that\u2019s the final cut. And after World War I, the Treaty of Genoa, we came back to a gold reserve standard and in essence we had gold backing the pound and the dollar. And that degree of backing successively slid, so there was a debasement of the pound and the dollar, consistently and gradually. And then of course the pound and the dollar became layer 2 applications if you will, and then every other currency became a layer 3 derivative. And then everything else in the economy was built on those derivatives, so you had basically layers of derivatives of gold that got progressively less backed by tangible energy \u2014 or de-nurtured. And that resulted in who knows how many collapses: the Great Depression. Eventually we get World War II which you could say came out of just a bunch of economic collapses like the Weimar Republic. And all the gold ended up getting centralized and seized by the Americans in Fort Knox, and then we wrapped Bretton Woods around it, and Bretton Woods was the second gold reserve standard of the century, except this time just the dollar was the reserve currency, backed some percentage by gold \u2014 say 40% or 30% by gold. And then every year thereafter it slid from 40% to 30% to 20% \u2014 I shudder to say it must have been less than 10% by 1971. And in 1971 we defaulted on the gold standard. In essence, at that point the gold reserve standard was effectively dead. Gold still has a fiction of being a store of value and an asset, and if you\u2019re looking for a non-sovereign store of value between 1971 and the invention of Bitcoin, you could\u2019ve gone to gold, I guess you could\u2019ve used property like land or commodities, timber rights, oil rights, something like that. And you could\u2019ve used art. There\u2019s probably no one king, right? People dabble with, Is silver a store of value? I think the free market went back and forth but it\u2019s pretty clear that gold kind of died \u2014 it started dying if not had died about 10 years ago as far as I can see, when Bitcoin was formed. And if we look at performance in the last 12 months, just for kicks let\u2019s just go and look at 12 months of performance. So it\u2019s quite a day, right? In 12 months Bitcoin is up 240%. Gold is down 9.82%. Over the course of 10 years Bitcoin is up 132% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), gold is 0.94%. The S&P Index is 13.9% over 10 years. 33% over one year. Summary is: gold is not a store of value over the last decade, it\u2019s something opposite of a store of value. If the S&P is up 33% in 12 months, then a reasonable surrogate for the collapse of purchasing power of the currency in 12 months is the inverse of that, right? But you could say you need 33.7% more money to buy the same share of the S&P. So a store of value has to clock at 33% or better, and gold is -40%, and Bitcoin is +200%. So that\u2019s the marketplace screaming at you that no-one really sees gold as a monetary asset anymore except for the gold bugs."}

Sometimes they would like fly to a branch and they couldn\u2019t land on a branch. They were literally so stupid they couldn\u2019t land on a branch, they could barely fly fast, a lot of them would just accidentally fly into the dirt and slam into the dirt. So when you looked at them and you compared them to other insects, you saw that those other insects are so much better at flying. You take it for granted, but you never really think, Oh those birds are good at flying, they\u2019re fast and strong and smart. Until you see something that isn\u2019t fast and isn\u2019t strong and isn\u2019t smart. And you might say, Well this thing is pretty much history! How could it possibly survive?

So in a world without computers and without cryptography and without networks, you ask yourself: What are you going to do next? The answer is: I\u2019m going to come up with a shared ledger \u2014 I do have math. We\u2019ve got algebra. We got calculus. I do have writing. I can create a shared ledger. And the immutable part is going to come from the institutional credibility.

But the immutability and the credibility comes from an institutional human source. And the greater the institution, the greater the monetary system.

So what I\u2019m getting at is: you graduate college \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you went to school \u2014 but you were like, I\u2019m gonna go into the world, I\u2019m gonna make money, I think you went into investment management, but what was really interesting to me there was that you jumped to China! And you wanted to see the future \u2014 you wanted to live it! And I\u2019m really curious to know how big of a decision that was for you? What other things you were thinking about in terms of careers or locations, really? And just some of the things you might have got from China \u2014 was it the future? I\u2019m more talking about the 10 years that you were there, I\u2019m not talking so much about where we are with China now."}

Yeah in hindsight, reflecting back on it, I\u2019ve always been anti-establishment, anti-authority, not to say that I was a troubled kid. I pretty much was able to maneuver my way by being bad enough that I could have some fun and that kind of thing, but maintaining good enough relationships with older people that I could always smooth it over. But that was always my sense, and I was always a curious kid, and I was fortunate as a youngster to have exposure to a lot of unique individuals, both through travel and through my dad\u2019s occupation and the people he came across. And so I say that only to kind of speculate where or why is it that any of us are more or less curious? That was kind of an open question \u2014 I don\u2019t have an answer to that. But as I grew up, money was something that I recognized as giving you access to the world. Increasing your optionality I guess would be the terminology we\u2019d use today in Bitcoin that you hear a lot! And I also saw the stresses that money placed on my family growing up, and I didn\u2019t want those! I wanted to be free of those! And so I was focused on making \u2014 you know, when I was younger I just wanted to be as rich as possible. But simultaneously \u2014 and totally unintentionally\u2014was just, this is the only definable moment I can really say that it really took flight for me. Because I think we\u2019re all just in the world trying to figure it out, so we all have a certain level of curiosity, of course. But I remember playing with one of the kids on the street when I was 11, 12, and she was my age but she was ahead a year in school. And I was like, What the fuck? I hate school! How are you getting out a year before me? And she was like, Well I just read a lot! And I was like, What the fuck do you mean \u2014 read a lot? That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what we do in school, does it? And she was like, Well, I dunno! School was just easier for me as a result, so they bumped me up! And so I never got bumped up in school, but I took that as \u2014 that kind of set my mind on fire and I was like, This reading thing must have something to it! [05:18] And so I went back to my dad\u2019s bookshelf that day and picked out a book, and I still remember the book it was! It was Hidden Power: Unleashing the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, which was quite an interesting book to start with! Because I\u2019d never considered even the influence of my subconscious mind till then. And so it was kind of revelatory to me, really, and it probably served as a bit more of a foundation than I\u2019ve ever given it credit to subsequent to reading it. Anyways, I started reading a lot and really enjoyed that, and read all the classic Buffett and Graham investing books when I was in high school because I thought, You know, the way to be rich is to work your money! You don\u2019t want to be a wage slave \u2014 you want to basically make money by rent-seeking of other people\u2019s money! So that\u2019s what the plan was in high school. And I did a rotary exchange after high school \u2014 I was in Japan for a year. And it was probably around that time that I realized that China was the future. I think that was 2004\u20135. I\u2019d done a lot of reading about China with all the books available at the time, and it was very clear to me that the 21st Century was gonna be China\u2019s century, as the US was the 20th Century and the UK was for the 19th Century and so on. And Shanghai was the New York, and so I thought \u2014 I actually didn\u2019t want to go to university, I wanted to actually leave high school at grade 11 and just go! \u2014 but I was corralled out of those decisions. In hindsight, unfortunate, but heigh-ho! And so after I finished university, I went down to South America and spent 3\u20134 months there. Part of that was exploring Ayahuasca and learning about that, and another part was partying a little bit too much and traveling around and backpacking and that sort of thing. And then\u2014to answer your question \u2014 there was no trepidation or it wasn\u2019t a very well thought-out thing, I just said, Shanghai is the New York of the 21st Century, that\u2019s where I wanna be! So I booked a one way ticket and I booked a few nights at a hostel and I said, I\u2019ll figure it out, you know! So I flew home from South America, switched out my bags, filled out my backpack with a few different items and booked a one way ticket to Shanghai. I mean I wanted a job in finance, I put my resume around, didn\u2019t get anything, and then I\u2019m a die-hard UFC fan, a guy on a forum said, We\u2019re watching the fights at a bar one night, I end up going to the bar, sitting next to that guy and he ends up being HR for the biggest ex-pat wealth manager at the time, and so I got an interview, got a job, and worked in that capacity for a few years. And all the while during university I had started to change my tune about the principle aim in life being wealth accumulation, and that coincided with exploring the psychedelic realms, or let\u2019s say different aspects of consciousness via certain psychedelic substances. And you know that leaves an indelible mark on you! It\u2019s really difficult to have those experiences and not be changed, and I think a current of change was already happening in me but that certainly accelerated it. And so it took a little bit of the hunger and edge and whoop-ass and take names of my intent of going to Shanghai \u2014 so when I found myself in the wealth management industry, (1) I was a bit disillusioned because I thought it would be a little bit more sincere in terms of what the role of an asset manager is, but you\u2019re a glorified salesperson and you\u2019re told to sell, sell, sell, basically. And that\u2019s the same pretty much everywhere. And so I ended up not liking the industry, not liking the job, but still wanting to be in China because you know this is where the Bitcoin narrative kind of has really impacted my life is: I hate to say this, but my initial years in China I kind of lost myself, which is weird for me to say because I\u2019ve always been someone who took care of my health and took care of my intellect and tried to learn and tried to grow and tried to continue develop myself and not be wrapped up in a lot of the things that people get wrapped up in, whether they be substance abuse or bad lifestyle habits or bad relationships or all that kind of stuff. [10:05] But my assessment of the world at the time from having consumed a ton of resources about anything I could find about every industry and how it all worked \u2014 we all try to piece together the world in our own ways and that\u2019s what I tried to do. And I wasn\u2019t left with a great impression in terms of what was in store for the world. And so once the kick-ass nature of my desire to go to China and work in Finance dissolved away, I was a little bit left with \u2014 a bit aimless is I guess the way to put it! So I probably didn\u2019t treat myself as well as I should have during that time, but I still felt that China was the place to be: I still thought it was the future and I thought there was opportunity there, and I loved the energy there. I mean Shanghai is a modern city and there\u2019s a great ex-pat population and the young local people are awesome. It\u2019s a really great place to live, if you can handle the pollution. I stayed there and I ended up going back to school for 3 years and I studied natural medicine and then I worked in that capacity in Shanghai also. But I guess it was in 2014 I came across Bitcoin, or finally got in. And then in 2015 I interviewed Bobby Lee who at the time was the head of BTCC which was one of the longest-running Bitcoin exchanges in the world and he was kind of a \u201ccentral figure\u201d or \u201cpopular figure\u201d in the mix of Bitcoin. And that really started turning my perspective around, because\u2014as is so often the case these days when you hear anyone talk about Bitcoin, and I think Saylor has done a great job amplifying that message \u2014 is: Bitcoin is hope! Bitcoin represents so much hope for the future, because it remedies so many of the fundamental issues that plague society and culture and markets and economies today. And that started to dawn on me. And like I think is the case for everybody, you go down the rabbit hole and you say, This is interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Wow! This is really interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Holy shit! And then you go a little further and you find yourself obsessed and not able to really think or do anything else beyond the obligations that you have! And that\u2019s kind of what happened with me. And so I left China in mid-2018, I went down to Thailand and ended up meeting someone there and we just basically have stayed there for over a year. And I find myself stuck in Canada at the moment with the COVID nonsense that\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the closed-notes version of the story. But I think the more relevant point, because that may have been boring to some, what Bitcoin has done for me is \u2014 I mean it dramatically reorients many things in your perspective \u2014 but I kind of thought that like it was a fait accompli that China was gonna take over the world, and it probably still is even if everyone\u2019s on a fair playing field. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Bitcoin standard everywhere, I think that\u2019s probably still going to be the case! But because of Bitcoin, it\u2019s kind of reinvigorated everywhere else in the world, and Bitcoin is everywhere, right? And so I can get my rocks off about being at the vanguard of a momentous shift, and one that\u2014far more the case in Bitcoin than in China \u2014 is representative of an extremely positive change, I can be involved in that anywhere. And so part of the reason why I was in Shanghai was I just didn\u2019t want to miss out on it! I thought this was like a massive historical shift and I kind of wanted to be at the center of it! I wanted to be in New York at the turn of the 20th Century, or early 1900s, right? And now I don\u2019t so much feel that pull, because I think the big story\u2014the macro narrative of our time \u2014 is definitely Bitcoin now. And Bitcoin is such that you can be involved in it anywhere! So now it\u2019s sort of re-framed in my mind that the most important thing, and the thing that I most focus on, is maximizing sovereignty and freedom. How can I construct my life so that I have the highest degree of optionality and freedom to live the life I want to with my friends and family and loved ones and all that kind of stuff, and that\u2019s the big story that I think is unfolding for a lot of Bitcoiners right now."}

There\u2019s lots to unpack there that I want to get into. One of the things you said, I think in the Cosmic Deep Dive, is before Bitcoin, the external world caused you to withdraw, and that there were bright and dark spots then. And I really related to that in the sense that I think in my 20s I really wanted to find Truth and Fairness and Freedom, but I think a lot about this fair side of it, where I didn\u2019t think the world was fair, I didn\u2019t like a lot of what I was encountering in the external world, and I did withdraw! And I really waffled between whether I\u2019m an introvert who built up extroverted skills, or I\u2019m an extrovert who just reverted from the world and didn\u2019t want to deal with a lot that was coming my way. I didn\u2019t feel that I could get ahead fairly. Like you were saying, it seemed that the best way to get ahead was rent-seeking! I remember in college I studied Finance, I learned all the tricks, I learned how really big players made a lot of money. None of it seemed fair to me. I think that was one of the reasons I dreamed \u2014 you know growing up I watched things like Family Ties. I wanted to be an investment banker like Alex P. Keaton and by the time I got there I was like, I don\u2019t want to spend my life doing that! Sucking \u2014 you know, being a parasite! Because I don\u2019t think that \u2014 I recognized that, while the intellectual capacity of the globe was going to Finance, that\u2019s not really what was creating value for the world. You were just moving around digits and monetizing transactions. And so in my 20s I think it made me really think about exploring myself, and I think that was one of the reasons I fell into things like \u201cpartying\u201d or making that kind of lifestyle, where you\u2019re looking to be with your friends, you\u2019re living for today. And it wasn\u2019t until \u2014 I think without Bitcoin I had a lot of despair! The world just seemed dark, and it didn\u2019t seem like a place you could get ahead unless you worked more than other people at some hamster wheel someone else created, or was a rent-seeker. And that was just not fun! And you just looked for fun elsewhere, and you lived for today, I think. One of the things you said that really stuck with me is that at 11 years old you discovered reading, and you went to your father\u2019s bookshelf and you picked off \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of that book but it has a fascinating title for an 11 year old or any age. So I\u2019m wondering, Did your parents encourage reading? And what I\u2019m getting at there is: Did they encourage curiosity and truth-seeking?"}
{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-matrix-podcast-john-vallis-bullish-on-bitcoiners-fdc255edcd98?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [17:43]: Yeah. I can\u2019t remember \u2014 I think it was 11, 12, 13, somewhere around there. But that was definitely the book. No! They didn\u2019t! There was no encouragement of that type whatsoever. You know, my parents \u2014 I think this is a positive thing: they\u2019ve always been very supportive, which, all you can really ask out of parents is love and support. I mean, because who the fuck knows how to bring another human being into the world, right? What are the best ways to treat a fresh mind and mold it and form it into someone who\u2019s fit to go out into this crazy world and succeed and be happy? Who the fuck knows how to do that? So I think you gotta default into just saying, Did they love you and did they support you in the best way that they could? And in my case the answer was definitely, Yes! But there wasn\u2019t much specific direction of that kind. They weren\u2019t like, Hey man, you gotta read in order to be smart and successful in the future. They just wanted me to go to school, behave, do well at school, and come home and not cause too much trouble! And that\u2019s what I did, but I think maybe why that worked for me is because it just gave me the space to explore on my own and to say like, Nobody is pushing me in one direction or another\u2014I get to choose! And I chose to \u2014 like I said before \u2014 I think I benefited from having certain people in my life as a result of both my family and my dad\u2019s occupation, who in hindsight, I can look back now and say that they were very unique people. And I think for the right type of mind, which was mine, who would be curious about unusual people, I think that fed the flames of my curiosity to say like, Why are those people like that? And what makes them tick? You know, just getting different personalities and looks and types of people \u2014 exposure to them when you\u2019re younger I think is beneficial because you kind of see that its not a cookie-cutter approach to \u201chow people are\u201d. People can be a lot of different ways! And there\u2019s a lot of different positive attributes and negative attributes that people have. And to see that spectrum when you\u2019re young and to perhaps naturally gravitate towards one end of it, like the more curious, unconventional, anti-authoritarian \u2014 however you want to characterize it \u2014 I think that that was an initial push in that direction, and then my own curiosity just took over and it led to this life!"}

I remember when I was really young, I was probably at 7 or 8, both my parents were public school teachers. And I turned to my dad and I turned to my pop and I said, I want to be a teacher like you! And he kind of grabbed me by the elbow and was like, I worked too hard! Don\u2019t ever become a teacher! And he wasn\u2019t telling me don\u2019t become an educator.

I mean, they busted their ass and I\u2019m really happy with everything they\u2019ve given me, but it was very striking to me that \u2014 it was a little bit of a lesson of, Take care of yourself, it felt like!

So it\u2019s almost like the nominal amount of money probably wasn\u2019t the issue. It may very well have been their relationship to money and to wealth and to their spending, and so whatever it was, it was definitely something that was very very seared into my mind, like I don\u2019t want to have that kind of stress in my life. Like I can tell that that kind of stress is unhealthy. That type of stress\u2014it just isn\u2019t good and I didn\u2019t want it. So I think that kind of fostered that desire to really go after money, but as a said, you can\u2019t help what you really believe. And this is something that you only learn maybe when you get older, or for most people. But you can\u2019t fool you. You can fool everybody else for a time, but you can\u2019t fool you. And that\u2019s the tricky part, and that\u2019s the part that requires courage when you come to that \u2014 a lot of people have difficult times in their life, and maybe it\u2019s a crisis moment or maybe it\u2019s just an accumulation of experience where you say like, I gotta just step up and do what feels right and true to me. Not to anybody else, not for any other reason than, This is actually who I currently am, and this is the journey that I\u2019m on, and the place in that journey that I\u2019m at. And you know, that\u2019s difficult! And one of the things that gets me so excited about Bitcoin is that a big impediment to people being actually able to do that is the financial concern, right? Like I have to be Lawyer John because every day I go and be Lawyer John \u2014 if I\u2019m anything other than Lawyer John I can\u2019t put food on the table, I can\u2019t pay my bills, I can\u2019t support my family, whatever it is. But Bitcoin is providing a very very very unique opportunity I think for people to put themselves in a situation where the financial concerns are becoming less and less and ultimately, hopefully, no impediment to them expressing who they truly are! I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s super easy. I mean a big part of my development and all the traveling and escapades that I went on was trying to figure out and refine what exactly that was. And trying to explore. We talk about looking out on the world and being a bit concerned with how it looked and not very motivated to pushing to the future \u2014 that despair that you mentioned. And you know, a big part of my searching \u2014 traveling and trying different experiences and stuff \u2014 was kind of me saying, Surely there\u2019s more than this! Like once you put together a piece of the world and you see maybe it doesn\u2019t look so good to you, you come away with like, Surely there\u2019s more! And I kept just following that impulse and I refused to believe that there was no answer to that question. [25:25] I maintained the belief that surely there was! Again I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to do but I think a lot of people who are set free financially by being involved in Bitcoin now and into the future, I think the degree of sovereignty that permits is going to allow them to have the choice to actually become or be or express who they genuinely are, and I think that\u2019s of huge benefit to the world and of course it\u2019s of massive benefit to the individual, because there\u2019s nothing worse than having to act in a manner that is not genuine. Having to be someone who you\u2019re not. And that characterizes probably most people in the world today, and I\u2019m really excited for more and more people being able to step out of that fa\u00e7ade and start to explore and express who they really are!"}

I can relate to a lot of that! I wonder how much watching our parents \u2014 like my parents were hardworking people. My father even had a second job working at flea markets and kind of just trying to provide more. I don\u2019t know how much what we saw was their relationship to money as to inflation. Because they were doing what they were supposed to do and it was still a struggle to do and accomplish all the things that we wanted or needed. And I use wanted and needed interchangeably there but I know the difference. But it\u2019s interesting you told a particularly interesting anecdote on the Cosmic Deep Dive about \u2014 and I think it relates to what you were talking about with genuineness \u2014 where you came home and you were out drinking with your friends, and instead of telling your parents you were having having snacks with Johnny and Tommy, you were like, This is what I did, I\u2019m a little tired right now, and we can deal with this later. And in that reference point what struck me was you were like, I\u2019m about truth, and if I lie to this important people, all I\u2019m doing is forking reality. And I thought that was a really interesting concept. I also wonder how much \u2014 have you always been a wanderer and are you still a wanderer? Or do you think you were searching for something and you might have found it? I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but do you still feel that wandering spirit?"}
{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-matrix-podcast-john-vallis-bullish-on-bitcoiners-fdc255edcd98?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------", "title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "text": "John Vallis [27:46]: Right. So that story is true, and you said it perfectly! I can\u2019t remember how I articulated it at the Cosmic Deep Dive, but I\u2019ve always felt that way. I always had a reverence for truth, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little bit more complex, but the most simplest way that it manifested in my mind was, If I don\u2019t tell the truth, then I\u2019ve created a false reality. Right? Both for myself and the person whom I\u2019m lying to. And I\u2019ve always had such a burning curiosity and desire to understand reality. I mean this is what all this searching is about, and this is what going into the jungle and spending time with psychedelic brews and that kind of stuff is all about. It\u2019s like trying to figure out what is really going on here! And it was repugnant to me to be complicit in the creation of illusion, and to fostering more false reality than I already perceived there was \u2014 even at that young age! So that\u2019s why I always did my best to tell the truth, even if it landed me in the hot water sometimes. Now in that particular case it wasn\u2019t that hard because I was already caught red-handed. [28:58] Like, I might as well own up to it because I wasn\u2019t getting out of it! But that has always been definitely something that \u2014 not necessarily intentionally \u2014 I just always felt really uncomfortable to do anything but [tell the truth]. And to the second part: definitely a lot of wandering, for that very reason! But Bitcoin has grounded me, in a way. It\u2019s also caused a lot of my previous interests and education and knowledge acquisition or whatever you want to call all of that, to converge on something that seems to be able to house all of those interests and all of that knowledge, and really give it a gravity and really make it relevant. So in a way I think the wandering has maybe been exacerbated, but it\u2019s been far more focused, right? Like I don\u2019t have to tell you the Bitcoin rabbit hole is very deep and so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m consuming less information these days and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m contemplating what I know and trying to recognize patterns any less. If anything I think it\u2019s more, because Bitcoin kind of forces you to do that, but it\u2019s grounding in that I\u2019m no longer searching for the thing, you know? My universe of really meaningful things \u2014 I\u2019m happy where that is right now! I think Bitcoin is \u2014 well not that it was ever going to be, because it didn\u2019t exist at the beginning of this journey \u2014 but to me it represents a tool that can dissolve a lot of that despair that I previously felt, away. It can restructure and reorient both individuals and as a result of that, the structures and institutions that we see in society. And then once you begin to explore that relationship a bit more, you start to be not just relieved but excited, because you understand the relationship between the money and the individual and the culture. And that I think makes us all excited, and this term \u201cThe Bitcoin Renaissance\u201d that we all often use I think comes from a recognition that this can be the foundation for something amazing, incredible, extraordinary! And so why not feed into that? Why not give that your energy? Your intellectual energy, your financial energy, whatever. Like, how could you not, basically is where I\u2019m at! And I love that, because in my search for meaning before, the psychedelic realms were probably it, right? Taking care of your body and being healthy and all that kind of stuff, but the apex was just the mystery of the psychedelic state of consciousness. Like, what is that? And even though we can\u2019t answer that question, you could tell that it was extremely personal, extremely beneficial experience, and that\u2019s kind of why I kept going back to that well. But, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s imbalanced if you only derive meaning \u2014 not to say only derive meaning from that realm, but to hold that realm or that experience up as like the apex \u2014 I think it leaves a lot to be desired in meat space, in the physical world. Because you can have this Godlike experience, but you come back down and the world still looks the same, like it doesn\u2019t change anything, and so my greatest hope prior to Bitcoin was that I always believed the world could change in an instant! Because all that needs to happen is that people need to change their minds, and then we\u2019d have a different world. But practically speaking, well that\u2019s not very practical! I mean how do you get 8 Billion people just to change their minds on a dime? And it seemed like the forces at work at society, like yes there were bright spots and maybe even their brightness was growing, but there are also big dark spots and that seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle. And Bitcoin has come around and embodied a lot of those principles actually that are represented in the psychedelic realm as well. Of: individual responsibility and individual sovereignty and control over your own domain, and represented that in the \u201cphysical realm\u201d to actually be a tool to foster a lot of those things. To take individuals who are like-minded \u2014 and I kind of hate this term but let\u2019s say awakened individuals \u2014 people that are kind of waking up from the malaise of the cultural conditioning that so many people are subjected to from the time they\u2019re born, and saying, Something\u2019s off here! How can we make it better? I think Bitcoin represents such a great tool to foster that! And so you put those two things together and I feel like we\u2019re kind of attacking it from both sides, and simultaneously, because of course neither one is restricted to one domain, but of course what I love about Bitcoin and what I love exploring with people that I talk to, is how Bitcoin is changing people! [34:31] And not just their financial circumstances and not just how much optionality they have to move around and that kind of stuff, but like, Why is it affecting what you eat and how you treat your body and who you spend time with? And your aspirations for your family in the future? And the amount of time you spend in nature? And I don\u2019t want to cast too wide a net here and I know everyone has a different experience, but those are very common things that crop up, and I think you could put them all under the category of: People are trying to better themselves in more ways than just their bank account. And so there\u2019s a lot of overlap there with people that were on the psychedelic pursuit and exploring those realms. I just think it\u2019s awesome! So I find that they balance each other well, so to answer your question a little bit more succinctly, I think I have stopped wandering a lot! I\u2019d love to find a place that valued freedom and sovereignty that was settled already \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re there yet \u2014 but I think hopefully in our lifetimes that\u2019ll become clear. And really put down some roots. But otherwise, I can\u2019t imagine being involved in anything more exciting right now, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna be here for a while."}

It\u2019s really interesting that you bring up the psychedelic realm and some of the truths or things that that unlocks.

And I\u2019m getting at that more maybe with family but also career-wise? Did you feel that you were putting your career off? At that young age you want to create wealth, you want to seize opportunities, and you also want to \u2014 regardless of how you feel about the external world \u2014 you kind of have to put out your resume and talk about things.

And this may go back to the, Tell my mom if I could just go to bed and we can deal with this in the morning. To me the trade-off of not expressing how I truly felt about something was never worth it. And that\u2019s probably held me back at least financially in my career or in different domains. I can\u2019t give you a specific reason why, but I\u2019ve never catered to that end. Right? So I think a lot of people cater to the end of climbing the corporate ladder or getting more money or whatever. I always \u2014 the highest priority was that nobody felt that I wasn\u2019t telling them how I really felt about something, that I wasn\u2019t telling the truth. And not even for the other person \u2014 that\u2019s always been for me! I couldn\u2019t put up with being afraid to say something that I actually felt was valuable or that I believed in! The most common place I\u2019ve bumped up against this was with my parents, because I always felt like I was never crazy. I always felt like I could logically justify and articulate why it is I was pursuing what I was pursuing. And even if those things were unconventional from a mainstream perspective, I still felt like I could justify them. And if you wanted to challenge me on them I\u2019d be more than happy to entertain it. But I think my parents and friends and stuff like that figured out early on that you better have your shit together if you\u2019re gonna challenge me on certain things, the things that I\u2019ve chosen to be vocal about or engaged in. Because I don\u2019t do things willy-nilly! Like, I didn\u2019t just go down to \u2014 to use an obvious example \u2014 like my mom was terrified when I told her at 20 or 21 that I was gonna go down to the rainforest for 3\u20134 months and take the most powerful psychedelic known to man and live in a hut with a shaman. Like, you know, for some moms that\u2019s a bit worrying!"}

But now it\u2019s demystifying \u2014 it\u2019s just a tool! You know, you can take a hammer, you could build or you could destroy. And when you put it in that framework, do you think Bitcoin is revelatory, or it\u2019s just something that we found in nature and we wanted it and now it\u2019s here? At some point when Bitcoin is just money, the conversations that we\u2019ve been having around money dwindle a bit. You\u2019ve still gotta educate people about money, saving for their future and stuff, but it\u2019s not so big a deal anymore! It\u2019s just the thing we use! And so in that regard, do you think Bitcoin is a revelation, or just something that we\u2019ve been waiting for and now it\u2019s here?"}

I would say that first on a very basic level, we won\u2019t be talking about Bitcoin in 50\u2013100 years. Because it\u2019ll be so fundamental and foundational to the culture and society at that time that it\u2019s not novel anymore. People don\u2019t really talk about the Internet broadly anymore as they did maybe in the early 90\u2019s. Any tool, I guess we value any tool, maybe even revere tools, dependent upon what they permit! What are the possibilities that the tool represents? And to that degree we revere them. And I think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people that think about this deeply are starting to realize that this tool \u2014 like everything, all technology\u2019s a tool \u2014 everything outside of our physical bodies that we want to use to take action in the world is a tool, right? And I just think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people are starting to understand what this tool represents for possibility now and into the future. What kind of novel possibilities for action does this tool represent? And I think that\u2019s why the rabbit hole is so deep, and that\u2019s why understanding money is so deep, because when you understand what we use money for and how it\u2019s evolved in the history of money and that kind of stuff, and its implications and the relationship that individuals have with it and how it fosters the culture and the society that gets built on top of it. I think what we\u2019re realizing is that this tool represents a dramatically positive shift in how we relate to one another economically and then of course as a collective where things grow on top of that. So on that level maybe it\u2019s just a tool, but everything speaks to us as more than just what it is. There\u2019s an affect to everything. You may just say value is subjective, so this acorn here that\u2019s on my table now, it\u2019s kind of worthless to me, it\u2019s nothing. But to other people they might really like it, so what\u2019s going on there when people really value something, like what it \u201cmeans\u201d to them is a pretty tricky and deep question, but I think what Bitcoin\u2019s gonna end up doing is allowing us to explore further ourselves about what the potential for human action and human coordination and cooperation is, and what can result from new and novel methods of interacting. And that may sound boring or mechanical, but I don\u2019t think it is. I mean I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about, right? We\u2019ve been talking about exploring our own consciousness, exploring the world, trying to tease out who and what we are and what we want to do with this opportunity that we have as being human beings on Earth, and a tool like this dramatically expands those things on many different levels and domains, and that is a deeply deeply meaningful thing and I think that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s being treated with such reverence by the hardcores right now."}

And something else you said earlier on one of those podcasts was that Bitcoin self-selects. And I\u2019m kind of curious how maybe Bitcoin changed your behavior, because I find that you were \u2014 like my parents and maybe myself \u2014 Bitcoiners before Bitcoin! Like, trying to find that fair world. Trying to match your internal with your externalities. Trying to find that stasis or that peaceful dynamic. So I\u2019m kind of curious how that changed your behavior. And you said something very early on in the show that you interviewed Bobby Lee. And I remember Bobby Lee as a heightened character in the earlier Bitcoin days, so that was a get! That was someone important to talk to at that time. He was prominent. But up until that point where you were talking, interviewing wasn\u2019t a part of your job-set per se. You were working, you came across Bitcoin, but now all of a sudden you were interviewing someone! I\u2019m kind of curious a little bit about that moment and how you came to change from just learning about Bitcoin to actually interviewing someone and thinking that that was something that \u2014 I don\u2019t know why you thought that would bring you benefit \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t! I interview people, it brings me tremendous benefit. But how you came to that notion that you should, could, would interview someone, and how it just changed your behavior personally?"}

The cliche changes that get bandied around as what Bitcoiners do when they fall down the rabbit hole, many of them had already been integrated I guess into my character and into my life, but you cannot discount the impact and the power of hope. And not even just hope, like I was saying before, like not only that the future doesn\u2019t look so dark anymore, but that it looks really really really bright and exciting \u2014 I think part of the reason it inspires change is because like if you don\u2019t have something drawing you forward, then the relevance of novel information that you encounter on a daily basis and even the radar you have up for your sensitivity to acquiring useful knowledge, is dramatically diminished! Because if you don\u2019t see a reason to refine yourself now in order to function better in the future, there\u2019s nothing pulling you forward, then you\u2019re gonna be kind of numb, your sensitivity is gonna be much less to all the things that you could pick up in your environment that could make you more fit for the future. And I think this was part of the reason why so many people today treat their bodies and their minds really poorly! They consume junk television and Netflix and binge-watch all this stuff, several hours a day they stuff their face full of shitty foods, their consciousness is not sensitive to all the different cues and pieces of information and knowledge in their environment that might go toward making them more fit for the future. And so obviously time preference plays into this, but I just think, when you don\u2019t see much on the horizon, there\u2019s no real natural impulse to make yourself more fit to take advantage of it. And if you see really not-good stuff on the horizon, you\u2019re far more incentivized to kind of ignore the noise of information that you might use, and just get your rocks off now! Just go for sensual pleasure! But if you see hope on the horizon, then it shines a spotlight back, and especially the more you learn about the relationship of money to the structure of society, and when you go down that Bitcoin rabbit hole, you see the potential for what it could create in the future, well then the spotlight comes back on you and says, Are you as ready as you could be to take advantage of that? Because that shit\u2019s gonna be awesome! Are you ready? Like, are you taking care of yourself enough? Are you cultivating yourself physically, intellectually, spiritually, all these different ways in order to maximize the benefit of that thing that you now see on the horizon? And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why a lot of Bitcoiners are inspired to change in the ways that they have, and I think we\u2019re just at the beginning of this thing, man! This wasn\u2019t really a big part of the narrative like 3\u20134 years ago. I would say that this whole Bitcoin changes you thing, at least as it\u2019s talked about today, is like 2 years old! Maybe a little bit longer. But it\u2019s really amazing how quickly it can take effect, and that\u2019s why I like to joke what we\u2019re all gonna be like at the next halving \u2014 that\u2019s more than 3 years away! Like, what are we gonna look like then, when people are reporting \u2014 you know I\u2019ve talked to people that got in on March of 2020 and 6 months later they\u2019re telling me all the different dramatic ways they changed their life in 6 months! I mean what happens when it\u2019s a year, 2 years, 4 years? So I think that\u2019s one of the powerful impacts of hope, is that it actually sensitizes you to interact with your environment as though it had greater meaning, because it now held greater purpose and prospects for a better future, whereas before it didn\u2019t. So I feel like that\u2019s one of the ways that it really tunes you to just act differently and treat your environment differently. [50:46] What was the second part of that question?"}

But you know, I want to say my parents were Bitcoiners before Bitcoin: They lived for the future. They always sacrificed today for tomorrow, and they sacrificed themselves for their children. I don\u2019t know what their lives were like before us. But I had despair and I think that\u2019s why in my 20\u2019s I was just seeking pleasure. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not saying I was all about pleasure in the physical world\u2014 but I was living for today. And just trying to enhance myself. Like yourself I spent 5 years actually at one of the Big Four accounting firms, and then I left to go on a 3-month journey through the South-Pacific by myself. Really just to chisel out myself and you know there\u2019s nothing like \u2014 when you\u2019re a tourist and you\u2019re with people you might go see the Grand Canyon but it\u2019s like, What do you think? I don\u2019t know! What do you think?\u2014When you\u2019re by yourself it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have to be here if I don\u2019t want to be here. Why am I here? Why am I doing whatever I\u2019m doing? Before Bitcoin the external world caused you to withdraw and it would bring dark spots. But one of the things is it\u2019s like, Now the future is brighter! And you did touch on this thing: In the Western World we have a crisis of diseases of despair. And a lot of times when you hear news or narratives, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 well it\u2019s always someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 but some opinions you hold a little bit more closely or value. So when you said something to that effect, it really struck a chord because I see the despair, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s greater than before! So in my 20\u2019s I\u2019m wandering but in my 30\u2019s I happened to get married, I fell in love, I found my wife, my soul-mate, and I had children. And I kind of had to give the wandering up for them, and give my own despair up for them, and just get it done and not bring it home, and figure out a way to get ahead. And it was a constant scramble, because you\u2019re doing the job, you\u2019re trying to figure it out, and things are always running away from you. But I had to just buckle down and figure it out! There\u2019s no excuses, right? But when I found Bitcoin, things got a lot brighter, because I had \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna say a way out \u2014 but I had control over my own money in the sense that no one could debase it. Not control like censorability or seizability or any of those things, but like, No one\u2019s gonna eff with my money! And that really changed my whole outlook. So I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on this crisis of despair for people who haven\u2019t found Bitcoin? And when I say that I don\u2019t want to make it sound like Bitcoin is their salvation, as much as it can be for us \u2014 again I think the salvation comes from within, and we were looking for Bitcoin, that\u2019s why we found it. You said it before: Bitcoin self-selects! Ideas have people, we had that idea in our head for some reason that we needed to find a better way. But what do you make of the despair around the globe and how real or actual or heavy that is?"}

But I think most people if they\u2019re empathetic enough, if they\u2019re sensitive enough, they\u2019re paying attention enough, they can see that there\u2019s a lot of [despair] in the world today. And it\u2019s covered over in myriad ways and like what I was saying earlier, people don\u2019t act like how they truly feel! They act like how people expect them to, and how they need to act to advance their position whether that be familial, corporate, whatever! Whatever games they\u2019re in, they\u2019re acting in the manner that will advance their position in those games. And on that note you could say that fiat currency is creating a perverse meta-game and it\u2019s creating all these avatars of people that are not acting in accord with who they truly are, but in accord with what the game requires of them. And I think the last year has been really revealing of this. But I try to be empathetic, and I think at a core level we\u2019re all the same, and I think we\u2019re born in different locations to different families in different languages and all that kind of stuff, and as a result we appear different, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything really that separates us on a fundamental level. But people seem to be very confused, I guess is the nicest way to say it! And consumed by fear and not taking it upon themselves to construct their own worldview, but having one imposed on them, and they\u2019re complicit in it, of course. You don\u2019t have to go that way! But most people do, and they end up being a shadow of themselves, and they end up being avatars of this extremely perverse system that we have. And look, I don\u2019t want to be exclusively critical of this. Like, obviously there are bright moments: We could readily admit that people are conditioned by the mainstream media and the nation state and the fiat currency regime, but when you have a nice moment that [it\u2019s] your kids birthday, or when you have a beautiful moment with a loved one, or when a family member \u2014 you know like there are pockets of pure, genuine joy and experience all over at all times \u2014 and to me that\u2019s real. There\u2019s nothing intermediating that experience when it happens for real. But that\u2019s the exception. Most of the time people kind of withdraw into the conditioned, culturally determined behavior that people have come to believe is the most effective way of maneuvering themselves in this world. And I can\u2019t remember who said this quote but I remember as a youngster it always \u2014 I said it to myself often, actually, as a way to console myself for being frustrated and also curious why the world seemed so weird to me\u2014It\u2019s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society. I want to say it was Krishnamurti but I don\u2019t think it was him."}

But I can\u2019t be sure about that. Anyway, that was a bit of a mantra for me for a time, because I was seeing a lot of what I thought was irrational, crazy behavior around me and wondering why I didn\u2019t feel compelled to mimic it or to engage in the same type of behavior. And my assessment was: The society is quite sick! And I didn\u2019t at the time know that the huge reason for that was the money, I just knew that that was the case, and mainstream media and government and all the rest \u2014 I knew those were all influences. And so that quote and that way of thinking helped me maintain my steadfastness perhaps in not acquiescing and going into that. But to circle back to your question, I think there\u2019s a ton of [despair]. I think the system as it\u2019s structured right now and the siphoning off of wealth surreptitiously from people and also the macro structure of society and culture as a result of being predicated on this unfair monetary system that dominates globally, it\u2019s definitely exacerbating the propensity to fall into despair. [59:43] And all the different downstream effects \u2014 the mental health issues and the substance abuse and the anger and the frustration, and all of these things that are toxic to the individual and to relationships and to society. Obviously they\u2019re all latent within us, but I think it exacerbates them tremendously. And so I think if we wound up on a different monetary standard \u2014 one that could not be corrupted, like Bitcoin, one that was fair for everybody \u2014I think we\u2019d see a lot less of that. And in fact, when I was working in natural health, mind-body medicine or psychophysiology was something I was very interested in, and I\u2019ve said this a bunch only half-jokingly and I actually don\u2019t consider it a joke at all anymore, but I think for a therapist, someone in a therapeutic setting where they\u2019re dealing with these issues all the time now, I think it\u2019s critical that you include education about Bitcoin into the therapeutic stack, because understanding \u2014 I mean a huge element of despair is looking out at your environment and feeling like it doesn\u2019t jive with you. It doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s overbearing, or there\u2019s no hope, or there\u2019s no place for you in it, you feel alienated and isolated and all this stuff, I feel like if you understood Bitcoin and what it meant for how the external world might change, that would dramatically change your perception of how well you could integrate with the external world. And I think that\u2019s a huge aspect of mental health issues! So I think it should be integrated into the protocol stack, the therapeutic stack for mental health professionals. We\u2019re a long way off of that, but I think it should! So I see a lot less despair, mental health issues, on a Bitcoin standard. I know for a fact that it\u2019s had dramatic impacts on Bitcoiners. I\u2019ve talked with Bitcoiners, and they\u2019ve said this publicly on shows I\u2019ve done with them, that were basically suicidal. I\u2019m not gonna dig into the reasons for that, but that was where they were at. And as a result of grokking Bitcoin and starting to see it, their life has completely turned around! Ended up coming out of that and starting a family and being more financially secure and having hope for the future. And this is a huge part, man, that we haven\u2019t touched on yet, but we talk about Bitcoin as a tool and what kind of affect it has and why it draws out these behaviors and what it means for the future. But one thing that is becoming a more and more clear element of this phenomenon is the people that are communicating with each other, the \u201ccommunity\u201d that\u2019s emerging, the culture that\u2019s around this thing! [1:02:44] Like I\u2019m starting to think \u2014 Number Go Up is hands down the most, what brings people in \u2014 but in a world that\u2019s increasingly divisive and tumultuous and in conflict and vicious and all of this stuff, I think more and more people are gonna be looking at this community of people that are hopeful for the future, committed to intellectual refinement, and have very strong principles and integrity and are expressing themselves genuinely and also like to have fun, like I think part of the reason why we, you and I and everybody listening to this, feel good about being in Bitcoin is definitely the natural attributes of Bitcoin and what that means for how we can conduct our life, but it\u2019s also the fact that I can jump on a call with you now and I know that we\u2019re exactly on the same wavelength! And I can do that and I have done that with hundreds of other Bitcoiners! You know, I do a lot of calls that are not broadcast, and it just amazes me that every time I jump on one it\u2019s like there\u2019s no lag \u2014 we\u2019re immediately running right out of the gate. And going back to that piece about feeling isolated \u2014 you on your journey, me on mine \u2014 we\u2019re kind of looking for meaning and being like, There\u2019s not many people that I feel like I have a connection with, I\u2019m just really not jiving with a lot of people. And then to come into this thing and be like, Holy shit! Now there\u2019s hundreds if not thousands of people that I\u2019m sure when we meet in real life we\u2019re gonna become friends really quickly, and who are thinking like I do and who are articulating themselves in a manner that I articulate myself and there\u2019s so many similarities! And that\u2019s so powerful, man! The power of community! And I think that\u2019s one of the elements of why there\u2019s so much despair, because people are increasingly cut off, but I think that\u2019s also why this phenomenon is gonna be so therapeutic for people and draw so many in, because they see this positive culture emerging from this thing and they\u2019re gonna want to be a part of it!"}

I agree with everything you said and I really recognize that power of community. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt that at all since maybe college when you\u2019re spending a lot of time with people and you\u2019re really connect very quickly. I also related a lot to what you said about [being] consumed with fear, and like I said I made a commitment: I have a family\u2014I was gonna get through this thing no matter what! Not through this thing, I am gonna get through this thing no matter what, and I\u2019m gonna do everything I can for them. But before Bitcoin I can relate to that lack of control, and you\u2019re doing everything you can but there are certain elements \u2014 there\u2019s this tool, the money\u2019s the tool \u2014 the denominator is out of control. But before we turn to the really fun stuff that I want to get into with you, I\u2019d love to ask you a little bit about China in the 21st Century \u2014 what you\u2019ve gleaned? You haven\u2019t been there \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been \u2014 but you left living there in 2018 so it\u2019s about 2\u20133 years, but you still seem to have a lot of conviction about where they\u2019re pivoting going forward regardless of what Bitcoin does! And so I\u2019m just kind of curious a little bit about what you saw in China and why you had this conviction of them being the leader of the 21st Century? I\u2019m not even getting into whether that\u2019s good or bad! Just what is it about that that steers you in that direction, that foresight?"}

So any conversation of China is tainted with the bad things, the evil stuff the government gets up to, right? Obviously I\u2019m no defender of what they do, but when I first tried to understand the world, one question that comes to anybody who looks at this is like, Why is the US \u2014 like in our lifetimes the US has been the dominant global power \u2014 why? That\u2019s a pretty obvious question lurking out there. I remember \u2014 I think it was in high school, maybe it was a little bit after \u2014 but Jared Diamond wrote two books: Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. And he was basically trying to illustrate or explore why the world ended up looking the way it looked. Why does Europe have all the countries that it has? Why is America there and Canada there? And the sovereign individual is probably an extension of that in the 20th and 21th Century, but it basically looks at what are the factors, the technologies, the demographic factors, the geographic factors that lead to the world looking like the way it looks like. And obviously the way the world looks is in constant flux, even though right now it seems pretty set, but I mean if you look at a map of let\u2019s say the geographic boundaries of Europe over the last 1,000 years I mean it\u2019s nothing but fragmentation and consolidation and fragmentation and consolidation and change! Like, that\u2019s just what we do! So why are we at where we\u2019re at right now? And that in addition to China \u2014 I love ancient history, and of course it\u2019s instrumental if you want to understand how the world and humanity has developed. So Ancient Egypt and Ancient Sumeria and the Indus Valley civilizations and Ancient China have always been super interesting to me, and so China\u2019s always had an extremely rich and extremely ancient culture, and a highly developed one! And they were kind of isolated from the world for a large part of their history, but as far as they were concerned, they were top dog for most of their history. They had the most highly advanced civilization that they knew of, and you could make the case that it was! Ancient Chinese history and Chinese culture pre-20th Century is extremely rich and fascinating. So I just looked at it and said, Look, 1.3 Billion people, the geography and the natural resources to support it. They had a difficult time in the 20th Century, a lot of tumult and changes, but things were coalescing into a more organized and efficient state now. And I remember when I first went there, everyone was like, Ah, they\u2019ll never do anything but copy American or European goods \u2014 they\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019re a different breed! I\u2019m like, What are you talking about? We\u2019re all just people responding to our environment! There\u2019s no difference between a Chinese person, an American person, an African person, in what they\u2019re capable of as a human being! It\u2019s all just them responding to their environment and their incentives and all that kind of stuff. So to me it was very clear that China\u2019s story was gonna continue to unfold, and with a population like that and as they became increasingly rich and with the natural resources they had and with a proud legacy of being an advanced dominant civilization in the world prior to the 20th Century, I just felt like that was gonna be the natural order of things! Ultimately I know in the current geopolitical dynamic you may say like, Yeah but the US military is like way way bigger! It\u2019s like, Yeah, well, so is the Spanish military and the Portuguese and the British and the fill in the blank, fill in the blank, fill in the blank. They have a billion more people than the US! They have a lot of space for them. They have resources in their own borders and of course they\u2019ve been going all over the world buying resources. They\u2019re extremely hungry and driven and motivated people. There are no more entrepreneurial, capitalist-minded people I\u2019ve ever come across in all my travels than Chinese people! And their structure of government is deserving of a lot of criticism especially from a freedom point of view, but one, I think a lot of Bitcoiners would be critical of the state apparatus in many jurisdictions. It\u2019s not like one\u2019s good, one\u2019s bad. It\u2019s like degrees of bad that we\u2019re talking about! [1:11:10] And as far as economic development is concerned, I\u2019m a critic of central planning and I think the best way to foster growth and innovation is as an emergent property of free markets, and perhaps their development would\u2019ve been better if they went that way \u2014 who knows \u2014 but I can\u2019t knock the fact that they\u2019ve just set the parameters of the game, and then pretty much let the natural entrepreneurial energy of the people play it, and then pour on some gasoline in different areas where they want to see more development. And I think based on that maybe there\u2019s bubbles forming, but I think the overarching story is: How could you stop that? And even if we go onto a Bitcoin standard where let\u2019s say the playing field is fair and even for all countries in the world \u2014 and now the kicker here is the US is getting a massive head start on the world presumably, at least as individuals, because Bitcoin is probably adopted more in the US than most other countries in the world! And that\u2019s awesome, because that\u2019s gonna be probably a huge determining factor in the future. I also suspect that the PBoC is actually and has been accumulating Bitcoin, but that\u2019s pure speculation. That\u2019s my own feeling about how they operate. But if the world is operating on an even playing field and people can\u2019t manipulate their currencies and it\u2019s strictly a matter of who produces the most and best things that the global market wants, I think China wins at that game ultimately! Now one of the things that may influence that that I\u2019m really excited about, because I don\u2019t like the prospect of any one massive country having a huge asymmetry of power in the world, I think the shift toward \u2014 umbrella term \u2014 the means of production shifting to a local basis, so with the advent of 3D printing and all the stuff we\u2019re seeing now: An individual can generate their own power, they can grow their own food, they can make their own tables and chairs. Like, we\u2019re not there yet but that seems to be the trend that production is coming down to the individual level! And I\u2019m sure there will be other things that people end up doing, but I\u2019m hoping that that brings the locus of power back to the individual and the efficiency gains of these massive states \u2014 these centrally controlled massive states that try to control economies \u2014 will diminish, and if that\u2019s the case, maybe that influences how the geopolitical winds blow and what changes take place. But if things kind of remain on the current trajectory, I mean I just think people, geography, level of wealth now, organization, I think it\u2019s just kind of natural that China will be dominant player in the future whether we like it or not!"}

And I\u2019m only gonna buttress that up to or contrast that to the fact that \u2014 and I didn\u2019t run the numbers on this, I\u2019m not an historical expert \u2014 but it seems like they moved to the gold standard a little slower than other nations, and that cost their civilization a lot of time, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get everything right! And I\u2019m just coming at this as an agnostic\u2014I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m just curious what you think! But do you think their locus of power comes from the history, or from the fact that they\u2019re more centralized planning? And maybe we could argue that there are other states that are just as centralized. And the notion of centralization. Or is it a combination of both? I\u2019m just curious what you think?"}

Like we just simply can\u2019t appreciate what the 20th Century was like for mainland Chinese people. Like, fill in your number: 50 Million, 100 Million, dead of starvation under Mao, right? And then the Cultural Revolution where all that stuff about the past \u2014 because they felt like the world had become modern and they had lagged behind, and so the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d was basically: Do away with history, all of that tradition, that\u2019s holding us back! We\u2019ve gotta modernize and move forward! And so they destroyed ancient monuments and they tried to basically destroy the culture so that nobody would be focusing on that, and everyone would be aligned on moving forward. And you know, under that form of communism \u2014 and that was horrible, the society at that time\u2014and when I went there in 2009 and probably today in certain pockets but increasingly rare, but when I went there in 2009 you could still see vestiges of like the abject poverty and the kind of toll it took on people\u2019s mentality, to the point that now, still, the cultural mentality of the people is like, it\u2019s a bit weird! If you\u2019re under 40 that\u2019s less and less the case, but there\u2019s still a generation of people alive today, people that are 40+ that experienced a lot of that stuff. So on the one hand they know that they had this glorious past, this rich culture, but they also know that it was basically shaken out of them! And so now the nation identity \u2014 I mean they\u2019re very nationalistic people. Obviously they propagandize and all that kind of stuff, but like, basically they think this is China reascending. And the opportunity is right there in front of \u2019em and they want to get after it both for themselves and for \u201cthe glory of the nation\u201d. And so that\u2019s how people feel! And for younger people \u2014 and to kind of answer the question about how I feel it\u2019ll shake out \u2014 regardless of central planning and government structure and Bitcoin and fiat currency and whatever, the people under 40 that I knew in China, and it was pretty consistent this way, was: I meet them and you could see it in their eyes that they\u2019re curious about the world, right? They want to learn about the world, they want to travel, they want to educate themselves, they want to dress well, they want to kick ass in their chosen field. Like they\u2019re a really well put together people that are focused on \u2014 eyes on the prize, right? They know that a better life awaits, they know the opportunity, they want to get after it! Because it\u2019s been held back from them for so long! Versus, on the Western World, obviously as a result of having had it for so long there\u2019s an element of complacency \u2014 obviously in varying degrees to different people \u2014 and I hate to be too critical of our culture, but a big portion of the culture goes to work so they can come home and watch Netflix and chill out on the sofa until it\u2019s time to go to bed. Like there\u2019s not much drive beyond doing what is necessary to get by! And in China, honestly man, like that\u2019s why cities like Shanghai and Beijing and Shenzhen have such a strong energy, because everyone is after it really hard! And that\u2019s a tough thing to beat! Like people will work their goddamn asses off! It doesn\u2019t matter what the job. Like there is just such a hustle and bustle there! And I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s gonna stop anytime soon. So I think that\u2019ll feed into the economic and geopolitical dynamic that plays out."}

It\u2019s a great insight! Before we turn to your awesome article, After An Unforgettable Year, I\u2019m Most Bullish on Bitcoiners, I really want to bring up another article that you\u2019ve published on Twitter, it was just a great post. This was on December 16th: Just fuck me already, Bitcoin! John, this broke me! I didn\u2019t see it on December 16th, I was researching you, I went down your timeline, this just absolutely floored me. I think this took absolute balls and chutzpah to post! I\u2019m a married man, my wife would throw me out of the house if I posted this! But I want to know what you were getting at? What feeling were you trying to capture?"}

And I mean you know when you\u2019re a younger man perhaps and you\u2019re doing this traveling around the world, you come across the odd lady and you know there\u2019s an element of playfulness and teasing and stuff. And you know maybe we\u2019ve all been in a situation where like the foreplay is done and you want to get on with it! And I think that Tweet in particular was obviously spoken from the female side of things if we\u2019re gonna frame it up that way. But no it was like, Bitcoin had been flirting with the all-time high like, C\u2019mon let\u2019s go! And what\u2019s funny about that Tweet is I don\u2019t think it was long after, but things really rocketed up after that one, which is why I think it became kind of a funny Tweet because it seemed like it was speaking to the gods of Bitcoiners, speaking to Satoshi or something like that!"}

So I\u2019m gonna ask you: Why are you so bullish on Bitcoiners?"}

And we shape our tools and we are shaped by our tools. So the story here is the changes in behavior, the changes in the methods and ways in which we interact with one another, and in which we interact with our future selves of course. That\u2019s the story here! That\u2019s the phenomenon! The attention gets placed on Bitcoin obviously because it\u2019s the novel tool that\u2019s emerged to let all this happen, but we are the story here, and the changes that happen in people as a result of this tool emerging and obviously importantly using this tool to maximum effect, to its maximum potential, the effects it has on individuals and the community that it creates \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the phenomenon! How could it be any other way? Bitcoin is just a nothingburger if we don\u2019t use it and engage with it to actually interact in novel ways. And so that\u2019s kind of what I was getting at with that article, and the fact that I\u2019ve just been \u2014 I guess as a result of that being true or as proof that that is true \u2014 I\u2019ve had the good fortune to interact with so many Bitcoiners through the podcast and through other means and hearing the stories of genuine transformation! And irregardless of age, sex, creed, nationality, whatever \u2014 I often come back to the example of Michael Saylor: It can\u2019t just be the fact that people are getting wealthier as a result of owning Bitcoin and the price going up, because here\u2019s a guy who was already extremely wealthy, and once he went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole like it\u2019s very apparent all over his face and his \u2014 you know? You can tell that this guy was changed by this thing! I think he was probably \u2014 we were discussing before, like \u2014 a bit of aimlessness, a bit of despair as a result of thinking, Is this it? Is this all there is, world, that you\u2019ve got for me? And then having this thing emerge and having the world expand as a result of this thing emerging, right? Our worlds have expanded dramatically as a result of this new tool! And people seem to be changing in dramatic and consistent ways as a result of the emergence of that tool. And going back to that phenomenon of our tools shaping us. And it was also going back to what I was saying about the psychedelic \u2014 you know, when I was kind of hanging my hat on the capacity for [the] psychedelic, or the change in consciousness or mindset to change the world, you know there was no real tool to foster that en masse. And with Bitcoin now I think we have one! By whatever means you come in, Number Go Up or the community or sovereignty or protecting from inflation or whatever, I think if you stay with it, like if you pay enough attention to it, it starts to change you! I mean this is the very consistent message in the community: Bitcoin changes you! [1:24:57] And I\u2019m so stoked by the type of changes that I see in people! And to a certain degree I\u2019ve seen in myself! That\u2019s how the world gets better, is people! Upgrade people\u2014upgrade the world. We always say, Fix the money, fix the world. But it really is: Upgrade people, upgrade the world, because that\u2019s all the world is. It\u2019s just us here on this rock. And I\u2019ve met so many \u2014 I can\u2019t say it enough man. I\u2019ve had very good fortune to have very good friends and relationships in my life: family and friends and stuff. I\u2019ve got a lot of love in my life. But it\u2019s definitely been the case that I\u2019ve always been a bit of a \u2014 felt somewhat isolated intellectually let\u2019s say. And now to see all these people from all over the world having kind of a simultaneous awakening, and like I was saying earlier \u2014 I mean I could just pick up the phone and talk to them like we\u2019ve known each other for 10 years \u2014 kind of like what we\u2019re doing right now, as a result of the seemingly consistent changes that this thing engenders in people, is nothing short of amazing! So both on a larger macro scale of seeing these positive changes in individuals, but also on a selfish individual scale saying like, Man, the number of people that I feel connected to now has grown exponentially, has exploded as a result of Bitcoin and my involvement in it! And I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of Bitcoiners! The connection, again back to that despair component, that\u2019s one of the things that make human beings happy, is genuine connection with other human beings! And the fact that Bitcoin is fostering that with like, a lot of other people, is amazing! And I think we\u2019re just starting to see the effects."}

And the instant vibe, and I think that speaks to \u2014 I stopped making connections like this when I graduated college. And pre-graduating college my world was guaranteed in terms of I just did what I had to do and everything was paid for in terms of either loans or financial assistance from my parents. And then I was out on my own and the world was running away from me and it was a lot harder to connect to people in an unfair world where no one has time to spend on each other! But like I said before: I think you\u2019re the dopest, freshest Bitcoiner in my mind this year. We all have longstanding people that have influenced us and we really relate to or gleaned a lot from, but in this past year of my exploring \u2014 especially as a podcaster \u2014 there\u2019s no one I want to hear more than you!

And we got this new thing up around here now which is Bitcoin Clubhouse. And I have mixed feelings about Bitcoin Clubhouse \u2014 not bad \u2014 but like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like going to the opera, it\u2019s not a polished show, it\u2019s not a one-on-one, deep heavy conversation, but I like the fire, I like the ephemeral spontaneity, I like the ability to connect. And I think you were in there for the first time yesterday, but I did get to hear you in the Peter Schiff room, and I\u2019m not trying to get into the Peter Schiff thing too much, but I just loved hearing you. But I also just really enjoyed your questions to him, and so I\u2019ll speak it out a little bit from what I remember, I\u2019ll paraphrase. So you asked him, Peter, what would it take for you to understand and/or admit that other people know something you don\u2019t? Or understand something you don\u2019t? And he gibber-gabbered and didn\u2019t really answer that question and I appreciated the fact that you said that that doesn\u2019t really answer the question. But I want to know from you, what did you take from that interaction? What did you take from that? Did you enjoy that interaction?"}

I was just in the audience listening to it all go down. But look, we all feel the same about Peter, right? He\u2019s out of his goddamn mind! There\u2019s no convincing him, clearly! So I didn\u2019t want to go in with something like, How can you say intrinsic value? We all know value is subjective! Or something like that, because none of that plays with Peter. So I tried to ask a question that maybe got away from speaking past each other on specific terms and stuff like that. I knew he would do his typical thing and route around it. But I just kind of wanted to hear him admit, and I think he did kind of show his hand, because I said, What would it take for you to \u2014 I said something about ego and hubris and if you really want to learn we have to engage in discourse where we genuinely allow for the possibility that the person we\u2019re speaking with might understand something that we don\u2019t? I mean what is the point of the conversation if you\u2019re not gonna grant that to the person you\u2019re speaking with? And his answer was, Yeah but what is it that I don\u2019t know? And I think everyone in the audience \u2014 you know? Exactly! That exactly characterizes his entire perspective and his approach to this. I think maybe in hindsight a better question would have been simply like, Have you ever read cover-to-cover a book about Bitcoin? And I think his answer would be No. And I think it would be great to say to him like, You\u2019re speaking from a position of presumed authority on this subject and there\u2019s a certain cohort of people that actually value your opinion and are listening to you as if you are educated on the subject, and if you haven\u2019t even taken any time to educate yourself on the subject when anyone in this space will tell you that it takes a lot of self-education to really come to understand what this thing is \u2014 I mean every Bitcoin that I talk to is like, Half my day is trying to continue to try to understand and learn about this thing! And certainly when you first got into it you were probably set on fire and just consumed every resource you could get your hands on. And for you not to do that but still presume to speak from a position of authority is a profound moral failing on your part! And so if I had my time back I maybe would\u2019ve went that route, but I think at this point and for a long time, the only reason why I don\u2019t get a ton of enjoyment out of it is because I don\u2019t like that people are being misguided by his opinion, but as far as entertainment value, I kind of love that he\u2019s around! That he\u2019s just this irrational holdout that\u2019s kind of never gonna capitulate that we can kind of just use as a punching bag for fun as we march towards hyperbitcoinization. And it makes the process fun. This isn\u2019t all serious at the end of the day. No good revolution doesn\u2019t have some fun mixed into it, and this is a revolution. And us Bitcoiners gotta get our kick somewhere and I think Peter Schiff is probably one of them!"}

They\u2019re sovereign! Like when they are sovereign, you can say what you want and not be afraid of the consequences. But I\u2019m hoping that what comes from that among other things is that people will both develop better principles and values internally, and will hold people to account more to \u2014 will judge people more on their principles and values rather than just their position or their wealth or whatever. And so I do think we see that in Bitcoin Twitter where sure you can be successful, you can be rich, you can be whatever, but if you\u2019re caught being disingenuous, being dishonest, promoting something that\u2019s totally self-serving or all these things, people get called out! And I love that! I want to see more of that! And I think Bitcoin is a great tool for that as well because it kind of shines a spotlight on bullshit and I think someone like Peter Schiff \u2014 that\u2019s kind of why I asked that question \u2014 because it is a moral issue that you don\u2019t engage in conversation as though the person you\u2019re speaking to had anything from which you could learn! Right? To presume that your knowledge is complete \u2014 that\u2019s a moral failing! And I hope that as we become more sovereign, our lips become looser, but our conviction and our principles and our values become stronger, and we hold people to account more on those variables, not on the typical ones of status and wealth and that kind of stuff. And I see that that\u2019s what happens now in the very small Bitcoin Twitter community, and I\u2019m hoping that that proliferates further."}

And always getting worse! And no one was hearing it. No one was waking up to it. And to be honest I think it\u2019s gonna take a generation and a half for people to recognize and reflect on Bitcoin and change their behavior en masse. You know? I think we\u2019re a select \u2014 not a select few like we\u2019re special, I\u2019m not trying to say we\u2019re special \u2014but we\u2019re early, is what I mean. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permeating as quickly\u2014even if people make gains\u2014what this thing is, that it\u2019s this tool, that it could change their behavior, that it will change their behavior! But I do think that they will be forced to change their behavior, and that it will take a generation and a half. It will take our children and even our children will be subjected to what their parents think of for the last 5 years and the next 5 years. And I don\u2019t think everyone\u2019s coming around very quickly. Most people think of it still as Magic Internet Money, Super Mario coins, it\u2019s not real. They don\u2019t see their dollars shrinking or they get stocks and the stocks go up 20% a year and that\u2019s good enough, even though that\u2019s keeping up with inflation. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith. Again I\u2019m an eternal optimist, I think it\u2019s going to work out! I think we now have the tool to solve this problem for ourselves, but I think it\u2019s gonna take a long time for it to affect people en masse. But that being said, for me it\u2019s been eye-opening because I now feel freedom that I\u2019ve never felt before! A freedom that comes from being able to grasp something that I couldn\u2019t get in my hands before and now I have it. And no one can take it away from me metaphorically \u2014 I could lose it, I could spend it, but no one can take it from me! No one could debase it! And that\u2019s a really big deal! So now I\u2019m an eternal optimist but I\u2019m a little bit more inwardly pessimistic about everyone getting on board. But now I\u2019m very optimistic for myself \u2014 I\u2019ve got the keys in my hand! And before this I was afraid that I would never get the keys in my hand, that it would always be out of my reach and that I would always have to do someone else\u2019s bidding to get there. Now the bidding is my own."}

And I mean I think we all try to manage our expectations on this stuff so that we\u2019re not disappointed how fast we progress, but I will say that freedom is at first scary and then it\u2019s intoxicating! And that\u2019s been my experience, because freedom is the assumption of responsibility, right? So I think that at first is very scary, people are not used to that. But once you do it and you get comfortable with it, then you just want to do it everywhere. You get addicted to that sense of freedom and sovereignty. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I think once this narrative really breaks through like what\u2019s happening in the macro landscape and what Bitcoin represents, I can see scenarios where it happens way quicker than we all might expect. But I do try to remind myself that as is often said in this space, The future is here it\u2019s just not evenly distributed, but another way I look at it is: Everything is always in flux. There is no stasis. So when I try to imagine a future point in time where the Bitcoin Renaissance is well under way, I try not to look at reality in terms of where we are as a static current moment and where we will be at a static future moment. Like, it will always be underway! There will always be more things we\u2019re striving for, more things that are changing. And that\u2019s just the way it is. So when I think about, When will this happen? When will it be adopted? When will people change? Well the answer is some people \u2014 and a growing number of people \u2014 are actually having that transformation now! And that\u2019s awesome! And look at this great community that\u2019s growing up as a result of it. Other people it\u2019ll take them another 5 years and then they\u2019ll come in, another 10 years, another 50 years, you know? So we don\u2019t want everything to be the same everywhere at the same time, right? And that could never be the case anyways! And I think that\u2019s maybe an outlook that allows you to be a little bit more accepting of the ups and downs and the unexpected things that the flow of time throws at you, because you\u2019re kind of like, I\u2019m not gonna hang all of my hopes and dreams on some imagined reality coming to pass in the future. Because there\u2019s getting there anyways! I\u2019ll just be passing through that place if it even happens at all. [1:44:49] That\u2019s why speaking about values and principles and this journey that we\u2019ve both seen when we were younger of just trying to find ourselves and find meaning and understand the world, I think part of the reason we do that is because we know that there\u2019s something inside of us, and perhaps in that realm of things, that can be immutable and unchanging, right? Like, that I know who I\u2019m gonna be and the principles that are gonna guide me and the values I\u2019m gonna hold, irrespective of the circumstances that surround me! And there\u2019s something really liberating about that, because it\u2019s saying that no matter what happens in the world, no matter what happens in my environment, those things are still my anchor, those are me. And I think that\u2019s powerful and in a way that maybe I can\u2019t explain right now, but it gives you a sense of comfort maybe about the chaos of the external world, and having a North Star to guide you through all of that. And maybe that\u2019s part of the function that religion has served in the past, and maybe that\u2019s part of the reason, the motivation behind spiritual seeking and that sort of stuff, but I think that\u2019s one of the main benefits of taking the time or being on a continuous journey of self-understanding and refinement, is finding those things about yourself that you kind of know are immutable and unchanging, and using them to give you some level of comfort about the uncertainty of the future and the world around you."}

I think I have a two-part answer to that: One is, that\u2019s a question that I kind of \u2014 and maybe we all \u2014 obsess over as we go through life, that we want to have some idea of what the future holds and what the best use of our time is and what\u2019s gonna make us feel the best about life in general. And I think this has been largely a result of Bitcoin. I don\u2019t think I answered earlier when you asked me what specific behaviors have changed in me as a result of Bitcoin, but I think part of it is letting go into kind of a faith that if you can just show up as yourself with your genuine curiosity and not be afraid to speak the truth and connect with like-minded people that you think are good people and you wanna connect with \u2014 like if you do that and you have a faith to push into that, then I kind of feel like the result of that is the best you could hope for! So I could say like, Well I want to be the head of a billion-dollar media company in 20 years. But that\u2019s just arbitrary! Like, that\u2019s just giving an answer. And I\u2019m starting to realize that the best thing for me to follow internally is what gives me energy when I do it! What feels right! What aligns with my principles. What do I really enjoy doing? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m just beginning to understand how to interpret that and how to push into it. Because most of my life has been \u2014 I\u2019ve always been a bit spontaneous, but I\u2019ve tried to graft an imagined future onto my life in my past, and I think that\u2019s shifting a bit now to just saying, Look, I have a certain degree of freedom. I\u2019m really interested in certain things. I just wanna be myself and see what happens, basically! But a bit more of a detailed answer is: I love spending time with people \u2014 well I\u2019ll paint you my ideal scenario, and that\u2019ll probably \u2014 a picture says a thousand words. But at some point in the future, I\u2019d love to be in a natural environment, whether it\u2019s rural Canada, rural Mexico, rural Thailand, wherever, just a beautiful environment \u2014 mountains, beaches, lakes, rivers, that kind of thing \u2014 and have a place that\u2019s set up first of all for the things that I love to do. So I love to train Muay Thai and MMA and work out and go for swims and go for hikes and just be active and in nature and that kind of thing, and be with others who are just doing the same, because I love the vibe when you\u2019re doing something difficult together and then afterwards you hang out and you talk about how hard it was and the camaraderie there. And have it be an environment where people can come and have these peak experiences that I\u2019ve explored in the psychedelic realm. So basically combining health and fitness and wellness with these peak experiences that I think are incredibly beneficial and therapeutic to people. And then mic\u2019ing up and having whatever conversation we like to have! I mean you also asked me earlier why I interviewed Bobby the first time. And the answer is two-fold: One, his office was \u2014 I could see his office from my apartment window, it was right across the street. But the other answer is, even at that time it wasn\u2019t only Bitcoin-focused, but I was working in Shanghai and I was like, This is not enough! My job is not satisfying me, and the tech industry was really booming there at the time and really getting underway. And I liked that industry because I felt that it was solutions-oriented and it was building solutions to our problems instead of just complaining about things! And I was like, I\u2019m gonna reach out to these people and say, How about we record a chat? And that\u2019s a weird thing to do, and I got a lot of No\u2019s, but once I got the ball rolling and people realized I wasn\u2019t crazy, then I would get referrals from people and say, Do you know anybody else doing interesting stuff? And Bobby I think I hit him up individually and he referred me to some other people. But yeah man like what\u2019s better than hanging out with someone and feeling good and then mic\u2019ing up with no time horizon and saying like, What do you want to explore? Let\u2019s hit it! Let\u2019s go deep in any direction and see what we come up with! And maybe we don\u2019t come up with anything novel and just connect, and maybe we do come up with something unique and we both learn something! You know that\u2019s kind of the ideal day for me. And of course family and all that kind of stuff, but yeah that\u2019s what the vision looks like right now. We\u2019ll see how it turns out. So I think that\u2019s a vague kind of goal, but the guiding force is just, We are all starting to have this opportunity where we really can experience what freedom and sovereignty is, and I think we should take advantage of that by allowing ourselves to be who we are and continue to try to understand what and who that is, and shove it out there in the world and see what happens!"}

I\u2019ve got a question for ya! So I started that [podcast] because like you said I wanted to do an open kind of conversation and then do some rapid-fire questions at the end just to kind of delve into people\u2019s minds, a bit of human interest. And it actually is kind of fun to hear how different people answer rapid-fire questions, although I\u2019ve given it up recently because I just more enjoy the open conversations. But lately if I\u2019m just having long-form discussions with people, like 2-hour discussions, then a podcast titled Rapid-Fire may be somewhat misleading or confusing! What\u2019s in a name for you?"}

I\u2019m looking to leave all this out of the chat, but like I think that it\u2019s confusing to me in the sense that \u2014 the title\u2019s not confusing to me \u2014 but the dilemma. Because it\u2019s like, do I get 30 minutes of this dude and sum it up? Or do I go the full 2-hours? You know? And I would probably put it into two separate channels, just because I don\u2019t think that one takes away from the other, but as someone who \u2014 I always want to go full-bore. Me personally. And that like Rapid-Fire I\u2019m like, Well maybe I could just cheat-code it! So it\u2019s a dilemma for me. But at the end of the day man I love what you\u2019re doing. I love both of \u2018em! And I don\u2019t care, I mean what do we care? If they want to they will listen to it. And you see the numbers, but like, I like the long form, for me. Because that\u2019s just more meaningful for me! And the short form has a purpose, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t, but if I see both maybe I\u2019ll jump on the short form and skip the long form, I don\u2019t know! But dude seriously, I really just want to hear you everywhere! I don\u2019t even want to hear you interview people, and I love your interviews. But I love hearing you and what your thoughts are! And I think that\u2019s really hard to get that across in an interview because you could share, but I just want to hear you speak. I think that you have a really interesting perspective on this outside of money, you know? You\u2019re on that philosophical bent! What is this doing for us? Because at the end of the day it\u2019s a tool, and it\u2019s just a tool! It\u2019s maybe the greatest tool we\u2019ve ever invented, but I don\u2019t know, maybe fire is! Maybe the printing press is. Maybe the Internet is. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna play out over the next 5,000 years, what made one thing more important than the other. I mean you can\u2019t have Bitcoin probably without the Internet. But the Internet without Bitcoin is not much the way it\u2019s gone! So I don\u2019t know! But I love hearing you talk about things, I love the way you ask questions, I thought the way you cut into Schiff was gold! I\u2019m done with him now! I was done with him for a while, but I was like, Yep after John asked that question, there\u2019s no more! It\u2019s pointless until he\u2019s willing to acknowledge the question you\u2019re actually asking! And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing all day long! So I\u2019m just enamored with you. We didn\u2019t get into a lot of things, but you live in Thailand, you\u2019re in Newfoundland now, you\u2019re from there, you can\u2019t get home. You\u2019re a wanderer but you\u2019re settling down. I think it\u2019s wild man, and I\u2019m so glad we connected. I really enjoyed our conversation and I just want to hear more from you! Clubhouse is a different animal, because it\u2019s more talk radio and it\u2019s more new to experts, and once in a while these experts get into expert conversations about different topics and I love the combination of people there. But at the end of the day it\u2019s not as fulfilling to me. It\u2019s kind of like Reality TV. I could jump in and just waste some time there. I go there to veg out actually. To listen to other people to be entertained. I don\u2019t go there to share my thoughts because I\u2019m just happy to hear everyone else\u2019s! And I was happy to hear you get the opportunity to ask Peter a real question in a live format that he couldn\u2019t sidestep without his own words and edit out. So that was dope. So I just want to hear you everywhere, I loved your article in Bitcoin Magazine, I liked your take on things, I\u2019m just so happy we got to connect."}

You get to dial in with a person or a group of people and you really get to take the conversation somewhere! Like I\u2019m doing one with Breedlove and Richard James next week and it\u2019s looking at Jordan Peterson\u2019s book Maps of Meaning and we\u2019re just going to explore that book and relate it to Bitcoin in various degrees, and that\u2019s the stuff that I really enjoy! Because like I said about my future, I\u2019d love it if that could be part of my day, these intellectual conversations where we kind of ask the big questions and try to foil around and fumble around with them! And try to use each other to help refine them for ourselves. I mean that\u2019s what gets me off. So the social media domain is fun and we like to have fun there and banter and other stuff, but I love this and man I couldn\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate, one, the work that you\u2019re doing \u2014 I love your work as well, and also for having me on for this chat, it\u2019s been awesome!"}

Today is another deep episode. We\u2019re actually getting towards the end of the line here and covering some of the last ground in the macroeconomic domain and tying it back actually to some philosophy towards the end. Today we\u2019re going to talk a bit about how Bitcoin is an elemental innovation, tying us back to Episode 1 where we discussed Stone Age technologies including Fire, Water, and Missiles. We\u2019re making the case that Bitcoin is an elemental invention akin to one of these Stone Age technologies. Which as a reminder if you haven\u2019t seen those prior episodes I highly recommend you go check those out because they build a long and strong intellectual edifice to get us to this point. Secondly we\u2019re gonna talk about fiat currency and how it\u2019s a contaminated form of money that leads to socioeconomic decay. And we\u2019re gonna go into interest rates, an area that\u2019s commonly misunderstood by even people that are typically considered financially sophisticated. Then we\u2019re gonna talk a bit about central bank price manipulation, how that influences markets. We\u2019re also gonna talk about market competition and the law of decimation and how that plays out in nature and throughout history. Then we\u2019re gonna get into the philosophical domain, and we\u2019re gonna touch on a bit of Stoicism and how Saylor has used this in his own life and how he sees its importance in markets in general. Finally we\u2019ll leave off with a bit of discussion on antifragility and the vitality of life. So I\u2019m excited for this one, another crazy episode with the incredibly brilliant Michael Saylor. So with that let\u2019s dive in!"}

It\u2019s how we\u2019ve developed everything, essentially! And I\u2019m reminded of a quote by Alfred North Whitehead that I\u2019ll paraphrase. He said that it\u2019s common wisdom for people to say you should think before you act, but that in fact civilization advances by us being able to execute more important operations without having to think about them! So we\u2019re actually \u2014 when we can embed these certain important actions in a protocol that we don\u2019t need to think about as much, it frees us up to do other things \u2014 that\u2019s kind of the layers upon which we\u2019ve built civilization. It just seems like this Digital Age we\u2019re going into is something radically new! It seems to be as profound as the Renaissance, or as profound as the Enlightenment! Do you see it that way? Are we co-evolving with the tools that we\u2019re creating and that the next 500 years are gonna be something so fundamentally different than what history has been that it will be difficult to recognize it in a few hundred years?"}

Maybe one interesting thing is just the science of sterilization. Germs \u2014 modern medicine and the awareness and the importance of sterilizing instruments and the way that the disease spreads! Immunology. Once we figured that out, we were able to go from living 50 years to living 70 years because we realized that every time we entered into a medical procedure including the birth of a child, we were entering into a non-sterile environment that was life-threatening, soul-sucking, life-stealing. The death rate from childbirth was huge, right? The average life expectancy was short, and we needed that breakthrough to realize that we were swimming in germs, and the very simple solution is: Wash your hands! Sterilize your instruments! And you put that together with antibiotics and human life expectancy jumps by 50%! What if we\u2019re actually doing economics with dirty money? And so we\u2019ve been using monetary energy which is bleeding, right? It\u2019s the same way as operating with non-sterile instruments, and the patient keeps dying and we don\u2019t know why. The significance of Bitcoin is: We\u2019re going from defective money, which is somewhere between toxic \u2014 it may just been ineffective, bleeding 2, 3, 4% a year\u2014or it\u2019s toxic when it gets to -10% or -15% real yield. So using toxic money, how is that different than using toxic instruments when I commit surgery on you? How is it different than feeding you toxic food? I think we\u2019re breaking through this new world, we sterilize our instruments, we encrypt our money, we\u2019re moving to a science of non-toxic economic energy. Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning. She died of cancer from the radiation. They didn\u2019t realize that radiation killed you, that it caused cancer. There\u2019s a lot of basics in life that we don\u2019t understand. A big breakthrough in health was when we realized that sugar was toxic. My mother didn\u2019t know that sugar was toxic! Conventional wisdom and governmental advice was you need your four favorite food groups and pursue a low-fat diet but starch and sugar was fine. And of course now we know that too much starch and too much sugar makes you insulin-resistant, makes you Type-2 diabetic, gives you cancer. My mother became diabetic, became overweight, got cancer. We thought it was just unfortunate. The doctors said, We don\u2019t know why these things are happening, it\u2019s just unfortunate. If I could go back in time I\u2019d be like, I know exactly why it happens! I know exactly how to solve it now! Like, don\u2019t eat sugar, don\u2019t eat starch \u2014 stop eating! Fast! I never eat before 1 in the afternoon, I only eat in an 8-hour window and I\u2019ll go 2\u20133 days and I won\u2019t eat. I adopt fasting and I won\u2019t drink anything with sugar in it. You want to live a long time, don\u2019t dose yourself with sugar, it\u2019s toxic! The instruments are toxic. The germs are toxic. We killed George Washington \u2014 we bled him to death! Toxic. The money is toxic. That\u2019s fundamentally the issue. The money is toxic. I mean, that\u2019s the fundamental issue with inflation, and if we segue into the discussion of inflation, everybody keeps thinking there is no inflation because everybody focuses upon a market basket of consumer goods. And if you look in the US and you look in Europe, they leave food and energy out of the basket of consumer goods and they say, We left out the highly volatile food and energy from the index. Well highly volatile means it went up! [And if you put them in, 12:06] the number would change! Volatility in other words is the signal! We\u2019ve left out everything that actually changes in price from our price index. It literally is like a Jedi Mind Trick, and it\u2019s like a triple mind trick. It\u2019s like: We have a consumer price index and we\u2019ve left the prices that vary out of the index. We have a consumer price index \u2014 well first of all it\u2019s not a scalar, it\u2019s a vector. It\u2019s an indimensional vector dynamically changing in time \u2014 you\u2019ve just created a scalar. We\u2019ve created a market basket of things that we think you want. Yes, your basket is what I want! The market basket of things that you want does not include assets. No! I would never want to buy assets, only rich people buy assets! Poor people do not buy assets! How did poor people get rich? You have to buy assets to go from being poor to being rich. I didn\u2019t go from being poor to being wealthy by not buying assets or not creating assets \u2014 you create them or you buy them. So the entire field of inflation is defective, and the irony is that 99% of the economists that talk about it, they\u2019ve already accepted the notion that a market basket of consumer products and services is acceptable, and it\u2019s acceptable to throw out energy and good. And I\u2019ve never seen an economist say, Why don\u2019t we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is gonna want to buy by the time they\u2019re 32? And here\u2019s one thing: Early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time I\u2019m 32. How do I do that? I need to buy a bond that pays me $75,000 a year in interest risk-free, and I need for the $75,000 a year to pay my living expenses. And if the interest rate was 7% then I\u2019d need $1 Million for that. But if the interest rate goes to 0.7% I\u2019d need $10 Million for that. So from 2010 to 2020 the interest rate went down to 60 basis points on a 10-year government bond which meant that the bond went from $1 Million to $10 Million, which meant that the 22-year old was suffering from 22% inflation on early retirement! But because that\u2019s not in the basket \u2014because that\u2019s not something that you would ever want to give them \u2014 there\u2019s no inflation! You can actually track it and you can see that the inflation rate changes across a thousand different \u2014 if you just started with a simple principle: Inflation is a basket of products, services, or assets. If you just did that, that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of saying, Oh it\u2019s possible the Sun revolves around the Earth, it\u2019s possible the Earth revolves around the Sun \u2014 let\u2019s find out which! Has anybody ever asked the question whether or not the basket should include assets? Or products or services? No one\u2019s even questioning the most basic premise! It\u2019s pernicious rule of propaganda, and it\u2019s attributed to Joseph Goebbels in the Nazi regime who said \u2014 and it\u2019s also attributed to [Ogilvy 15:31], so maybe it\u2019s apocryphal \u2014 but he said, All of our focus groups show us and tell us we can\u2019t tell people what to think. But we can tell them what to think about! I cannot change your mind once you\u2019ve made it up\u2014and if you have an opinion \u2014 but I can get you to focus upon something. So if I just keep saying inflation, CPI, and it didn\u2019t go up and this is what it is\u2014When\u2019s the last time 100 Million people said, What we really wanted to buy was early retirement? I didn\u2019t even know that was a product I could buy! Because I couldn\u2019t conceive of it! Well it is a product you can buy: It\u2019s a government 30-year bond that yields 6% interest in a non-inflationary environment \u2014 that\u2019s a risk-free retirement. You can buy that! Right now, the problem is at 140 basis points that would cost you $30 Million for $60,000 a year. How do I make that at $75,000 a year salary saving $15,000? If I\u2019m making $500,000 a year and I save $100,000\u2014you know, I pay $200,000 in tax, I make $300,000, I save $100,000 \u2014 if I save $100,000 for 20 years I\u2019ve got $2 Million, and investing that in a government bond at 60 basis points or 100 basis points, you get nothing! [17:07] So the problem starts with the fact that inflation is misdefined. The right way to think about it is: Every single product, service, or asset has an inflation co-efficient. And the inflationary co-efficient, that\u2019s the rate at which the price will change as I pump fiat into the money system. And so the co-efficients vary, and they\u2019re a function of the scarcity of the asset, the demand of the asset, the information content of the asset, the material cost or the variable cost of the asset, and then the modularity of the asset. If I can stamp out the asset a million times out of a factory, it\u2019s gonna be less inflationary because the fixed cost is higher and the variable cost is lower. Mobile phones will not be inflationary because everything\u2019s in the fab. Software will not be inflationary because there\u2019s no variable cost. Streaming music on Amazon Music or Apple Music will not be inflationary because I can stream it a billion times. A Picasso will be inflationary because there\u2019s only 20, 50, 100. The best 5 acres of beachfront property in the middle of Miami Beach will be inflationary to the extent people want Miami Beach. 5 acres in Ohio will not be inflationary because there\u2019s a lot of land in the world. The only land people want is in the middle of New York, the middle of London, the Hamptons, Miami Beach, the middle of LA, the middle of San Francisco, the middle of Tokyo. You fly across this country and look down, there\u2019s enough land to park 10 Billion people on 5 acres each! It\u2019s just gotta be in demand and scarce."}

So the co-efficient itself in my mind would be a product of the scarcity of the good or service relative to the scarcity of the money it\u2019s denominated in, such that if the money supply is outpacing the production of the good or service, that good or service would inflate in price, right? So to your point it\u2019s not a single variable \u2014 it\u2019s not CPI is inflation \u2014 everything has its own inflation rate. The second part of that question would be: Why is the narrative surrounding inflation so distorted? Do you think it\u2019s intentional by governments that are clearly heavily indebted? I don\u2019t see any equitable benefit to inflation whatsoever, it\u2019s purely a mechanism for reallocating wealth, and I don\u2019t understand why the narrative\u2019s so distorted!"}

Let\u2019s say there\u2019s $50 Trillion worth of energy and I blow $10 Trillion worth of money in the system. So there\u2019s still $50 Trillion worth of energy, but now the money is diluted by 20%, right? So if I have a product and I can measure the pure energy content of the product, then if it\u2019s 100% pure energy, the price has gotta go up by 20% if I expand the money supply by 20% assuming it\u2019s completely liquid and in demand.

This is why proof of work in Bitcoin is [inaudible 21:36]. If it takes me a tangible amount of energy to produce that thing then it\u2019s inflation co-efficient is going to be like 100%. And on the other hand, the cost to produce a streaming YouTube video, the energy content is 1% of the value added or the value of use. And 99% of the value-in-use is information and non-scarce information. So it\u2019s got a variable cost of 1%. An iPhone\u2019s got a variable cost of 30, 35, 40%. Everything\u2019s got a different variable cost. Gold\u2019s got a much higher variable cost, right? Because it\u2019s holding its energy. So when you look at all these things you\u2019ll be able to calculate different inflation co-efficients and therefore different inflation rates across an array of thousands of things. It\u2019d be different inflation rates in New York City, Manhattan versus farmland in Kansas. It\u2019d be different! So you can\u2019t really say, Oh this asset class. There will be different inflation rates on different stocks. You notice that if the cash flows are likely to continue from the stock, or less affected by inflation, then it\u2019s gonna go up. So I think the pernicious mistake everybody makes is: They don\u2019t really think about energy density and information density of their products, services, and assets. They\u2019re not applying conservation of energy. If the law of conservation of energy applies, when I increase the money supply by 20% and if the energy is constant, then all of the numbers have to change. And if they didn\u2019t change on the deflationary products, they must have changed more on something else! So you can\u2019t very well be printing 10% more money and not have the inflation. It\u2019s just: We\u2019re choosing to pick just 1% of the things that are inflated \u2014 the deflationary assets we put them in a bucket. And it\u2019s almost too easy. If I get to throw out all assets, all real estate, all stocks, all bonds, and then I get to throw out energy, and then I get to throw away food, well how could you possibly generate inflation? Because you could print a hundred-kazillion-trillion-billion dollars and the cost of free, streaming Twitter and YouTube is not going up!"}

The great majority of people, not only do they not think there\u2019s inflation, you literally have politicians lamenting that they can\u2019t create inflation and how important it is to create inflation, even as they\u2019re inflating every scarce asset on Earth to the point where no one can afford \u2014 look, Robert, like, I\u2019m a rich man! I\u2019m a very wealthy man! I can\u2019t afford to buy a house in the Hamptons! Like I\u2019ll go look at these things and I\u2019m like, Who\u2019s paying $47 Million? They\u2019re selling houses for $25 Million on 2 acres! I\u2019m like, Are you guys out of your minds? Or you go to New York City and someone\u2019s paying $25 Million for a 5,000 square foot apartment. $5,000 a square foot! At the end of the day, it\u2019s obscene. And what you can see is: We\u2019re running 10\u201320% inflation for the past decade, we\u2019re just running it on all of the scarce luxury assets that have high energy value. I mean, what\u2019s the definition of scarce, right? Maybe the definition of scarce is that it has high energy value, because if I could stamp out a billion-trillion of \u2019em for the same unit of energy I must be diluting the energy down, right?"}

It\u2019s like I\u2019m burning myself to death and I\u2019m calculating the temperature on the counter 6 feet away and I\u2019m burning but I need to keep turning the thermostat down. And I guess it\u2019s like they\u2019re just not feeling the pain. And because of that it takes us to the issue of interest, right? If you think inflation is not coming so you keep printing money and you keep driving the interest rate down, the problem we have is really just a war on currency, a war on time, we render the money toxic if you hold the money. Once you understand that the real inflation rate is 10\u201315% because that\u2019s how the assets were [clocking 28:10], then you realize that any currency you\u2019re holding is draining energy from your life at 10% a year. It\u2019s almost like I put in a battery that drains 1\u20132% a month. I can\u2019t store energy! You know another metaphor for what happens in the human body when you can\u2019t store energy? It\u2019s like, Robert if I took you and I dropped you in the middle of the Arctic Circle and it was 20 below, your body would start losing energy at a rapid rate, you\u2019d freeze to death. It\u2019s literally like I come into your office and I crank the temperature down 20 degrees and I\u2019m freezing you to death because I\u2019m pulling the energy off your skin. And so what do you do? Insulate, cover up, right? But what if you can\u2019t? If you\u2019re a wealthy person you put on a fur coat, right? Or maybe you\u2019re smart enough to realize: What do wealthy people do? You drop them in the Arctic and they get on their jet and they fly to the Caribbean where it\u2019s warm because they can! And what do you do if you\u2019re poor? I drop you in the Arctic, or even worse I go to your hometown and I just turn the temperature down to 20 below and you can\u2019t leave! But you know it\u2019s like I slowly freeze you to death. I don\u2019t do it fast. You don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s happening if it happened at a gradual enough rate. It\u2019s like, I know I\u2019m working hard I\u2019m just not getting ahead. I\u2019m working hard but I\u2019m not getting ahead, because every time I put money in the bank the price of everything keeps going up. The price of a house in Miami Beach it was $1 Million on the street where I live, and then it\u2019s 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, $10 Million. I\u2019m not talking about every decade, I\u2019m talking about every year! I\u2019m talking 2000\u20132010 during that administration we were printing money so fast that we had this housing boom and everybody that owned houses were happy \u2014 they\u2019re refinancing their houses \u2014 but you look at it and you\u2019re like, How is it possible that people bought this house in 1998 for $1 Million and I\u2019m being asked to pay $10 Million for the same house? If you happen to be working for cash \u2014 it\u2019s what Pomp would say \u2014 if you\u2019re working for cash and paying taxes and then you\u2019re putting the cash in the bank, then you\u2019re suffering from inflation \u2014"}

No one would dare say we have a negative real yield of -10%, it would create a panic! But if you did think negative real yield of -10%, what happens next? You cycle through and you say, Well, if my cash flows of the stock aren\u2019t going up by more than 10%, that\u2019s diluted. The only equity you can buy where you\u2019re gonna make out on is where the company\u2019s able to grow its cash flows more than 10% a year, right? And then you gotta buy it at a decent price. So if your cash flows are growing 20\u201330% a year maybe it\u2019s good deal. That\u2019s why people like tech like Facebook or Google or Amazon because they did for a while! I don\u2019t know if they will going forward. It\u2019s a lot harder, over the next 36 months it seems much less likely that you\u2019ll see 20% cash flows. Will you see 10%? I don\u2019t \u2014 what percentage of the S&P 500 will grow cash flows more than 10% this year? Any? 5%? 10%? Probably not more than 10%, right? We could figure it out but if you\u2019re not doing that then you\u2019re diluted. Of course that means that any fixed bonds that aren\u2019t generating 10%, they\u2019re long-term diluted.

Do you think that we don\u2019t have a competitive market for everything in this country? It\u2019s obscenely competitive! And so what you\u2019ve got if you look at the NASDAQ is you have like 5 companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft \u2014 those 5. And aren\u2019t they responsible for like 80% of the game? Everybody else is competing and it\u2019s a competitive market! And what does that mean? It means it\u2019s hard to grow 20% a year because whenever you do anything someone else is copying you and they\u2019re pushing on you. So unless you get a dominant digital network with a near-monopoly with these massive, exploding economies of scale on a zero variable cost, low variable cost, it\u2019s very very difficult to perform. And most of the S&P isn\u2019t! To the extent that the S&P isn\u2019t Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, they\u2019re just a bunch of companies competing with each other, so you would think that they would grow at the productivity growth rate of the overall company which is 2\u20133%. If you had hard money \u2014 by the way, coming back to that theory of Bitcoin network value \u2014 Bitcoin network value goes through the roof, skyrockets in the early days when there\u2019s massive adoption and massive technology explosion, but in the later stages of the S-curve when it\u2019s fully diffused and when it\u2019s mature, it just grows with the GDP. It grows with the productivity of the people in the network. If they grow 2% a year, it grows 2% a year! So in a mature equity market you would expect equity indexes, equity prices to grow with the GDP. If they\u2019re growing faster, it\u2019s the monetary expansion, right? Expand the monetary supply 7%, expand the GDP 1%, S&P should go up 8%! It\u2019s gonna be disproportionate. The big tech, the leading-edge, innovative tech, is gonna be double, triple, quadruple that, and then the trailing-edge laggards are gonna be tanking, and then everyone that\u2019s working their asses off as hard as they can is gonna be barely keeping up! Because you have to do 100,000 things right just to stay in business in a real Darwinian capitalist economy. It\u2019s like: Being flat means defeating 99% of the rest of the market \u2014 being flat. To be up, you have to, you know \u2014 Amazon\u2019s up because they beat 15,000 companies! The next two are just slightly okay, and there\u2019s some that are flat, and everybody else is destroyed because of the natural effect there."}

That\u2019s 10 times harder! And the biggest hurdle is: Are you going to be able to commercialize the thing or profit from it? Can you buy something or build something and continuously improve it forever so that you\u2019re competitive and then do it in a manner that is cheaper such that you can charge more for it than it costs you to do that thing. That\u2019s obscenely hard! So typically everybody think that they can acquire something, then when they realize the maintenance requirements they fail, and then very people ever get to the point where they could commercialize something. By the way you can apply it to a boat: Everybody wants to buy a boat, and then they\u2019re like, Oh my God! This is really expensive to maintain a boat and I can\u2019t afford to maintain the boat. But if they buy the boat, they gotta spend 10% a year to maintain it. And then at some point the question is, Can you enjoy the boat? They\u2019re like, Oh! I\u2019m spending all this money on the boat but I never have time to go and use the boat \u2014 this is just crazy! This is weighing around my neck! I gotta get rid of this! It\u2019s an example of being too ambitious in your acquisitiveness, and it illustrates the law of decimation. And the law of decimation is: In the ancient Roman republic if the legion screwed up, they killed 1 out of every 10 men in the legion. Actually the made the 9 kill the 10th in order to remind them that they should stay disciplined."}

They didn\u2019t kill them all because then there would be no legion left! But 1 out of 10 is gonna die if you break ranks and retreat so it was their ultimate punishment, the law of decimation. But you can apply it to anything in life, Robert, but it goes like this: The universe tends towards entropy and disorder. If something will go wrong it does go wrong. That\u2019s Murphy\u2019s law. The law of decimation is: 1/10th of all the moving parts in anything will break in any given year. If you have 10 employees, 1 will quit or become unhappy. If you have 10 moving parts, 1 will break. If you have 10 plans, 1 will blow up in your face. If you have 10 features, 1 of them will stop working. If you have 100? 10 of them will stop working. If you spend $100 Million on something, you have to spend $10 Million to maintain it. You\u2019re gonna have to divert 10% of the cost of anything to maintain something. I talked about, Steel will last forever \u2014 if you maintain it! Most people don\u2019t maintain it! It costs a lot of money to paint a steel ship. Most people, they budget for the acquisition, and then they underestimate the maintenance because they don\u2019t have the humility or the life experience. This is the problem with building Rube Goldberg devices in the crypto network. That\u2019s the problem with all the complexity with Etherium and all the complexity with some of these things: It sounds good on paper, but when you put 187 moving parts into something and when 1 of them breaks and the entire thing crashes and burns and you die, it wasn\u2019t worth it! When you\u2019re young, you overestimate the value of functionality and acquisition, and you underestimate how expensive it\u2019s going to be to maintain things, and then you really underestimate this last issue: Can you enjoy it? This is a basic rule of life: Can I buy the thing? Can I maintain the thing? Can I enjoy the thing? Men are always reaching beyond their fingertips. Sometimes women too. They want too much. They\u2019re empire-builders. This is why Napoleon should not have gone to Moscow. This is why Hitler should have not have gone to Moscow. This is why you don\u2019t fight a war on two fronts. And this is the essence of Stoicism, but Stoicism is really a philosophy that is very consistent with thermodynamics and entropy and complexity theory. And if you\u2019ve ever run anything complicated or built anything complicated or have been responsible for anything complicated, you know stuff breaks!"}

It just pops up over and over again! And my only real explanation is just: friction, randomness, chaos, life, corrosion, weather, termites, bugs, bacteria. The same would be true with your body, right? If you\u2019re talking about maintaining yourself. You\u2019ve got to actually allocate time and energy to maintain yourself and a lot of times people under-invest in their own health. And then when they under-invest in those things they blame it on genetics or they blame it on some unfortunate occurrence. We don\u2019t know why these this happened it\u2019s very unfortunately \u2014 these things just happen sometimes. I\u2019ll end with one thought on Stoicism. And Nicholas Taleb would appreciate this one too. It\u2019s like, The words don\u2019t matter \u2014 the action matters. Okay? Words are just words. And that applies to Stoics: you and me and Marcus Aurelius. I think one of the great paradoxes of history is Marcus Aurelius was the last emperor in the line of the Antonines during the golden age of Rome and there was Trajan, and there was Hadrian, Marcus Antoninus, etc., and for about 100 years that was the Pax Romana, and each of those emperors was elected based on virtue as an adult and he adopted his heir, and they typically adopted a 40-year old emperor who had had a career in the military of virtue and he was tough and responsible and grounded in reality. And if you\u2019re a general in the army campaigning and you get drunk and screw around your soldiers put a knife in you! You\u2019re not gonna make it! In order to keep the respect and stay alive in war-time around a bunch of guys with weapons, you better be a good leader and they better respect you because you\u2019re leading them to their death, if they don\u2019t respect you! So if you actually rose through that meritocracy, maybe you had a chance. So Marcus Aurelius writes the Meditations and it\u2019s the quintessential text on Stoicism. And he says, Just because you can do a thing doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing. He said, Soon you will have forgotten all and all will have forgotten you, and you should know your place in the universe, and you should submit yourself and do the right thing for everyone else, and that\u2019s all good! But at the end of the day, the single most important decision Marcus Aurelius made in his entire career, in his life, was the decision on an heir, and when it came time to make that decision he failed miserably and he appointed his son Commodus to be the emperor. And Commodus was a minor and of weak moral and intellectual constitution and in no way shape or form qualified to be emperor of all the known world. And by so doing that Marcus Aurelius plunged the Roman Empire into chaos and turmoil for hundreds of years, resulting in the deaths of millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of people \u2014 awful! Awful! And there\u2019s your philosopher-king! He\u2019s remembered today as somebody that\u2019s written a good book and had been a great Stoic. But if you look at his actions, the actual action he took was the least Stoic, most foolish, most painful action of any of his forbears and it just makes the blood curdle!"}

It\u2019s just not in the near-term. Yeah, there\u2019s a certain terrifying beauty in nature. There are no ugly animals. You look at a bird that is beautiful. You look at a lion in the wild, it\u2019s beautiful. No one\u2019s got a mangy coat, there\u2019s no unhealthy anything, and that\u2019s our ideal of beauty, right? We think nature is beautiful, all the trees are beautiful, the plants are beautiful, the birds are beautiful, they chirp their beautiful sounds, the flowers are beautiful. What they don\u2019t really think about is what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, because they\u2019ve got this simple zoo backyard view of nature. The truth is, everything\u2019s at its finest when tomorrow is uncertain. When the life of the creature is uncertain. I\u2019ve actually got this beautiful banyan vine trees in the back of my house in Florida. One day on a beautiful sunny day I walked by and I stood and stared at the tree and I saw a bunch of ants running up and down. And when I traced the ants I saw that there were thousands of ants and I saw that there was a centipede. Some kind of millipede about a hundred times bigger than a normal ant. And those ants had decided that they\u2019re going to eat that. They were actually gonna haul that millipede back to their queen as dinner. And they attacked it relentlessly, relentlessly. And I watched hundreds and hundreds and then thousands and then thousands of ants going into this one millipede. And it\u2019s fighting for its life and I swear I watched for 45 minutes like a war non-stop on a beautiful sunny day. If you looked around you would\u2019ve saw grass and blue sky and pretty water and birds chirping, but there was knock-down, drag-out war to devour this millipede and it\u2019s fighting for its life. And I watched it crawl up the tree and the ants dragged it down and it did everything it could and they kept coming and it just had this horrific, terrifying, sad conclusion. It\u2019s gonna die. Unless a massive rainstorm spins up to blow water down and create some disruption it\u2019s got no chance. It\u2019s going to get eaten alive. And it\u2019s horrific and it\u2019s terrifying, and that\u2019s life! That\u2019s nature! And then you start to realize, on all those pretty National Geographic TV shows, you see the lions attack the antelope or the gazelle and they try and this miss like, Well, no dinner for you tonight! No, the antelope trot off happy with their babies and the lions trot off happy with a little smirk. And everybody\u2019s like, That\u2019s about as much nature as they want! Nobody wants any more nature! When you think about it a bit more you realize, Well they\u2019re gonna miss 3\u20134 days, they\u2019re gonna hit 1 of those a week, and the 99% of them are gonna live but 1 of them is gonna die, and over 3 years they\u2019re all gonna die. And over 3 years they were all gonna be eaten by the lions. And that\u2019s nature! Every week that goes by, it\u2019s like they\u2019re clicking on a carousel. And the oldest one is getting slower, and a little bit more tired, and a little bit less flexible, and if they don\u2019t get the old one, they\u2019re gonna get the unlucky one. And that\u2019s why every one of them is beautiful! Because they\u2019re all in the prime of their life! And the same is true with all the predators: they\u2019re all in the prime of their life. When they get a little bit old, a little bit hurt, they get driven out of the tribe or out of the pride and that\u2019s the end of it. So in nature the life expectancy of those wolves or those predators or those lions is 5 years, and in the zoo it\u2019s 15 years. Now if you want to see a fat, mangy, lame one, you\u2019ll find one in the zoo. You won\u2019t find one in the wild. And the same is true with the rest. And when those two herds, when they go at each other like that viciously, they\u2019re both strengthening. You take away the wolves from the deer, the deer overpopulate, they eat all of the trees, the trees all die, the trees die, they destabilize the embankment of the river, the river erodes, the riverbank gets screwed up, all the greenery dies, all the deer are gone, all the wolves are gone. You wanna fix the river? You put the wolves back in. The wolves scare away the deer, the trees grow, the roots stabilize the bank, the river flows, all the wildlife returns. This beautiful thing we call nature is in continual dynamic equilibrium, and everything about it is getting stronger and harder and faster and getting culled all the time. And mother nature is supreme, and men with delusions that they will defeat her are gonna be disappointed, right? I guess the great challenge is this paradox: the paradox is the paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper. We see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards. We can try to shake our fist at mother nature, we can defeat all of those natural forces, and if we try to do that, the energy consumption goes up exponentially. And eventually it goes up to such a level that we deplete ourselves of energy, and we end up like those natives on Easter Island where you chop down every tree to build your monuments to your gods and pretty soon there\u2019s no canoes and pretty soon there\u2019s no fish and pretty soon there\u2019s no food and pretty soon there\u2019s no you! All you\u2019ve got is your monuments to your god and you\u2019re all dead because you depleted the energy in the ecosystem in pursuit of over-engineering your reality."}

So that was Episode 9 of Saylor here at the Saylor Series and wow! What an episode! We started off this series actually with a discussion of Stone Age technologies, which Michael laid out his thesis of how mankind is the dominant animal in the world because we channel energy across time and space more intelligently than any other animal. And he really built the foundation by drilling into our use of fire, one of the primordial energy networks, our use of water as a hydraulic energy network for overcoming gravity, and our use of missiles for actually competing at a distance. And in that lens, if we consider that that is the overarching goal of humanity is to more intelligently or more precisely channel energy across time and space, Bitcoin is an elemental innovation. It\u2019s the only system we\u2019ve ever had throughout history that allows us to channel energy effectively at the speed of light, and store it in a way that is virtually totally loss-minimized. There\u2019s no unexpected inflation for instance, and there\u2019s very minimal transaction fees, just enough to sustain the network. [1:05:06] And you could contrast this with something like gold, which we touched on earlier, that just depreciates at 2% per year at least, or something like fiat currency which tends to depreciate much faster. So it takes a lot maybe to get to here. It\u2019s a whole re-framing of your worldview, but I think Saylor just does an excellent job of that. And I love the example he gave describing immunology \u2014 another one of these elemental innovations \u2014 where we figured out antiseptics, we figured out how to use clean medical instruments and disinfectants and whatnot, and the discovery of penicillin for instance \u2014 all of these things that helped us insulate ourselves from the entropy of microbes to conduct medical and biological experiments and operations with less exposure to the entropy of nature just catapulted our life expectancy! Almost overnight it went from say 50-year average life expectancy to 70 years. So I wonder \u2014 and I love the way he described it as, Doing business, we\u2019re conducting economics thus far in history with dirty money, with contaminated money. And you could analogize this to doing surgery with contaminated medical instruments! If you don\u2019t decontaminate your medical instruments and you try to perform surgery on someone, you\u2019re going to cause an infection and you\u2019re going to cause death. And this was actually a major cause of death throughout most of history. So through a similar lens, if we\u2019re trying to build socioeconomic systems using a money that\u2019s contaminated with the uncertainty of inflation or confiscation or de-authorization, it tends to make me believe that the system that we would build would be more vulnerable to death as well! And I think that a quick study of history will show you that typically the debasement of money tends to presage the collapse of the civilization. So when the money becomes extra contaminated, this tends to be a specter or a harbinger of its ultimate demise. So I love this analogy! And it really gets into the entropy aspect again. We just consider that entropy is uncertainty. [1:07:35] We want medical instruments that are free from the uncertainty of microbial infection. We want economic instruments that are free from the uncertainty of inflation and de-authorization and confiscation. Like, it just makes sense. The more certainty we can add to our tool set whether in the medical or the economic domain, the more longevity we can give the organism or the organization, right? It just makes sense. And as Saylor said earlier, Monetary energy being the highest form of energy that humans can channel, and channeling energy across space and time being the highest aim of man, that effectively monetary energy is life energy! It gives us a claim on all other forms of energy. So we can think of encryption actually \u2014 I think Saylor Tweeted this at some point \u2014 that the destiny of all money is to be encrypted. We can think of encryption itself as a sterilization function or process for money. We\u2019ve actually disinfected the money by encrypting its rules and its supply. That hearkens back to consumer packaged goods, when we\u2019re able to vacuum seal foods and store food energy in a stable fashion at room temperature \u2014 that was a game changer! All of a sudden we had this abundance of economic surplus in food energy that we could distribute around the world, and this led to a surge in population growth. So all these analogies pointing back to this breakthrough that is Bitcoin that again we\u2019ve been building on in earlier episodes I just found to be super-exciting! And then in that lens, Saylor also talked about the story of his mother being diabetic. And the connection I made there was that she was essentially following a governmental food advisory, just eating the typical food pyramid that governments \u2014 at least the US government \u2014 used to advise, which had carbs as the staple, the big thing at the bottom: bread, pasta, etc., and worked its way up. Whereas in fact, anyone that studied ketogenics and the paleodiets and whatnot, it tends to actually be the opposite: you want low-carb, high-fat or high protein diets. And it\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s not one size fits all, but a lot of diseases we suffer from today like diabetes is from excessive carb consumption. So the connection I made there was that this government food pyramid scheme or mistake \u2014 whatever you want to call it, whether the intention was good or bad \u2014 it\u2019s actually rooted in the government fiat currency pyramid scheme, where we have contaminated the money. So we\u2019ve contaminated even the ideologies we put out in terms of nutrition, and it just has these cascading effects. Inflation is not just contaminating our economic efforts, but it actually bleeds over into the biological domain. So as Saylor said, Fiat currency is toxic money. It\u2019s just not sound. It is not entropy-free. It\u2019s infected with entropy, and this has all these second-order effects with everything that it touches. [1:11:10] And the main problem is this misunderstanding about inflation. We have this whole economic sphere today focused on CPI as inflation. But it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. There\u2019s deeper reasons why if you read a book like Human Action by Mises that you can can never have an index for inflation, because, sort of like value itself or beauty, it\u2019s subjective, right? It\u2019s based on the things that you individually desire, based on the course of your own goal-directed action, so there\u2019s not a universal index that can fit everyone. Your own inflation number is a basket of these goods that you\u2019re seeking. And the government metric is just taking what they assume to be things that are desirable, but exclude assets. So it\u2019s like they\u2019re excluding the fact that anyone wants to get wealthy, which is absurd. Also excluding food and energy and other volatile assets. Volatile meaning they changed in price! We\u2019re talking about a metric that is intended to reflect price changes excluding things that changed in price. It is a non-starter, it\u2019s absolutely crazy! And this is still the benchmark number that so many people are focused on and it\u2019s just amazing to me that it still goes on. And the discussion flowed into understanding inflation, which for me I think this makes more sense which is: If you think about it in rate of change terms, as in how many Dollars are being produced? The growth in Dollar production relative to the growth in good or service production. If you pace a fiat currency production that\u2019s outpacing the productivity gains or the output on a particular good or service, it\u2019s going to inflate in price because you\u2019re going to have more dollars chasing the same or only slightly growing goods or services. So another way to say that is: How energy-intensive is the good? The example that I like to think about is ribeye steak. We\u2019re not gonna invent a technological breakthrough that makes cows grow faster. It still requires the same amount of sunlight and energy and time and processing to deliver a ribeye steak, and it turns out historically that actually the purchasing power of gold maps pretty nicely to ribeye steak, or cows more generally. [1:13:48] So in that way inflation is not a single universal phenomenon that we can peg to one index number. It\u2019s occurring differently for every asset and every person in every place at every time. It\u2019s just this undulating sphere of changing economic values. You can\u2019t possibly just put a number to it and say that is inflation. Another way to say that is it\u2019s just uneven across space and time. So you\u2019re dumping new money supply into the system, that money itself is distributed unevenly, and then the aims of economic actors are shifting unevenly as well, supply and demand. So it\u2019s just hubris to think that we could peg it all to one index number! To that point, Saylor makes a more sound argument that a more appropriate measure of inflation \u2014 knowing that we can\u2019t peg it to a number \u2014 but what we can do is say, What are things that people generally desire, and how much are their prices changing year over year? He gave the example earlier of retirement, premier real estate, things like this \u2014 things that people actually want in life! You don\u2019t go to work to think, I just want to put food on the table for the rest of my life. At some point you\u2019d like to work towards an aim or a goal whether that\u2019s a nice home, living in a nice neighborhood, possibly I love the example of early retirement where you can just buy a government bond that pays you a \u201crisk-free\u201d rate for the next 30 years, and looking at the price of government bonds and how much that\u2019s jumped based on monetary policy. So I thought that was just a great example. It\u2019s interesting because when you really get to first principles on it, fiat currency inflation as we define it is just an arbitrary increase in the money supply that adds no economic value to an economy whatsoever. It\u2019s very important to understand that by \u201cprinting money\u201d, you\u2019re not infusing an economy with any new factors of production, whether this is human time, ingenuity, tools to put in factories, there\u2019s nothing being added to the economy. You\u2019ve just reshuffled the paper claims on those productive factors. You\u2019ve taken away from those relying on fiat currency or the Dollar as a store of value. You\u2019ve reallocated those claims to whoever can get their hands on the new printed money first and spend it first. So it is a mechanism for theft. I don\u2019t know what else to call it, frankly. It only has one purpose. You can argue about the intentionality \u2014 whatever. I\u2019m not going to debate that. I can just tell you that the tool, fiat currency \u2014 the inflation of fiat currency \u2014 has only one purpose: To reallocate wealth from some and allocate to others against their will. So I don\u2019t know what else you could call it really besides theft. And it seems to me like this Keynesian ideology feels like a coverup! I don\u2019t if they just believe what they\u2019re saying about inflation. Saylor was arguing that they bled George Washington to death and they thought that was the best course of action \u2014 maybe that is the case! Maybe Keynesian economics are so deeply steeped in this ideology that they just can\u2019t see their own hand in front of their face so to speak. Or perhaps it\u2019s something more nefarious, more of a propaganda stick thing. But regardless, I love the point that \u2014 he tied this into an old German propaganda machine. He said: The studies show them that they can\u2019t tell people what to think, but they can tell people what to think about. And it is amazing to me how many sophisticated investors I\u2019ve talked to about Bitcoin and macroeconomics over the years, and people are just anchored to CPI as inflation. It\u2019s as if this wool has just been pulled over their eyes, that they are satisfied with the answer presented to them versus thinking more deeply about it. And I can\u2019t help think it\u2019s related to this, right? It\u2019s pushed as the representation of inflation and people just accept it at face value, which is just a really bad deal all the way around. [1:18:37] So we got into a bit of discussion about interest rates, and his analogy of actually suppressing interest rates is freezing out market participants or sucking the air out of the room. If you consider that the interest rate is the price of money, money is this tool for trading time and energy, we could consider that the interest rate is the price of time or energy, effectively. And when you try and suppress it, you\u2019re fighting against the natural flow of time, if you will. It\u2019s this misguided attempt to try and mute entropy that causes \u2014 Taleb would call this an iatrogenic effect. So it\u2019s harm caused by the healer. When someone overmedicates \u2014 again back to George Washington \u2014 they thought they were helping George Washington by bleeding him, but they were actually hurting him. They actually killed him by doing that. You know, many doctors today will prescribe you a pill for your cholesterol or your anxiety or whatever it may be. Whereas in fact the right treatment of the core problem \u2014 not just a drug to cover up the symptoms \u2014 could be something more like removal. Elimination of certain foods from your diet or fasting or whatever it may be. And this to me, it points towards what central banks ostensibly at least have been trying to do, is that their explicit aim is price stability and low unemployment. So price stability, you\u2019re saying that you want supply and demand worldwide to be like consistently close enough to keep prices stable. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense. You\u2019re arguing against the entropy of nature again. And when you try and artificially inflate the money supply to create this veneer of stability, you\u2019re actually just delaying \u2014 first of all you\u2019re manipulating market prices \u2014 supply and demand, buyers and sellers, are having trouble getting matched up correctly, which is what the market does because of this distortion in the marketplace. But you\u2019re also delaying and exacerbating the ultimate correction, because you can\u2019t fool economic reality. In that way I see \u2014 the vision I have in mind \u2014 is central banking is kind of like an air conditioner. An air conditioner is a heat pump, so it\u2019s pulling entropy out of the room. It\u2019s not actually putting cold air into the room, it\u2019s pulling hot air out of the room, or heat energy out of the room. And if you\u2019ve ever stood behind an air conditioner, you\u2019ll feel it! You\u2019ll feel the heat coming off of it that it\u2019s pumping out of that room that it\u2019s air conditioning. And it seems like a central bank is trying to accomplish that in a way, it\u2019s trying to paper over the entropy, the natural entropy of price stability and unemployment. But in doing so it\u2019s pumping out \u2014 it\u2019s creating certainty for its shareholders, let\u2019s say , so it\u2019s decreasing entropy for its shareholders\u2014but it\u2019s pumping out entropy onto broader society in the form of price distortions, an exacerbated boom and bust business cycle, and you could even throw warfare in there! Central banks were originally set up to fund warfare, to give governments a virtual limitless mechanism for funding the war. Where instead of just needing to rely on their own savings they could just print money and siphon savings off the entire productive economy. So that\u2019s my central banking air conditioning analogy, that it\u2019s trying to cool the room for its shareholders but it\u2019s pumping heat onto broader society and it\u2019s just disastrous. [1:22:52] So we got into the relationship between inflation rates and the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate would be yield on government bonds. So in finance we say that \u2014 and this is a \u201crisk-free\u201d rate \u2014 that the US government for instance cannot default on its debt because it can always just print more money to pay its principle. What that actually means is that it can never default on its debt because it can externalize the cost of that debt onto society via inflation. So that\u2019s your risk-free rate, whatever the US 10 or 30-year treasury is yielding. And then there\u2019s the inflation rate \u2014 again not CPI \u2014 our proxy is how quickly is the US M2 increasing on a percentage basis. And the delta between these two is a negative real yield! If I can only get 2% on US treasuries \u2014 it\u2019s lower than that today \u2014 but US M2 is growing at 15% year over year, it\u2019s expected to do that over the next few years, then I\u2019ve got a negative real yield of of -13%! So unless I\u2019m growing my business or my own personal cash flows by more than 13% year over year, then I\u2019m being diluted! I\u2019m losing money! So this is the hurdle rate, basically, to use another investment term. You need to at least exceed the delta between inflation and the risk-free rate to even be accretive to your business or your household, whatever it may be. So the only way to do this is you need to buy an equity \u2014 and a lot of people are doing this \u2014 they\u2019re buying equities as a store of value that is expected to appreciate faster than that negative real yield. A lot of this is in tech because tech has just a ton of productivity gains associated with it, and it had a great decade so there start to be market actor expectations built into the price, where if you look at the P/E ratio of something like Zoom or even Tesla or Facebook, they\u2019re astronomically high relative to historic averages! Another way to think about that is: There\u2019s nowhere to store your value that\u2019s safe except these equities that are expected to grow and outpace the hurdle rate and remain relatively scarce. So that leaves with these bonds that are yielding less than the inflation rate, they\u2019re long-term dilutive, and then those negative real yields, that\u2019s driving and incentivizing people to buy scarce assets. Again: equities, real estate, gold, and then this is also the bucket you put Bitcoin\u2019s value prop in, is that it\u2019s the scarcest liquid asset in human history, so of course it\u2019s gonna benefit from this centrally planned market manipulation in both the bond and the fiat currency markets. And we talked a bit about this, just one way to strip out central banking market manipulation and get an honest assessment of what\u2019s going on, is to just price the index in gold or Bitcoin \u2014 again Bitcoin\u2019s a bit more noisy because it\u2019s emergent \u2014 gold has a much longer history. Or to Saylor\u2019s point you could also price it in the change in money supply. And this will strip out a lot of the manipulation. So if you look at the past decade in the S&P, it\u2019s been one long bull market \u2014 you price that same chart in gold, it\u2019s flat. There hasn\u2019t been a lot. So that\u2019s I think really important as far as changing your economic frame of reference, which is what\u2019s so tricky about talking about these things, about like What is Money? [1:26:51] Because it\u2019s an a priori perception. An a priori means \u201cno priors.\u201d You\u2019re looking at what is looking, so to speak. And people just \u2014 the a priori economic way in which we\u2019re in today is Dollars for most people: this is what they think in, that\u2019s what they trade in and negotiate in. But you have to look at the dilution occurring in that frame of reference, which is the Dollar. So it\u2019s a bit of a meta-thinking, but it\u2019s really important for coming to sound economic conclusions and calculations. Then we got into the competition and the law of decimation. Saylor made the point that, Even if you\u2019re smarter than 99% \u2014 say you are one of the top 0.1% most intelligent people in the world, you were smarter than 99.99% of humanity, there are still on this planet 750,000 people smarter than you! That was just crazy to me to think of it that way. And in the digital age, I think what we\u2019re entering into is this Age of Excellency almost where because the bounds of location have been lifted through digital tools and technologies, it\u2019s no longer good enough to just be the best local guy at whatever it is \u2014 singing, for instance. Maybe you\u2019re a Billy Joel impersonator or something. It\u2019s no longer a good career strategy to just be the best Billy Joel impersonator in your neighborhood. Because people have YouTube now! They can go and look at the best Billy Joel impersonator of all time, or maybe even Billy Joel himself, and they can seek their entertainment there. So you start competing for audience with the best of the best in any domain that can be conducted remotely, which increasingly is every domain. So this means that excellency is gonna have more of a tendency to rise to the surface, and that markets more typically are gonna converge on winner-take-all dynamics. It changes things a lot! This non-locality or not being bound by geography really changes the game a lot in a lot of ways. So Saylor\u2019s point was: You\u2019ve got to focus your energies to compete well on your speciality \u2014 whatever that is, whatever skillset or unique ability you have, whatever gift you might have \u2014 and you\u2019ve got to stay humble, and you really have to focus on that, developing it to the best of your ability, but also maintain the humility I think necessary to succeed and learn and grow. [1:29:44] Any time \u2014 as he was describing his experiences at Microstrategy, it\u2019s ferociously competitive! \u2014 any time you become arrogant or comfortable or resting on your laurels, 1 of those 750,000 are just gonna eat you up! They could go out, raise a bunch of money, they want what you have by definition if you\u2019re successful. If anything, digital tech has made the world more fiercely competitive, which I thought was really interesting. As far as the law of decimation, we brought up the point that in Ancient Rome, the law of decimation was: Any time the soldiers broke ranks or retreated, 10% of them would randomly be put to death, and they would make the other 9 put the 10th to death. And what this was was a massive disincentive to malperformance. Everyone had a big incentive to hold the line so to speak, and to act in a concerted effort, because if they didn\u2019t, if they got fearful or started operating in their own individual best interest in a battle, when you need the collective effort of the battalion to win, then they\u2019re engaging in this lottery where either they\u2019re gonna be put to death or at least 1 in 10 of their friends is gonna be put to death. A really good system for inducing skin in the game. And it turns out that this is\u2014again getting back to the natural law \u2014 it\u2019s sort of a reflection of what we observe in nature, in that 1 in 10 of any system with 10 moving parts, 1 is gonna break down over a year, roughly. A 10% breakdown in parts or features per year! I observe that as just being \u2014again we\u2019re creating these systems that are intended to confront the entropy of nature and deal with it in certain ways \u2014 well that has a cost, right? And every year, by some universal magic that number tends to be about 10%. And this pointed back to steel: as Saylor referred to, Steel will last forever if you maintain it! So you need to expend the 10% per year painting it to maintain it. Maybe this is also related to the religious tithing which we see as a 10% contribution annually to the institution \u2014 and that\u2019s across a number of religions. And I think this too points to a strength of Bitcoin, is that it actually has minimized moving parts. And it\u2019s open source so anything that does break down, there\u2019s as many eyes on it as possible to repair it. But it minimizes its \u2014 say in comparison to Ethereum that just has countless moving parts \u2014 it\u2019s gonna suffer more from this law of decimation over time than something like Bitcoin will, which optimizes for survivability. Finally we got into the philosophy of Stoicism. And this is a philosophy which ties back into everything that we\u2019ve been talking about: It\u2019s consistent with thermodynamics. So again if we\u2019re just saying it in a purely physics sense, Truth is an accurate portrayal of reality. We know that everything in the universe is energy. So therefore conservation of energy \u2014 which is the first law of thermodynamics \u2014 that is truthfulness! So the systems, the strategies, the techniques, the businesses, the individuals that optimize for energy conservation \u2014 this doesn\u2019t just mean defending all of the energy you have, you can actually increase energy efficiency through innovation. So being exploratory, figuring out a new way of doing things can actually add to your energy efficiency as well. So there\u2019s this ratcheting effect between defending what you\u2019ve gained and gaining new innovation. So Stoicism is this thermodynamic philosophy if you will, which I think is so cool, that it\u2019s a way that many of the ancients accorded their behavior, and it directly maps onto innovation and general biological success. So the Stoic \u2014 again we had this law of decimation, we had these systems encountering the chaos of nature, there\u2019s a little bit of breakdown over time \u2014 the Stoic embraces that! The Stoic knows and willingly embraces death, the potential death of your child, the potential loss of your business or your fortune. There are all these practices when you get into Stoicism like negative visualization, where you may imagine for instance the next time you hug your mother, you just imagine that that may be the last time that you ever hug her. And through that mental practice you\u2019re actually training yourself to be more grateful for something in the moment, and you\u2019re preparing yourself for the inevitable loss that will come, right? Your mother will be gone one day. So Stoicism is a deep rabbit hole in an unto itself. And I\u2019ll just leave it at one example. I just thought it was really cool that Stoics embrace entropy and choose to accept it and strive on valiantly nonetheless. And I think that\u2019s the only proper approach to life if you\u2019re gonna be successful. Saylor went into a paradox of Marcus Aurelius which I had ever heard before \u2014 I\u2019m a big fan of Marcus. Marcus was this great philosopher king, great writer, but in the end, sort of blew it on one decision. And Saylor\u2019s point here was, Words don\u2019t matter, actions do, ultimately. And even one action can undo a lifetime of good action. This reminded me of Taleb\u2019s, Don\u2019t tell me what you think, just show me what\u2019s in your portfolio. It\u2019s more about what actions you take with skin in the game versus your cognitive beliefs. And for me personally I tied this back to religion actually is that, people always want to argue, Do you believe in God? Do you not believe in God? I love Jordan Peterson\u2019s answer to this: I act as if God exists! God doesn\u2019t care about my cognitive beliefs, it\u2019s more about my embodied action and my moral behavior that really matters in the world. So it\u2019s a bit of an Occam\u2019s Razor thing there. But anyways, the story of Marcus is, he had the keys to the kingdom. One of the most successful emperors of all time, he was the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king, and on his final decision essentially as emperor of Rome, decided to break duty, break with tradition, break with the Stoic protocol if you will of appointing the most competent man for the job for succession, and instead appointed Commodus, which was his son. And there\u2019s something really deep here. There\u2019s this age-old struggle between duty and love. I don\u2019t know\u2014this one left me thinking! So I\u2019d be excited to hear some of your guys\u2019 feedback on this. But it\u2019s really fascinating to me that we had this guy we\u2019d held in such high regard and then at the last yard-line so to speak he just fumbled the ball! But I don\u2019t know if this was based on love for his son or something else, but it\u2019d be really interesting, right? If he made this decision out of love so to speak, yet it still proved to be wrong decision for civilization. Just a mind-bending thing, but I thought it was super interesting. And the warning there is: You can live a good life, you can be a good leader, a good writer, whatever, but you have to always remain humble and never become arrogant no matter how much success you\u2019ve had because there\u2019s always that opportunity to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as Saylor put it, which I thought was brilliant. Then finally we completed the episode with a discussion of antifragility and vitality. And I love this point that animals in the wild are all beautiful because they\u2019re constantly being conditioned against the chaos of nature! Once they went past the tipping point of misfitness they\u2019re no longer serving their highest and best function in the world, something else eats them. They\u2019re gone. So it\u2019s nature rolling forward and becoming better through this process, this dynamic equilibrium between predator and prey, and it\u2019s this Darwinian natural selection that\u2019s constantly promulgating excellence and beauty in the world. And it\u2019s great to behold! If you\u2019ve ever watched a nature documentary it\u2019s one of the most awe-inspiring things I think that we can watch! So another way to think about this is just nature constantly sharpening her own strategies against herself. So the strategies of animals \u2014 the survival strategies \u2014 are constantly being tested against the environment. And those that succeed roll forward and those that do not are weeded out and so you\u2019re left with by definition the most fit creature for its environment. When we try and disturb that dynamic equilibrium we\u2019re just exacerbating that correction. Instead of having these little corrections along the way, we\u2019re giving time for the strategy and the environment to diverge significantly to where an ultimate cataclysmic return is necessary. That\u2019s what nature does! It always selects and it always restores balance. So all of that tying back into \u2014 again when I think that central banking is just a failure of an institution because it\u2019s tried to over-engineer this dynamic equilibrium of nature where we have price instability and unemployment as a natural product of the business cycle, it\u2019s trying to paper over that, it\u2019s trying to eliminate this dynamic equilibrium and create something that\u2019s predictable. It\u2019s trying to subdue the entropy of nature if you will, which could be a good intention but clearly has a poor result, which leads to suppressed interest rates which is like trying to reverse the flow of time. So it\u2019s all of this effort going countervailing to nature that always fails! That\u2019s the core point here. It turns nature into a zoo! Right? We said that every animal is beautiful, but if you really want to see some not-beautiful animals you can actually go to a zoo. They\u2019re sad, they\u2019re in a cage, they\u2019re not fulfilling the function for which they were evolved, and I think central banking sort of turns society into a zoo. It softens us \u2014 in this process of trying to \u201cprotect us\u201d from price instability and unemployment, it\u2019s actually reducing our skin in the game, softening us, externalizing entropy onto society. So yeah! Just another awesome episode. Hope you guys enjoyed this. Saylor and I are gonna do at least 1 more episode, maybe more after that, we\u2019re gonna see how it goes. But I hope you enjoyed this one as much as I did, and I\u2019ll see you here again soon! Thanks!"}

Welcome back to Episode 8 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! Today we\u2019re gonna talk about a number of interesting concepts getting even deeper into Bitcoin theory and how it has effects on the future of humanity. So if you haven\u2019t seen Episodes 1\u20137, I highly recommend you check those out. A lot of the material we built upon there, it\u2019s compounding as we get deeper into Bitcoin theory. So today we\u2019re gonna talk about a number of things. Firstly is the divinity of engineering, actually, and how this creative impulse is sort of what defines Man and fulfills Man. We\u2019re also gonna look at Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and talk about why Saylor thinks it\u2019s actually a low frequency medium of exchange and a high frequency store of value. We\u2019ll also learn why it\u2019s a pretty bad idea to compensate people with Bitcoin. It turns out the tax codes are pretty hostile to that at the current time. We\u2019ll also look at another monetary function of Bitcoin, and that\u2019s as a unit of account. We\u2019re gonna look at Bitcoin too in a macro context: How it sits as an asset class adjacent to other asset classes. We\u2019re also gonna do a deep dive into crypto versus digital networks. This is a delineation that Saylor makes to distinguish decentralized crypto networks versus centralized digital networks. And we\u2019ll talk about the trade-offs between the two. Then we\u2019re gonna get into the really interesting topic of immortal sovereignty, which is something that crypto networks enable and actually allow us to project our preferences beyond our own life. I think that\u2019s a really interesting part of the conversation. We\u2019re gonna revisit money as power, we\u2019re gonna talk about advanced technology as magic, and we\u2019re gonna see what the two of those look like when they come together. And then finally we\u2019ll discuss Bitcoin as a pure and principled ideology, which is something somewhat unique in the modern age. So this is another big episode! I hope you guys have seen 1\u20137. If not, again, go check those out now. And with that, let\u2019s jump in!"}

My religious tradition too was Southern Baptist \u2014 I was raised Southern Baptist \u2014 so I have Judeo-Christian underpinning in my thought. But the ancient idea in Genesis was that God was the force that confronts chaos with courage, truth, love, and converts that chaos into good, inhabitable order. So when we look at that through a thermodynamic lens, we know that the whole universe is everywhere and always trending towards increasing chaos and entropy, and that the only thing that works against that thermodynamic arrow of time is life, actually! Life converts entropy into order. So in a way we could say that life or even the God-aspect of life is the anti-entropic principle that propagates through all of life. And I can\u2019t help but relate that and see Bitcoin in that lens, too, where we do have this system that\u2019s actually reaching deeper into chaos than anything else. The SHA-256 mining algorithm is quite literally finding a single atom in an entire universe \u2014 that is the mining race, if you will, is identifying the single atom in the universe \u2014 and with that reach into chaos it is forging the most profound order we\u2019ve ever had! You can\u2019t argue with the Bitcoin blockchain. Whoever has those UTXOs has them! So it seems to me like there is a profound connection between truth and this principle of converting chaos into order, and the quote that took that home for me with G. K. Chesterton was, A dead thing can go with the stream, only a living thing can swim against it. So Bitcoin in that sense is quite literally alive!"}

The beaver is engineering the stream to create a dam, human beings are engineering systems. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary energy system. It\u2019s the first well-engineered monetary system that we\u2019ve built. Human beings through their intellect channel that energy, and within the [Bitcoin] system we extract order and we have a very efficient structure, and the price we pay is some disorder outside of our system. Some energy dissipation. But I\u2019m not terribly concerned with that. The universe has got more energy than it needs and we\u2019re just dipping our fingers into 0.000 \u2014 with a million kazillion 0\u2019s after it \u2014 0001%, right? So it can spare a little bit of energy! And when we create something beautiful \u2014 be it a railroad or Bitcoin network or social network or the like \u2014 we find a way to do something millions of times faster, smarter, stronger than before, and that drives forward the human race. So this is not the only great achievement of the human race, it just happens to be the most interesting achievement of the human race!"}

The human that constructs the city. The human that creates the machine. And that\u2019s been going on for human history! That\u2019s the most honorable and admirable thing that human beings can do.

And it\u2019s important that, in that regard, you be able to exchange assets. It\u2019s, in my opinion, utterly unimportant that you be able to engage in high frequency small transactions on the Bitcoin network. And I think that it\u2019s dysfunctional to pursue that vision. I think that Roger Ver is just wrong! I mean it was a nice idea. Roger Ver thinks the magic in Bitcoin is to be able to pay for coffee with your phone. And it\u2019s a tragic error of insight \u2014 that was not the magic of Bitcoin then and it isn\u2019t now! The magic of Bitcoin is being able to catapult energy 100 years into the future and not lose the energy. And then the other magics are the magics that come from wrapping the Bitcoin with software to make it smarter, faster, and the stronger \u2014 that\u2019s the magic! The ability to do a minor transaction, it\u2019s trivially inconsequential. Number one, only 1\u20132% of your wealth needs to be in these high frequency transactions. So a logical thing for anybody is just to keep 1, 2, 3% of their wealth in fiat. And then operate it on the Paypal network or the Visa network or the Apple Pay network or some centralized network. I think Saifedean\u2019s already made the point: A proof of work network is a billion times or a trillion times less efficient than the centralized version. So you\u2019re gonna get a billion times more speed and a billion times more economy by running the 1% of your life on a centralized network. And if you didn\u2019t need to move it to off-chain \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a crypto, I just think off-chain\u2019s just a centralized network! You might as well just put it on Square or Apple, because nobody cares whether they go out of business in a year, 2 years or 5 years. And if you\u2019re in a country, the fact that those transactions are being monitored just means that, well, 1% of the value of your transactions are being monitored! If you want to do something illicit, you would do it 0.01% of the time on the Bitcoin network! So the one time in your life when you need to flee Iraq or Syria as a refugee, and that\u2019s when you need to do your on-chain transaction, well then you use Bitcoin and you can wait 30 minutes \u2014 you\u2019ll probably be okay. By definition: If you move $1 Billion once, it\u2019s a billion times more valuable than moving $1 once. And so the use case of moving $1 Billion back and forth is valuable, and you can pay high transaction fees. And the use case of moving $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, or $50 or $100 is not valuable, because it falls exponentially or at least linearly with the amount of money being moved. Now there\u2019s some other reasons why Bitcoin doesn\u2019t make sense as a medium of exchange right now. And maybe never! I tend to think never. I think what\u2019s gonna happen is \u2014 well we can debate semantics about what medium of exchange means \u2014 but I think Bitcoin is a high frequency store of value, low frequency settlement network. Or low frequency medium of exchange. Once a month is more than enough! Once a year? Maybe enough! Once in a lifetime? Might be enough! If the rest of the ecosystem develops, there will be a point at which there\u2019s a crypto bank and Robert Breedlove has 200 Bitcoin in the account and he points the bank toward the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin\u2019s worth $1 Million a Bitcoin and the bank will forward you fiat on credit at good rates to do whatever you want your entire life \u2014 the Bitcoin will never move. And the bank will do whatever, and if the bank fails, what do you care? The bank failed, not you. It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ve got 1%, you\u2019ve got nothing at risk, they actually took all the risk! So you don\u2019t need to do things with a high frequency to create value other than protect the money. Now there are some accounting and systems and tax reasons why it doesn\u2019t make sense as a medium of exchange. The obvious thing is: Every time you actually take revenue in Bitcoin, it would be a taxable event. You would mark the Bitcoin. So if you paid me in Bitcoin while Bitcoin is trading at $10,500, I have to mark it. You pay me $27 in Bitcoin, I have a ledger entry: $27 of Bitcoin with $10,400 basis. If your friend bought another $32 book, I have another ledger entry! If I sold a million things in Bitcoin, I\u2019d have a million ledger entries with a million different basis prices. And then if I paid you a salary in Bitcoin, I would then have to figure out capital gain on it, and then I\u2019d have to pay the tax. So if I have $100 Million in Bitcoin and then next year I pay $100 Million in expenses in Bitcoin and Bitcoin went up by a factor of 2, I would actually generate $100 Million in capital gains and I would owe $20-$30 Million to the federal government within 12 months for the privilege of running Bitcoin, which runs a billion times slower than Apple Pay! So how many ways is this awful? Well first of all, it takes a decade to get your accounting systems to work. It\u2019s worthwhile to note: How does a global multinational work? I have 27 subsidiaries in 27 countries. I do business in about 10\u201315 different currencies: US, Euro, Yuan, Yen, Pesos, Real, Mexican Peso, Argentine Peso \u2014 you name it! We\u2019ve got lots of currencies! By law we do that. By law we pay all the medical bills in those currencies, all the insurance, all the vendor relationships \u2014 took 10 years. It takes 10 years to set up a global multinational from start to finish! [18:17] It probably takes 5 years to get all your accounting systems to work right, $20, $30, $40 Million to get it all working right. If I buy $500 Million in Bitcoin, I put it in the treasury, I stare at it, I never do another transaction hopefully for the next decade. Until we\u2019re in an insolvency event, we\u2019re not moving it, right? Why would we? The truth is, we want to put it in the vault and throw away the key! Like, I would say to anybody, I don\u2019t want to be able to move it! I just want it to sit there! I\u2019m gonna wait for it to appreciate. Then we sell stuff in Yuan and Yen and Euro and Dollar, and we put that into our accounts. We sweep all the fiat into maybe one currency, into one thing: Dollar. We balance, and if we need to shuffle some stuff around in working capital accounts we put it back. If we don\u2019t need it for working capital we sweep it into the treasury. If it\u2019s in the treasury, we convert it to the treasury reserve asset \u2014 Bitcoin! It goes in, never comes out! You know, a vendor wants \u2014 they send me a bill, I pay them in a local currency. No vendor\u2019s gonna bill me in Bitcoin. People say \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this \u2014 Well, don\u2019t your employees want to get paid in Bitcoin? Well the answer is, No, they don\u2019t! But let\u2019s say the answer was, Yes. Let\u2019s say all of them were Bitcoin maximalists. Exactly how much Bitcoin do they want to get paid in? They have mortgages. They have bills. So the answer is, We pay them in the local currency, and if they want to buy Bitcoin, or if they want Bitcoin, they buy it! Why would it be an awful mistake to pay them in Bitcoin? Because we would accelerate the tax bill by 100 years. And as Bitcoin is volatile, we will generate all sorts of tax obligations. The second thing is, we would increase our accounting complexity by an order of magnitude. And the third is, our employees will then have to sell the Bitcoin and generate their own taxable accounting complexity in order to get cash to pay their mortgage and pay for their kids\u2019 school or whatever they\u2019re doing, right? So you\u2019re creating lots of complexity here. If I\u2019ve got 2,000 employees and 200 of \u2018em want to own Bitcoin then I pay all 2,000 in Euros and Dollars and Pesos and Yen and Yuan and they go on their local exchange and they buy the Bitcoin and they HODL it! Because like, Do I want to HODL it? So the point is, when you\u2019re running a company with Bitcoin as an operating system, the logical thing to do is you just sweep your fiat into your treasury, convert your treasury into Bitcoin, let it sit there, and then let every \u2014 if a vendor wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! If an employee wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! The whole ethos of Bitcoin is: Take responsibility for yourself! Don\u2019t treat adults like children. So it\u2019s patronizing in a way for me to say, Well Robert you work for me, but I\u2019m gonna help you by paying you in Bitcoin! It\u2019s like, You\u2019re a smart enough person \u2014 if you want to buy Bitcoin with it, here\u2019s the money. Buy Bitcoin with it \u2014 have at it! It\u2019s what you do. The money has a constant value at the time I\u2019ve transferred it from me to you, and the thing that really cripples a cryptocurrency and a thing like Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the tax treatment that the local regulatory domain makes. At the point that the United States IRS decided that this was going to be taxed as a capital gain on the moment of sale, it was utterly impossible for it to be a currency. It\u2019s just that simple. It\u2019s done. For anybody to even maintain it \u2014 the only way you could think that you could use it as currency is if you\u2019re gonna run a black market, grey market operation with no accounting, no accountants, no lawyers on staff. And it\u2019s like, Good luck with that! I mean, how many discos and bars got shut down for sales tax or income tax evasion, right? What was it, like \u2014 most of them! Small businesses, they\u2019re eventually going to all run afoul of the regulators and get shut down. So it\u2019s just not practical from a systems point of view. It would take me a decade to rewire the systems. It\u2019s not practical from a complexity point of view. You\u2019ve just made your accounting a hundred times as complex. And it\u2019s not practical from a tax point of view. [23:38] You\u2019ve just tripled the tax rate. And it\u2019s not practical from a whatever employee point of view because it\u2019s making everybody else\u2019s life more complicated too. So that\u2019s why I think that Bitcoin really isn\u2019t a medium of exchange as much as it is just a low frequency settlement network. I\u2019ll make one more point, this is back to via negativa: The fact that you could settle peer-to-peer means that you might not have to for 100 years! The fact that I say to you, Robert you do as I say, or else! \u2014 if you have the ability to leave the country and depart with all of your wealth and I know you have the ability \u2014 right? Robert Heinlein has a phrase, An armed society is a polite society. I live in Miami Beach. Sometimes I run around, and people have guns in Miami. You can carry concealed carry permit, right? A young debutante that looks harmless could be walking around with a gun in her purse, and you think twice when it\u2019s 2 in the morning and you\u2019re in a bar and everybody\u2019s drunk, before you\u2019re pushy or rude. And then you think, Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be in a bar at 2 in the morning when people are drunk! And then you think, Maybe I shouldn\u2019t mouth off to someone that just cut me off on the highway. Somebody pulls over and they shoot you dead! And you think, I just oughta be very polite to everybody walking down the street, because every single person could have a gun concealed on their person. And maybe I\u2019ll be nice to people today! It\u2019s a deterrent, right? So the ability to cash settle, or the ability to settle and exchange, that\u2019s the deterrent. Because the fact that I know you could means that I\u2019m gonna treat you with respect! If I knew you couldn\u2019t, if I thought that you were trapped \u2014 if you were stuck in my monopoly and I had total power over you\u2014then I start to take you for granted. And then I start to abuse that power. Because as Lord Acton said, Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So the power to do a thing is more important than the doing of the thing. And that\u2019s what the Bitcoin Cash guys, they miss. They miss the fact that: If I can move all the money when I need to, then I won\u2019t need to! And so yeah I need to be able to move it so it will hold $100 Trillion in value, but no I don\u2019t need to move it now! And maybe I don\u2019t need to move it more than once, ever, just to make an example. It\u2019s like nuclear deterrence. I use it once, maybe I used it twice \u2014 I haven\u2019t used it since. But do you think that doesn\u2019t \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not effective? You think it doesn\u2019t matter to have it?"}

And this gets back to the difference between a free market and a monopoly. In a free market, you know that your customers have options. They can go to other providers, they could settle elsewhere, they could move their capital out. And because they have that optionality, you as the producer or provider are accountable to their preferences. You have to listen to the customer. You have to listen to their wishes and desires and make sure you\u2019re satisfying their wants. Whereas on the other end of that spectrum is the monopolist that, to your point, he just doesn\u2019t care about the preferences of his customer because his customers have no choice! They\u2019re stuck in his little fiefdom. I mean it\u2019s the difference between an economic democracy and an economic dictatorship. So the fact that Bitcoin is just totally movable anywhere, anytime and you can\u2019t put the gate around it and monopolize it is what makes it such a game-changer!"}

They\u2019re not gonna let you invent something that allows you to evade taxes, and so: Why try so hard? It\u2019s just not worth the trouble! I\u2019m reminded of the stories of Pablo Escobar, and he made the billions of dollars selling all the drugs and cocaine and they said at the end of his life he\u2019s sitting on the run and they\u2019re burning $100 bills in order to stay warm!

It\u2019s an example of just trying too hard\u2014not worth the trouble! So let\u2019s talk about unit of measure. Bitcoin as a unit of measure: I think Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. It makes sense in that way. Before Bitcoin, if you go back 50 years, people talked about ounces of gold. So I think a Bitcoin will be like an ounce of gold \u2014 an immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy \u2014 it makes sense to think of it like that! On the other hand, it will generally always be converted into local fiat in the political domicile in question for buying and selling things. And that\u2019s okay. There will be countries that allow stronger, better currencies. There will be countries that\u2019ll have weaker currencies and they\u2019ll crash their currencies and they\u2019ll replace their currencies. And as long as you HODL Bitcoin in your account you\u2019ll be able to go into a new country. You know, I\u2019ve been to a country after they crashed their currency. We\u2019ve all been to Germany, they crashed their currency, we bought the new currency. Then they got rid of the Mark and it was the Euro, we bought the Euro! So the right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy and not overthink it, anything more than that. It can be interesting to say divide stock price by gold ounces \u2014 you can divide the cost of living by ounces of gold or by Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s interesting! It\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll give you a pretty good read on inflation. If 1 Bitcoin buys you a car in the US but 1 Bitcoin buys you a skyscraper somewhere else then you\u2019ll have relative cost of living. People did that with the Dollar, right? They used to say you could live in Mexico on the beach for $187 a month and live like a king. There are relative strengths. I think Bitcoin will be like that! But I don\u2019t think we need to stretch it any further than that. I think that\u2019s enough! I think ultimately, people focus too hard on medium of exchange, unit of measure, and they underestimate the value of Bitcoin as a store of value and as an asset. I think they undersell it and they don\u2019t do it justice! Because it\u2019s so much better than every other asset! And then I think the entire community of crypto, it\u2019s too much engaged in debates between the various crypto networks, with each other. Because I\u2019ll post something \u2014 Bitcoin is a great way to transmit energy into the future \u2014 and then the Ripple people will start fighting, and the Bitcoin Cash people, someone gets triggered and takes offense. The way I see it is: Crypto is a $300 Billion pond sitting on the beach next to a $300 Trillion ocean of capital, of energy. That\u2019s 99.9% of all energy of humanity, is sitting in alt-assets, not altcoins! Not cryptocurrency! So I see all the crypto enthusiasts working on all the altcoins and they\u2019re just trying to drag down Bitcoin. It reminds me of a bunch of crabs in a bucket and the bucket\u2019s kind of hot or overheating and the one crab wants to crawl out and the other crabs just want to drag it back in instead of crawling on its back and getting out! It\u2019s like, all the crabs just keep pulling each other back into the bucket. It\u2019s totally self-sabotaging and it doesn\u2019t matter, because what they ought to be thinking is, How do we get $30 Trillion of the $300 Trillion to flow into our pond? In fact, they ought to be thinking, We want to go from $300 Billion to $3 Trillion, and from $3 Trillion to $30 Trillion, and from $30 Trillion to $300 Trillion. And the way you\u2019re gonna get there is not by attacking each other. The way you\u2019re gonna get there is by dividing the market and focusing! So if you want to be a cryptocurrency, well currency means you have to have a stable asset value because the IRS is gonna tax you to death if it changes. So Tether can be a currency, and it cannot change! Do we need one? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a centralized stablecoin, and maybe we need a decentralized stablecoin. The market will decide that. But that\u2019s a thing in its own. And if you want to build a crypto application, there are applications of things that people might want that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t do like: total privacy, or maybe you want to issue title or provenance, or maybe you want to do a decentralized exchange or wrap something or implement insurance or lending. That\u2019s fine \u2014 DeFi. There are applications \u2014 have at it! You\u2019d be better off to, say, Ethereum is 60% of the application market, Tether is 52% of the currency market \u2014 cryptocurrency and crypto app \u2014 and then Bitcoin is 95% of the crypto asset market. And if you believe in another type of asset, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s impossible to ever come up with one, I just think that right now the only clearly successful crypto asset is Bitcoin."}

So it\u2019s almost like you just have to accept that. And then I describe the rest of the crypto-asset universe as liquid venture capital subjected to little, if any, due diligence! Some of them may succeed meaningful in markets orthogonal to money, but it\u2019s very high risk. And the fact that anyone can spin up one of these assets in 15 minutes on the Ethereum blockchain, there\u2019s a very low barrier to entry, very low diligence, so invest accordingly! I\u2019d suggest no one \u2014 if you\u2019re gonna have a crypto-asset portion of your portfolio, I think the highest risk position you could ever be in is 80:20 Bitcoin to everything else.

I think we see it the same way. And I guess it\u2019s a good segue just to general crypto theory: the emergence of magic in cyberspace. What\u2019s a crypto network, what\u2019s a digital network? How do I view it? And you tell me if I\u2019m right or wrong. I\u2019m a newcomer \u2014 you\u2019ve been around for a while. My view of crypto network is: A crypto network is a software application running on a decentralized network with a consensus mechanism, ideally proof of work, arguably maybe proof of stake or some other consensus mechanism that theorists would agree promotes decentralization and antifragility. And a digital network is a centralized network. It\u2019s a Facebook or Twitter or Google or Apple or whatever\u2014a more conventional client-server network. So as we look in the future of cyberspace we\u2019re gonna see crypto networks and digital networks. Why would you want a crypto network? You want a crypto network for immortal sovereignty and antifragility. We know Bitcoin is doing that right now. If you want to convey humanity across time and space \u2014 especially across time \u2014 maybe across time and domain, domain might be even better than space. You know, crypto networks aren\u2019t necessarily faster than digital networks for moving shit through space, but they\u2019re better at moving it across domains, and the reason for that is that sometimes you have lowest common denominator regulatory or compliance constraints that cripple the innovation in a digital network. Apple Computer will never do certain things because they\u2019re subject to the US law, even though they could do them in 98 countries! And so a crypto network may in fact develop faster across regulatory domains if digital networks are crippled. There\u2019s obviously trade-offs between digital and crypto, and I think about it as like: Trust, Security, and Duration are attributes of crypto. Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance are attributes of digital. If I want to do it cheap, it\u2019s a billion times cheaper on a digital network. [42:37] If I want performance, it\u2019s a million times faster on a digital network. If I want functionality, it\u2019s likely much more functional. There\u2019s nobody that would dispute that Apple Pay or Apple or Google, they\u2019re beautiful, functional products. Apple or Google Maps. Trying to do Google Maps on a decentralized crypto network would probably be a disaster! And then compliance \u2014 digital networks are better at compliance. Sometimes we regret their compliance. They shut down stuff and they censor things. But they\u2019re better at compliance. So the very things that make crypto attractive \u2014 Trust, Security, Duration \u2014 are purchased at the price of giving up Economy, Performance, Functionality and Compliance. The conclusion is: Some stuff makes better sense to be doing digitally, and other stuff maybe with crypto. It\u2019s early days, and the only obvious conclusion we both agree on is Bitcoin is a successful crypto network as a store of value. We know that. Everything else is an experiment and when it hits $100 Billion it\u2019s not an experiment anymore. And we can debate whether it\u2019s an experiment at $50 Billion, but I would say at $100 Billion it\u2019s a thing, and it\u2019s pretty clear. And it might be a thing we all know and recognize below that, but you\u2019d need a lot more education to determine that."}

And this reminds me of an old quote, If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. So the centralized solution is kind of like going alone, because it\u2019s just according to one single plan, it can innovate very quickly and move in a certain direction very quickly. Decision-making is concentrated. Whereas the decentralized solution has more of a dynamic equilibrium that lets it persist further across time. So the centralized solution is going to be really compliant, really fast, really innovative, but the decentralized solution is really only useful when you need censorship resistance. You need to know that it will persist across the maximum duration of time, and that no individual group or individual for that matter can shut it down or manipulate it. So Bitcoin is at the extreme end of that decentralized end of the spectrum, whereas something like Apple would be at the other end."}

A vertebrate versus invertebrates. Different life \u2014 plants versus animals. They\u2019re different creatures. And they have different life spans! You want to live for 2,000 years? Or do you want to live for 80 years? One of them moves faster than the other, but one of them is more vulnerable than the other. I think from a human point of view, the real question for humans is: Do you want to put your trust in Man, trust in the organization, trust in a company, trust in a government? And/or: Do you want to put your trust in a crypto network? And we\u2019re gonna solve our problems with a segmentation, mixture of these trusts. We\u2019re probably not gonna put the functionality into Bitcoin\u2014in a total decentralized proof of work network \u2014 that will do what Amazon does or Uber does or Pandora or YouTube does. Probably not! But do we really need to? We probably don\u2019t need to. So when we think about the crypto industry segmentation, I think you really want to divide and conquer. A crypto network is a life form. And I think that\u2019s different. I mean there\u2019s a genetic encoding in a crypto network, and it\u2019s very different than solving the problem with a human being or solving the problem even with a digital network. When you design the protocol, Bitcoin, and you let it go, it becomes a life form and it multiplies and all these nodes spread and all these miners spread. And you can\u2019t easily pull the genie back in the bottle and re-engineer the genetics of it when you\u2019ve released it into the wild. In fact, you would almost say that once plankton is spread out to dominate all the ecosystem \u2014 if God had a better idea \u2014 he created that and made those minnows! Or he created bacteria \u2014 he created a new species. You have a better idea? Create something different, and if that something different is in the same energy ecosystem as the plankton it\u2019s not gonna make it! [48:01] If you take a bird, the bird can coexist with a deer, but it\u2019s hard to create two apex predator birds and put them in the same space at the same time\u2014one of them eats the other one! One apex predator creature. And that\u2019s the same thing with crypto, I think. You gotta think of it as an evolution of a new life force in cyberspace, and the genetic code is of paramount importance! So if you really hope to be successful \u2014 and this is my opinion \u2014 when you release the privacy coin, you need to say, This is for this thing, and this is what it is, and we\u2019re going to get it just right and we\u2019re gonna let it breathe and let it live and we\u2019re not gonna mess with it or monkey with it. And we\u2019re not gonna decide that we wanted the monkey to have wings and also have gills and swim. And if I\u2019m watching TV and I see these cool antler things and I want to put the antlers on it! You can\u2019t be a technology-tinkering enthusiast with a crypto. You have to have more of the mindset of, It\u2019s the crazy guy in the lab coat in the laboratory creating a new kind of life, virus, creature. It\u2019s like you get one shot, and it\u2019s at a lab \u2014 and you\u2019re done! You can\u2019t get it back! And so you should be aware of just how important it is. It\u2019s a protocol. Life is a strand of DNA and that DNA is going to go and it\u2019s going to do whatever it\u2019s going to do. You\u2019re creating life. And so how devastating is it for God to say, I created human beings. I made a mistake. I\u2019m gonna recall them and then tinker and then do a human being 2.0. It\u2019s a problem, right? [50:04] In the Bible, the biblical analogy is the flood where everybody just gets killed. Or some crazy stuff in the Garden of Eden. But with things like Ethereum, right? You\u2019ve got Ethereum 1.0 and now you try to do Ethereum 2.0 \u2014 you\u2019d almost be better off just to do something different as opposed to like retrofit something, because it\u2019s going back and trying to force-fit the DNA. You could do it with a digital network. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re running on a single server and you can throw a switch and everybody switches with it. But the whole point of a decentralized life form is that they\u2019re all different and they all get to make their own decisions! And if you can order them to do something, it doesn\u2019t feel that decentralized anymore, does it?"}

It is the purpose of the crypto network to be an asset, and Bitcoin clearly is. And then Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision and the rest are trying to be. It seems pretty clear that Bitcoin is 93\u201394% of all the assets and the other ones are probably going to zero! And the only way you don\u2019t go to zero is: You have to be differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates you. It\u2019s a species, right? I can\u2019t be almost like a bunny rabbit, I need to be a wolf! I need to be different than a bunny rabbit! And it\u2019s an important caveat: Differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates. In other words: Differentiated in a way such that Nature gives you an advantage in natural selection. So taking Bitcoin, forking it, and making it do transactions 10 times faster isn\u2019t good enough because you\u2019re a million times slower than the other way to do transactions. So that\u2019s just not a genetic mutation that works. It\u2019s an example of a faulty genetic mutation that kills the carrier \u2014 it\u2019s an extinction-level mutation. Genetic mutations happen all the time in Nature. Most of them are mistakes. But some of them might work! If I can stand up on two feet and if my eyes start to work 10 times better than your eyes and I can fashion missiles then maybe that\u2019s gonna work for me. And maybe I will procreate. So it\u2019s not impossible to have a genetic mutation on Bitcoin that would be naturally advantageous. It\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s just, the ones you look at right now, like, what do you have? I mean, transaction speed? That\u2019s really no good. Privacy? It\u2019s a regulatory threat and so therefore it\u2019s probably a nice thing but it\u2019s a bullseye in its forehead which means that when the regulators go to shut down crypto exchanges the first thing they\u2019ll do is pass a law against that, right? And so, give me an example of a mutation on Bitcoin that would make it a distinct asset as a store of value that would deserve to have its own life?"}

It\u2019s not impossible to conceptualize that maybe there would be one, but right now it looks like Bitcoin is 94% of the crypto-asset market. You can\u2019t include Ethereum because although it\u2019s proof of work now it\u2019s going to proof of stake, and they don\u2019t even have an intellectual commitment to be proof of [work 55:04]. And proof of stake is\u2014it\u2019s not clear to me that proof of stake is intellectually defensible over the long term. It\u2019s not proven. It seems like it may be defective as an idea, right? It\u2019s like an example \u2014 we\u2019re back to this issue: It\u2019s like I want to hobble the antelopes. It\u2019s like somebody complained we\u2019re using too much energy! It\u2019s almost like the environmentalists took over and they\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re just mad that someone\u2019s using too much energy so they want to pass a law to stop it. But it\u2019s a law against Mother Nature, and it\u2019s [brooding 55:44] to hobble the antelope. So the 4\u20135% of crypto-assets that are left \u2014 the Satoshi\u2019s Vision, Bitcoin Cash \u2014 none of them are differentiated enough that they would seem to have any future in a Darwinian world that I can see. So they\u2019re destined to [hugely 56:04] to go to zero. So then we go to cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a simple one \u2014 stablecoins. People go ballistic if you say they\u2019re cryptocurrencies because everybody wants Bitcoin to be a cryptocurrency! But if the definition of currency is money that you can legally spend in a country without incurring taxes, Bitcoin is not a currency, but Tether is! Because\u2014it\u2019s kind of simple \u2014 read the IRS tax code. You\u2019ll find, most places on Earth, they\u2019re gonna tax it as an asset. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! In fact, that\u2019s better. It\u2019s actually a mistake: Why would you want to create a short-term currency that\u2019s a billion times more expensive to implement computationally than the other way? It\u2019s like, the only reason you\u2019d want to do something a billion times more expensive is for immortality \u2014 immortal sovereignty! That\u2019s a good reason. But you\u2019ve got that. If you had that on 99% of your assets 99.9% of the time, then you\u2019re good. Then you could afford to have a little bit of risk in order to have a billion times faster performance on a digital network. So that\u2019s currencies. The only reason for a cryptocurrency is for regulatory arbitrage or maybe innovation due to decentralization. If you can make the argument that we\u2019re gonna innovate faster because we\u2019re governed by the laws of Singapore and people in Malta can use a Singaporean cryptocurrency and it\u2019s not technically illegal, it\u2019s just a hundred times better because we\u2019re able to tap into that regulatory arbitrage opportunity, you could call it a [free? 57:55] market, then I think, Okay! Fine! Then I think there\u2019s a place for a cryptocurrency."}

And so you could almost argue that if Tether is the king of stablecoins, it\u2019s running on a digital network, not a crypto network. Like, DAI \u2014 the irony is that DAI is a truly decentralized one \u2014 but people don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s inefficient and it doesn\u2019t quite peg the value. But you could create a cryptocurrency as a stablecoin using an oracle, using some information feed, and using Bitcoin as the underlying collateral and create a synthetic Dollar and a synthetic Euro! You could! And will we need it? It depends. I mean that takes us to crypto applications and digital applications. I mean Binance and Coinbase and Huobi and the like, they\u2019re digital exchanges. They\u2019re digital networks for exchange. And then you\u2019ve got the decentralized exchanges, right? Uniswap, SushiSwap. There\u2019s a very romantic notion, like, Decentralized exchanges will beat digital exchanges. I\u2019m not so sure! We\u2019ll see! The point that I made in one of my Tweets is: So I buy $400 Million worth of Bitcoin. I do it in 7 days. For 7 days, I have some exposure on a digital exchange. I move it to cold storage for the next 10 years or 20 years. So for the next 7,500 days it\u2019s off the digital exchange. So 99.9% or more of the time I\u2019m not exposed to the risk of a digital exchange, and so everyone that days, Well digital exchanges are risky. Well it\u2019s risky in the same way that walking across the street is risky, Robert. But you do it! In theory when you cross the crosswalk, if the red light failed, couldn\u2019t you get slammed into with a truck and killed? Okay, so are you gonna take the position that we\u2019re gonna have to build flyovers on every crosswalk in the world? Eh, pretty expensive! You know? So what will happen there? I don\u2019t know, but it seems to me that Binance is doing just fine as a centralized exchange. And it seems that Square works fine as a digital client application. And if Apple Computer announced that you could send Bitcoin or cash via Apple Pay or iMessage tomorrow, I think a lot of people would be pretty happy to do that! No one would be complaining about it! And it really comes down to this issue of: Economy \u2014 it\u2019s a million times cheaper, Performance \u2014 it\u2019s a million times faster, Functionality \u2014 it\u2019s a million times more functional, and Compliance \u2014 they\u2019re probably more compliant in the country you\u2019re in! So if you can do it on a digital network, you probably will! When you think about crypto, you really have to ask this question: What is so important that I want immortal sovereignty? What is so important? And certainly my life force. If you said to me, Michael, I\u2019m gonna take all of your energy and I\u2019m going to protect it and I\u2019m going to fulfill your wishes from now to 1,000 years from now \u2014 I think that\u2019s worth it! That\u2019s a religion! That\u2019s a crypto! You know, I have a park. I\u2019d like for the park to be trimmed and the trees to be kept nice and I\u2019d like for the park to be beautiful for the next 1,000 years and it\u2019ll cost $1 Million a year. And so if I put $50 Million into endowment and it generates 2% yield, then I could reasonably say to Robert, Robert, why don\u2019t you take my $50 Million endowment and put it into Bitcoin. And then it becomes the question of: How am I gonna see my wishes through for 1,000 years? Well the current way you would do it is you would create an institution like the Rockefeller Institution or the Hughes Institute. [1:04:08] And you trust human beings. What we\u2019re really talking about is: We\u2019re talking about the crypto-asset network of Bitcoin taking the base layer and holding all the monetary energy for 1,000 years. Or 100 years, if you think 1,000 years is crazy \u2014 we\u2019ll go 100 years. And then we\u2019re talking about a digital network. Maybe it\u2019s gardners.com or Amazon will probably do it because they\u2019ll probably do everything by the time we get through the decade. There will be nothing that they\u2019re not doing! Let me make it easier: Let\u2019s just say I want to send flowers to everyone in my family on their birthday for the next 100 years with a little note from me telling them how much I love them \u2014 that\u2019s a simpler thing. I endow an account with Bitcoin, I create an Amazon account, I wire it up with flowers, I create some kind of mechanism so that when children are born they get added to the family unit, and the thing drips out a little bit of monetary energy in Bitcoin, converts to fiat, buys the flowers for $187,000 a dozen roses in the year 2047, and it ships them for the person, and I die happy, and for the next 100 or 1,000 years, flowers get delivered to people in the Saylor family line because that was my last will and testament! And how would I do it if I was John D. Rockefeller 100 years ago? I would have a crapload of assets, probably a lot of gold and stock \u2014 and he owned every oil company and they\u2019re still around \u2014 and then you would put some of that into a foundation. A non-profit foundation, because you need tax-free, tax-advantaged. That\u2019s why you need to go non-profit. By the way, all of your capital gains become tax free, tax-advantaged, and all your income becomes tax-advantaged, right? So that\u2019s a good idea. And then you have a board of governance and you have 5 advisors and they appoint a money manager and they appoint a business manager and when one of them retires they have a selection committee process that puts someone else. We\u2019re probably on the 7th generation of advisors to the Rockefeller Institute. By the way, John D. Rockefeller created the University of Chicago. It\u2019s still running. Rockefeller created a lot of stuff that\u2019s still running! Rockefeller University. So I can do it the old-fashioned way, but to do it well you\u2019re probably talking about $100 Million of assets and a $5 Million a year operating budget. You get down to $1\u20132 Million it\u2019s not really \u2014 $5 Million a year is the minimum. Your best bet is you have to become a university, a religion, a church, or a non-profit, a Hughes Institute. So that\u2019s the way that you get immortal sovereignty, or like some long-range sovereignty. Another standard way people do it is like, Rockefeller bought up all the land on the Hudson River and he gives it to the state of New York, turn it into a state park or national park like Grand Teton National Park, and you get the federal government, the state government to agree to fund it in perpetuity per the Smithsonian Institution. The problem with all those things is that sometimes you just can\u2019t even trust the governments, right? But your best bet is you lay it off on a state or a federal government, and that\u2019s okay until the government fails or it reneges on something or other. The bottom line is that it\u2019s not really within the grasp of a small or mid-size business or the individual. What is YouTube? YouTube allows you to become your own TV station! So what are we talking about here? The clich\u00e9, Be your own bank, if we look at it a different way it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a normal person, I endow my own monetary energy into Bitcoin, I plug it into to some digital network, I give the keys to someone I trust \u2014 family member, heir \u2014 maybe I do multisig, right? Instead of having 5 people on a board \u2014 if you have 5 people on a board of an endowment with $100 Million or $1 Billion in the endowment, they\u2019re kept honest by filing annual tax forms with the IRS. And in theory they could be personally liable if they defraud the foundation or abuse their fiduciary trust. But you know it\u2019s kind of like a 20th Century idea! A better idea would be: I put the money into Bitcoin and I have 3 or 5 digital keys. And it takes 3 out of the 5 to vote on anything. And every 3 months they have to register that they\u2019re online and of healthy mind and spirit, and if someone stops registering then that remaining 4 automatically appoint a 5th, and whenever anybody retires they automatically transfer their key, and then what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve dematerialized an endowment, board of directors, corporation, institution. And it\u2019s just become maybe a simple application in cyberspace plugged into a base layer of monetary energy. And it\u2019s doing something! Whatever the something is. And so that\u2019s a combination of (1) people and (2) digital networks and (3) crypto networks in order to allow people to achieve their hopes and desires over long periods of time."}

Okay so you appoint 3 trustees of the Breedlove Institute, you endow it with some amount of Bitcoin. You live a fine life, you depart, and their rules are: Every 10 years they have to find someone to replace them. You put your own term limits in there! By the way, you could put all sorts of rules in. You could say that everyone that actually reads my stuff and passes the test can vote on who the 5 trustees are gonna be. Or, you can\u2019t even be a trustee unless you\u2019ve watched and read everything and understood everything and passed my quiz that I left for you. What if Ludwig von Mises left all of his stuff in cyberspace and we\u2019d need to read all his stuff and pass it and pass an oral exam by him in order to become a fellow. And if we become a fellow we\u2019re invited into the academy of Austrian Economists, and that goes on to all eternity. And then the academy adds to the body of knowledge and they can upgrade the protocols and they can upgrade the tests and they can pass the flame down from generation to generation and the entire thing becomes antifragile and it\u2019s the religion of Austrian Economics! I\u2019m thinking the guild system. If you want something to be an immortal sovereign crypto network, then you think like the guilds. It\u2019s gotta be something that people are so passionate about they\u2019ll pass it down from parent to child, father to son, mother to daughter, master to student. There are things like that: schools of martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, religions, etc. And the medieval guilds were like that! Maybe there would be a \u2014 for example, I like environmental causes. What if I had a park and I said, Well people have to go in and they have to work in the park and support the park, but the park is this private/public entity where you can be a member and you get to use it but only if you can contribute to it and protect it. And then I endow it and it becomes a self-sovereign entity for 1,000 years. It\u2019s like a park-owner\u2019s association, right?"}

Or, I want to endow a professorship of Austrian Economics \u2014 but then someone takes over the university and so they divert the money to buy a new hot dog truck. So\u2014I\u2019m dead \u2014 how do I make sure that someone doesn\u2019t, that they really fulfill my last dying wish? How do I make sure? Well I can do it if I have a Rockefeller Institute and they hold the purse strings and they dole it out annually and then they watch. But then I have to actually have a bunch of people that I trust that 100 years from now will remember what my wishes were! And maybe nobody cares about that. It\u2019s a challenge for people. I went to Naples this year. And if you go to Naples, you go into the port, you have all these superyachts in the port, and very very wealthy people on the superyachts. But if you walk out of the port there\u2019s puddles on the floor and there\u2019s this park in the middle of Naples right next to the port and it runs about 10 blocks. And 50 years ago it was beautiful and the jewel of Naples and it was like Central Park and everyone could come there and enjoy the day. Now if you walk through it, all the buildings are spray-painted, they\u2019re all closed, there\u2019s pooling stinking water, no grass grows, it\u2019s just mud. It looks like something 40 years after the apocalypse! It\u2019s in the middle of like the third largest city in Italy. There\u2019s money everywhere, and yet somehow neither the municipal government nor the state nor the federal government of Italy, nor any wealthy person, can manage to come up with $100,000 Euros a year to water the grass and mow the lawn. In the middle of a city of a million people \u2014 the public jewel the city, the single most important piece of real estate in the entire city\u2014is suffering from a tragedy of the commons. Now I ask myself: If I was that wealthy person and I wanted to bring that park to life, if you wanted to do it top-notch you need $1 Million Euros a year. You want to do spectacular? $10 Million Euros a year. If you want to just mow the lawn and water it and keep it from being a stinking, mud-infesting war zone? $100,000 Euros a year. How do I actually endow that park without having the money hijacked by whoever hijacked the money? Because obviously none of the economic energy is making it to that park in the middle of Naples. It might be a more worthy cause just giving a third of my money to the government as tax on my death, or two-thirds when I die for them to \u2014 whatever they\u2019re doing, like, What could you say about a civilization that can\u2019t keep its central park in its most important city in the province from being a stinking, post-apocalyptic zone?"}

So people have wishes. They have a hard time realizing their wishes. There\u2019s a lot of ways to do it, and the theoretical magic way to do it is: I create a program on a crypto network in cyberspace, it runs on a blockchain network \u2014 nobody can stop it, ever, it\u2019s unstoppable code \u2014 it\u2019s literally a magic spell! A less intense way is: I power it with crypto network and I use a combination of people and digital networks to do it. I think ultimately people can achieve what they want in a variety of ways. If I want to be fed, I can feed myself by hunting a deer, hunting some chickens, growing some corn \u2014 these are all different ways to achieve what you want. The real key is: I need to have mastered the technology of hunting, cultivating animals, wildlife, and farming. And if I have all three of those technologies on my fingertips that I can mix and match, then I can actually do something interesting. I think that\u2019s the potential here. We talked about: Money is power. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So if you apply advanced technology to money, then you can give someone magic power. The source of magic power is providing an instruction into the digital and crypto network space and powering it with crypto network space such that you cast a spell in the future, or cast a curse into the future when you\u2019re long gone. That\u2019s real magic, right? Like, casting a curse 30 years after I die \u2014 that\u2019s impressive magic! Less interesting but more practical is: I just want to cast a spell while I\u2019m alive. And the magic spell I would cast, were I a magician, is I would go to that park in Naples and I\u2019d wave my hand and it would become a beautiful paradise with gorgeous trees and nice grass and water flowing and cleanliness and safety and free ice cream cones for the kids and flowers and happy music and concerts on the green. And it would be like that forever, because that\u2019s my magic! By the way, in fantasy, the great magicians, the demi-gods, the powerful wizards, they have magic power \u2014 they can do that! And the more powerful they are, the longer the spell lasts. So if I have $1 Million, I can do it for a year. If I have $100 Million, I can do it forever. If I have $1 Billion, I can allocate 10% of my power to do it there forever. Magic power, right? Money is power. You got enough money, you can snap your fingers, materialize a jet, it\u2019ll fly you to Tokyo on 10 hours notice. It\u2019ll cost you about $250,000, if that\u2019s how you want to expend your energy. If you don\u2019t have enough energy it doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t have $250,000 \u2014 right? The other part in those magic stories is the mere mortal that wants that same trip, their life force is sucked out of them and they\u2019re aged 82 years and they die! If I take a middle-class person making $72,000 a year and they need to fly from New York to Tokyo for $250,000, that\u2019s all the savings they\u2019re ever gonna have! I just sucked their life force out of them to cast that spell. And so how much power do you have? And how much magic can you bring to bear? Look, John D. Rockefeller had magic. He just did it the old fashioned way. And his son did, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. They went to all the beautiful places on the Earth, they bought them all up, and then they ended up turning them into national parks. The US Virgin Islands is a Rockefeller Park. St. John, they bought. Acadia, they bought a lot of Mount Desert Island, made it a national park. Grand Tetons, they bought all that land, made it a national park. Most of the land up and down the Hudson River \u2014 between they and J.P. Morgan \u2014 they bought it and made it a state park. They were casting spells."}

The senator from Rhode Island. So I think that in a nutshell is my views on crypto. I think ultimately we\u2019re moving into an exciting world where people are gonna be able to achieve great things with a variety of digital networks and crypto networks. What we can see right now for sure is: There is at least one successful crypto network \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 there are many successful dominant digital networks \u2014 YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc., plenty of them \u2014and the future is gonna be defined by these networks, and you just gotta decide what\u2019s the best tool for the problem? You can solve problems with people. I can pick up the phone, I can call you and I can say, Robert, buy me $100 Million worth of Bitcoin! And I solve the problem with a person. Or I can solve the problem with a digital network. I can go online on Binance and I can start like typing and trading, and I can buy $100 Million worth of Bitcoin. Or I could solve the problem with Uniswap \u2014 with a decentralized total crypto network. What will happen? The market will determine\u2014what we know is that over time, what was done by people will start to be done with digital networks, and what was done by digital networks may in fact float into crypto networks to the extent that sovereign immortality is worth the trouble. And if you\u2019re gonna make a crypto network \u2014 if they\u2019re just doing it for regulatory arbitrage it\u2019s probably got a 10-year life span and it\u2019s shaky \u2014 because who\u2019s gonna lay down in front of a tank for something like the difference between Binance and Uniswap? Would you sacrifice your life to try to trade on Uniswap instead of Binance? Because I wouldn\u2019t! Let me tell you what they\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for: They\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for Freedom, for their Religious Values, for the Future of their Family, for the Future of their Ideology. If they have a passionate belief, they will lay down in front of a tank in order to defend it. The principles of Science and Justice and Humanity and Truth. Not everybody! But you don\u2019t need everybody! You need the keepers of the flame. You need the maximalists. The 1% who are willing to fight and die for the principles. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We didn\u2019t come up with it here today in this call. It was a basic truth that founded a lot of things including the United States of America. And if you go back to the Roman Republic, there were a lot of Romans when the Roman Republic was healthy, and they were willing to fight and die for Roman principles. To a certain extent, a lot of good Romans assassinated Julius Caesar because they thought they were fighting for Roman principles. And a lot of wars were fought over it. So if you really want a crypto to be successful over 100 years, the technology is only a part of it, right? It\u2019s the ideology paired with the technology. And you\u2019re gonna have to have an ideology that is so pure and so straightforward that people will fight to the death to defend the ideology. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m probably not gonna sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts! It\u2019s not that important! On the other hand, if you tell me that we\u2019re about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages, then I think I\u2019ll fight for it. That\u2019s worth fighting for."}

That was Episode 8, and man! Just another big, deep dive into Bitcoin and its implications! Globally, really. So we started the episode out talking about how divinity of engineering. As Saylor mentioned, the beaver \u2014 which is the mascot for MIT \u2014 the reason the beaver is the mascot of this engineering-focused school, MIT, is because the beaver is really special! He actually goes into nature and harvests materials and re-sculpts the flow of rivers, frankly, by damming it and using his wits and ability to build a habitable structure for himself and his family when he goes to reproduce. So the beaver ends up being this symbol for this divine quality \u2014 that really life has \u2014 which is engineering. This divine quality of engineering has found its highest expression in Man. At least as far as we know, we are the animal most capable of harnessing this quality that the ancients would call the Logos, which is the ability to confront the chaos of nature, dissect it with the categorical capabilities of our mind and our words, communicate about its properties and qualities to learn about nature, and basically convert this unexplored territory into explored territory, and convert chaos into good and habitable order. And this is a really deep and ancient idea, but it\u2019s something fundamental to life and to humans. And civilization itself we can think of as just a bubble of this habitable order amid the unlivable entropy of the universe. And you can see this even in like the Southeast United States, there were areas in say Mississippi that were just not habitable whatsoever prior to the invention of the air conditioner! So that\u2019s maybe one extreme example but there were literally places \u2014 geographic locations on Earth \u2014 that we simply could not live until we became sufficiently advanced technologically. And Saylor has a great quote on this. He says, \u201cHumans are divine when they engineer a better habitat for themselves and those they love through their intellect.\u201d So again this to me points back to work, which Bitcoin\u2014as we\u2019ve discussed \u2014 it\u2019s money rooted in proof of work as gold was. Work itself is a noble pursuit, right? It is the means by which we convert chaos into good and useful order, and I would argue that it elevates our timelessness. It\u2019s actually allowing us to accomplish greater results with less efforts in terms of making productivity gains. It\u2019s also lowering our time preference, making us more long-term oriented. And in this process we develop more morality, more selflessness even, and we also develop greater survivability as a species. So when the entropy of nature inevitably creeps in, we have the ability to respond to it. If there\u2019s a natural disaster or something out of sort, we can harness resources from other pockets of civilization and channel them into the affected areas such that they can recuperate. So I thought that was just a really interesting topic, and it points towards the instrumentality of Bitcoin in helping us better focus on this divine quality. Bitcoin really is money purpose-built for entrepreneurial experimentation which involves engineering and problem-solving. Whereas you could look at something like fiat currency: much more based on bureaucratic theft. We\u2019re talking about individuals and organizations that add no value to the productive economy and just siphon value off of those that do [out in 1:35:30] the world and engineer. So in that sense, by re-enabling and re-energizing work itself, we could view Bitcoin as a form of divine money, in a way. And then we got into Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. And in 2017 during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, there was a bit of a delusion in related to this word \u201ccash\u201d in the whitepaper where Satoshi called Bitcoin originally peer-to-peer cash. And the thought was \u2014 at least by the Roger Vers of the world who represented Bitcoin Cash\u2014that Bitcoin needed to be used in day-to-day transactions. What this is ignorant of actually is the original meaning of the word cash, which comes from the French word caisse, which meant money box. And this was used as a term in the 19th Century to indicate final settlement. So it was a bearer-asset money. Physical gold, physical silver was said to be cash. And only in the modern age have we sort of repurposed this word to mean the government debt certificates that we trade with today and call money. And knowing what a genius Satoshi was, I am confident he was clear on this meaning of cash, and did not mean Bitcoin needed to be used as a day-to-day medium of exchange to proliferate. And by the way, even if he did, it doesn\u2019t matter, because the market selects the purpose and utility of a tool. So Bitcoin is being selected \u2014 has been selected \u2014 by the market as a store of value. And that\u2019s the direction we think it\u2019ll keep going. So the magic of Bitcoin if you will \u2014 as we\u2019ve discussed in earlier episodes \u2014 is this ability to transfer monetary energy in a loss-minimized way. So you can send energy across time and space with minimal loss, essentially. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important, not the ability or speed or low transaction fee to move it at a high frequency \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. So to Saylor\u2019s point on that, the Bitcoin network is optimized for suviveability \u2014 that\u2019s what decentralization is, is that it\u2019s a very slow and inefficient database, but with that slowness and inefficiency comes maximal redundancy. And with that redundancy comes resistance to large attacks, specifically nation-state level attacks, which would be the most powerful organizations in the world today. So if you needed a medium for high frequency transaction, so you\u2019re always going to get more economy and efficiency by moving to a centralized system like PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Visa, whatever. Because the database only needs to be updated once. Versus Bitcoin has to be replicated everywhere and nowhere across all nodes and miners. So that\u2019s the trade-off and we\u2019ll get into more of that shortly. But in a nutshell I like the description Saylor uses that Bitcoin is a low frequency medium of exchange, meaning you only need to move it occasionally, maybe never if you custody it correctly. But it\u2019s a high frequency store of value. So every time you\u2019re HODLing, you\u2019re using it. So the people who argue that Bitcoin has no utility, they don\u2019t understand this economic principle whatsoever. And further to that, even if you absolutely wanted to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, most tax codes in the world today are hostile to that. They\u2019ll actually trigger capital gains realization at each transaction. [1:39:31] So it really suppresses its use as a medium of exchange. And another way to think about this \u2014 it gets a little more complicated \u2014 but actually when you\u2019re holding something as a store of value, trades are not just with other people. Trades are also with ourselves. Like infinite slices of our future selves. So every time you choose to hold cash or hold Bitcoin or hold gold \u2014 cash in its original sense \u2014 and not trade it, you are basically trading with your future self. So you are giving away the opportunity that the cash could have otherwise been traded for \u2014 whatever its cash value in the market is, it could go out and buy you X assets \u2014 you\u2019re forgoing those assets and choosing to hold the optionality of cash. Whereas those assets may have real yield! They may be productive assets, rent-generating real estate or whatever it may be, whereas hard money doesn\u2019t actually create yield. So you\u2019re actually\u2014the most trades you do in life are not actually with present others but they are with your future self. All these infinite slices of your future self. Every action or inaction even is a set of trades with those future slices of yourself. So we could look at the actual store of value function truly being much more important as a medium of exchange than a present medium of exchange with present others. So that\u2019s just an interesting way to conceive of money, that it\u2019s something that you\u2019re holding onto to have maximum optionality into the future, and that holding is a trade with you even though it\u2019s not a trade with others. And this also dovetailed into why Saylor chooses not to compensate people in Bitcoin and why he thinks it\u2019s a bad idea to do so, because again if you\u2019re using it primarily as a store of value you may not sell it ever or for say at least 100 years. By choosing to compensate people in Bitcoin you\u2019re accelerating that tax bill 100 years into the future, so that\u2019s a really bad idea. You\u2019re also increasing the accounting complexity of the business which would be the payer and the payee. They both need to mark Bitcoin to market at each point of transaction. You\u2019d also be forcing \u2014 say if you\u2019re compensating your employee with Bitcoin \u2014 you\u2019re forcing them to sell it later to actually cover the tax bills generated as a result, so that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. In a nutshell, as Saylor said, the ethos of Bitcoin is self-responsibility. So you should pay and settle in whatever the generally accepted medium of exchange is, the one the tax code is not hostile against, which tends to be currency. And then if you have savings \u2014 you have excess currency or excess assets \u2014 you would, as Saylor does, sweep them into your savings or your treasury for long-term storage. That\u2019s the optimal and intelligent and low-complexity strategy. We get into a bit about how optionality itself is freedom. The more options you have the more free you are. And this has direct impact on the stability of society. Saylor quoted Robert Heiland who said, \u201cAn armed society is a polite society.\u201d So to tie that back to Bitcoin and capital it\u2019s like, when people have this option of capital flight \u2014 they have this perpetual option to move their money across domain, across time, across custodian \u2014 and settle finality nearly instantly, that governments and institutions and service providers, they\u2019re gonna tend to be more respectful because the customer holding the capital has such a high degree of optionality. So you could think about this too: When you go to the amusement park, the food and drink cost in an amusement park tend to be really high. A soda that you may pay $3 for at your local convenience store might be $8\u201310 in that amusement park. And it\u2019s because the amusement park has what\u2019s called a captive audience premium. You have no other choice. You have no other options to buy food or drink once you are within the bounds of that amusement park, and they can effectively charge you monopoly-style prices. And if you look at Bitcoin capital through that lens it\u2019s kind of removing that captive audience premium that legacy institutions or nation states tended to have over users. And we could say that if users have the ability to move the money whenever they want, they don\u2019t actually need to, it\u2019s just the fact that that option exists keeps everyone honest, keeps everyone listening to one another\u2019s preferences, because no one wants the capital to move. So the point of this is that a symmetry of options, a symmetry of optionality between buyer and seller and stability of the rules and the protocols through which they interact, this is the bedrock of peace. This is what preserves peace. But when you get asymmetries, when one group has a lot of optionality over another, that\u2019s when you get predatory treatment. And I would say central banking falls much more into that model, where they get this perpetual call option on society basically, that they can allocate cash into businesses, the shareholders values being increased, the dividends being paid, and if there\u2019s ever a shock to the economy and the institutions that have deployed that capital into risky positions get wiped out, well the central bank just siphons more value from the productive economy through printing money and allocates again. So it\u2019s a Heads I Win, Tails You Lose situation for central banks over productive economies. So Bitcoin is just eliminating this, this captive audience premium or asymmetry of optionality. Another way to think about this too is \u2014 to get back into Bitcoin is Money \u2014 we can actually consider the monetary premium itself on an asset as its optionality value. So the more tradable an asset is, the more a component of its market value is its expected future exchange. So for instance if ammo has a very specific use \u2014 it can be put into a gun and fired and a gun can be used to kill people or animals or whatever \u2014 but if in an environment of ammunition scarcity, people may also be willing to trade other goods and services for that ammunition, so that ammunition will start to trade at a premium not just for its utility value \u2014 not that its utility value has increased necessarily \u2014 but that its exchange value or its optionality value has increased. The extreme example of this would be gold. Gold has a \u2014 I think we\u2019re at an almost $12 Trillion market cap for gold \u2014 the industrial demand for that is less than $2 Trillion, I want to say it\u2019s closer to $1 Trillion. The rest of that demand or the rest of that market cap for gold is reservation demand for gold as money. It best fulfilled the properties of money which made it maximally exchangeable across space and time. In that lens too we could say that Bitcoin is like the world\u2019s first pure money. It\u2019s pure monetary premium. There\u2019s not really an industrial use beneath it. Some have argued that actually the transaction network was kind of the original utility that bootstrapped its monetary premium into existence. Maybe you could make that argument. But the point is that it\u2019s a tool of pure optionality, because it\u2019s pure monetary premium. Whereas you could look at things that are less tradable, where a much larger part of their market value would be their use, their industrial use value versus their trading value. So money exists on this gradient is the point. Something that\u2019s very not-tradable, high non-fungible, very specific \u2014 purple telescopes or something weird like that \u2014 it\u2019d be valued just on its use, mostly just on its use. Not on its future expected exchange value. But something like Bitcoin and money itself \u2014 at the other end of the spectrum \u2014 is valued on its expected future exchange value. I think it was Naval said that Money is the bubble that never pops. Because this delta between market and industrial use value has been called a bubble by some people. But what it actually is underlying that is the value of the monetary properties giving rise to that exchangability. So that got us into Bitcoin as a unit of account. Saylor had a great quote on this. He expects that, \u201cBitcoin will be a universal language of economic truth.\u201d I fully agree! It is the predictability of the supply of money that gives rise to its utility and pricing of goods and services with it. That\u2019s what gold was, it had the most predictable supply of any monetary metal and that\u2019s why all of the liquidity and market capitalization coalesced to gold. And that\u2019s too for that reason we used to think actually in ounces of gold. Even dollars themselves represented ounces of gold originally. The time and energy of market actors that produce every good and service in the world, this tool \u2014 money, or gold \u2014 most closely mapped onto the absolute scarcity of time and energy. So gold was the supply curve that was closest to the absolute immutable perfectly scarce supply curve of time and energy. And this gave it the ability to basically generate prices that were generally the most stable \u2014 not saying that they enforced stability \u2014 but they tended to be most stable because gold had the lowest and most predictable inflation which also meant prices were more useful in calculation. They weren\u2019t fluctuating wildly over time. And they were communicable. So we could actually start to just think in ounces of gold for goods and services instead of needing to think in all these countless exchange ratios \u2014 how many chairs a car is worth or whatever it may have been. So I agree that Bitcoin is gonna go that way. But as far as where it is today \u2014 I love this point \u2014 Saylor was saying there\u2019s a lot of in-fighting in the crypto community about is Bitcoin gonna be the thing or Ethereum or this or that, but it\u2019s all essentially pointless. The crypto-asset ecosystem at the time we recorded was around a $300 Billion pond sitting next to a $300 Trillion ocean of assets which a lot of them are just intended to hold value over time. Store of value assets \u2014 gold, bonds, real estate \u2014 all fall into this ocean. And that\u2019s where our energy should be focused is actually carving a little spill-away from the ocean into the pond here, not competing amongst ourselves because frankly as we\u2019ve covered in previous episodes, Bitcoin is just highly resistant to disruption as money. It\u2019s not like other crypto-assets won\u2019t succeed in something orthogonal to money, something that\u2019s not in the market for money. There\u2019s technology that may have other use cases, there\u2019s a lot of theory out there. But today it\u2019s just not proven! So I agree completely that our focus as educators or ambassadors for Bitcoin needs to be geared towards those still holding and interacting with these other alternative stores of value so they can understand why Bitcoin is possibly the sole store of value asset for the 21st Century, the only way you could successfully transfer value 100 years into the future with the least loss. So I agree with that completely. We then jumped into crypto versus digital networks. Again crypto network we can think of as a decentralized consensus model. And this is using Saylor\u2019s nomenclature: The digital network would be centralized consensus. So just sort of one entity or decision-making body deciding. And there are different use cases for the two and there are different trade-offs between them, clearly. So crypto network would be useful for establishing what Saylor calls immortal sovereignty or antifragility, which means that they are able to persist over time. Decentralized crypto networks have a high degree of survivability and they impart properties like trust-minimization, security, and duration. So you don\u2019t need to trust the centralized decision-making body. Instead you trust the aggregate self-interest of all market actors in a centralized network. And this is clearly gold or this is Bitcoin. Again gold \u2014 it\u2019s not built on cryptography per se, but the inability of producers to create gold in a lab basically meant that the whole world was decentralized around gold as money. There was no political actor that could control it until central banks accumulated a large stake in the supply and started manipulating it in the gold derivatives market which we talked about before. On the other hand of the spectrum from a crypto network is a digital network. Which as opposed to survivability is useful for squeezing efficiency out of a system, eliminating redundancy. Where a decentralized network is gonna be fully redundant\u2014you\u2019re talking about all these nodes and miners all over the world all running a copy of Bitcoin and updating all the time, so it\u2019s a huge expenditure of energy to establish your redundancy \u2014 a digital network is gonna just have one record base that can be updated very quickly, very low latency, very low redundancy. So the properties that it imparts are Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance. And to draw back to \u2014 where you could say gold is decentralized money \u2014 you could say fiat is more like a centralized money. So because gold was expensive to move across space, we could introduce this centralized database on top of it called fiat currency that let us do ledger entries really quickly in gold. So we picked all of this transactability across space but we introduced this attack vector for intermediaries that actually compromised gold\u2019s store of value function over time. The only market-proven crypto network in the world today is non-state digital store of value Bitcoin \u2014 everything else is theoretical. This is not to say that actually a digital network can\u2019t evolve into a crypto network! It kind of reminded me of our earlier discussion of the Steel Age where newly charted industrial spaces tend to have monopolists won out in the beginning, and then those monopolists set standards, and then over time that market becomes commodified and tends back toward a more freely competitive domain based on this standard. So it\u2019s as if a digital network could establish certain protocol standards for a decentralized network and then turn over the keys so to speak to the market. And then if there was sufficient demand for whatever utility it\u2019s providing, it could become decentralized over time if you handled it correctly. We haven\u2019t really seen that yet. We\u2019ve seen some attempts at it but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen it done really cleanly yet. But this evolution, a successful evolution from a digital to a crypto network, would require sufficient differentiation. One that would end up being useful as a competitive advantage in this market-driven natural selection process. Again I think Bitcoin has already run and won the race for money, so it would have to be a different market. And it\u2019s difficult! It\u2019d be really difficult to accomplish this differentiation given Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to absorb a competitor\u2019s feature set. In a biological sense we call this horizontal gene transfer. Where \u2014 Brandon Quittem has written and talked about this \u2014 Mycelium has this ability when it encounters a threat in the environment, if it neutralizes the threat and consumes it, a competing Mycelium or an insect or whatever, it can actually digest its genetic code and incorporate that information into its own genetic code! So we typically think of animals having vertical gene transfer from parent to offspring, but there\u2019s something more competitive in nature \u2014 this horizontal gene transfer where you can just slurp up genetic material from competitors. And Bitcoin exhibits that in the digital domain! So the point is that the differentiation necessary for a digital network to evolve into a crypto network would have to overcome this horizontal gene transfer of Bitcoin as well, which would otherwise just absorb it and render the attempted evolution unnecessary. So finally we got into this concept of immortal sovereignty which I thought was just incredibly interesting. [1:59:33] You can think about this as channeling ones preferences beyond ones own life, and this is not a new idea actually. Saylor gave this general example of: If he wanted to buy flowers for everyone in his family for the next 100 years on their birthday, how would he accomplish that? He drew on examples from John D. Rockefeller and he said, Rockefeller would have established \u2014 using the tech of his time \u2014 to accomplish this \u201cimmortal sovereignty\u201d by either establishing a non-profit foundation, an endowment, a university, or possibly even a national state park. But this necessitated really big numbers and was limited to just a few ultra-rich people that could do it. And again these are \u2014 when Rockefeller was alive I guess almost 100 years ago now, you\u2019re talking about $100 Million in assets with $5 Million a year operating budget in 1920 Dollars. So big, big numbers were necessary to achieve this immortal sovereignty that Bitcoin delivers to us in a much more cost-effective way today! Additionally, no matter what you set up \u2014 foundation, endowment, university \u2014 you would still encounter this counterparty risk because you\u2019d have to trust the institution, you\u2019d have to trust the government protecting the institution. But Bitcoin gives us an interesting thing which is a monetary layer that enables us to dematerialize these institutions but still achieve similar \u2014 this immortal sovereignty if you will. And it does because you can actually assign the trustees \u2014 in say a multisig setup \u2014 keys to the funds to accomplish the aims of the digital foundation. But because their property rights wouldn\u2019t be exposed to counterparty risk in the form of an institution or a government, they would actually gain a great deal of dynamism to roll with or get through geopolitical changes such that they could preserve the original mission of that institution. So you could think of it as immortal sovereignty at just a much lower cost! Which I think just speaks to the grander vision of Bitcoin, right? It\u2019s like: Why do we have these stories like the nation state and universities organizing us, and what is possible when we instead maximize the sovereignty of the individual? Like how relevant do those institutions remain? The other example he gave is if you wanted to host your website reading material for 1,000 years into the future, you could code all kinds of interesting rules around that! Maybe requiring people to pass a test and become a certified student of your knowledge, and then maybe they gain a voting right to choose the next trustee of the institution, and it becomes this dynamic digital autonomous democratic organization that just rolls forward in time. It\u2019s really wild when you imagine the possibilities. It points towards all the new institutional possibilities enabled by Bitcoin. Which in my opinion it calls into question the structure and the purpose of the firm today. So Bitcoin gives us this monetary layer capable of dematerializing these institutions we\u2019ve needed in the past for sovereignty, to establish what Saylor called immortal sovereignty. And it does it in a way that empowers the trustees of these organizations to be self-sovereign, so that they can actually resist geopolitical sea changes and adapt to changes in political climates of the time. Whereas historically you would\u2019ve needed to trust that institution itself, and should it be invaded in wartime or broken down due to a civil dispute within the country, then you would\u2019ve lost the sovereignty that you would\u2019ve vested trust in the state park or whatever the will you were trying to project beyond your life \u2014 its fate would\u2019ve been vested with the survivability of the sovereignty of that institution. So Bitcoin\u2014by being a monetary base layer that maximizes the sovereignty of individuals and being optimized for survivability \u2014actually gives us a whole new way of establishing this immortal sovereignty across time! Another way to think about that is: Bitcoin is collapsing the cost of money, it\u2019s collapsing transaction cost, it\u2019s collapsing the costs of satisfying the functions of the central bank, and it also just collapses this cost of immortal sovereignty. Which again, the Rockefeller\u2019s needed $100 Million in assets and a $5 Million annual operating budget to achieve to establish the Rockefeller Foundation. Now you can do that in theory at least with just a much smaller Bitcoin stash, some software, and some really long-term strategic thinking! So I like the analogy too that Saylor used: If you wanted to host your website reading materials for the course of 1,000 years, you could actually chop up the keys to that institution \u2014 the Bitcoin endowment for that institution \u2014 give it to 5 trustees, encode a set of rules such that people have to read your materials and pass a test to maybe gain a voting right so that they get to decide the [successor] to each trustee. And in that way the thing kind of becomes this decentralized autonomous organization over time that just preserves your will and testament which was to have this body of knowledge go into the future for the benefit of humanity. So I thought that was really cool and points to just the new possibilities that Bitcoin brings into the world! It not only causes us to question the purpose of the firm itself and other organizational models we use, but it\u2019s also creating something that\u2019s truly timeless. And this is where\u2014 Saylor called this, Creating monuments in cyberspace \u2014 I thought that was a really cool way to look at it, is that by gaining immortal sovereignty through Bitcoin-enabled institutions, we can actually create things that well-outlive us yet still are shaped and influenced by our living will and testment beyond our own life. Finally we got into a topic we touched on earlier which was that money is power. And we combined it with another topic that we touched on previously which was that sufficiently advanced technology is magic. So by combining these two concepts we\u2019d say that a sufficiently advanced monetary technology is magical power, effectively! And it lets its users cast spells or cast curses. On the spell side we went into this park in Naples that as Saylor described was surrounded by wealth but for whatever reason was not receiving an allocation of that wealth to preserve the park and keep it pristine. So again to establish that immortal sovereignty historically they had to go out and buy up this land and basically turn it into national parks because they were then vesting their will and testament with the longest-lived sovereign power of the time \u2014 which was the nation state \u2014 to maximize the chances of preserving their intention across time. The point there was that the 501c3 non-profit foundation laws \u2014 they were actually written by Rockefeller\u2019s attourneys! So this shows the relationship between money and government. The common misconception is that the government is the originator of money, but what is in fact true is that money is the originator of government! That wealth itself tends to shape the laws around it that determine its management, preservation, and distribution over time. On the other side where we were talking about casting a curse \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk a lot about this but just thinking out loud, if you had an organization like Anonymous, which is this anonymous set of computer hackers distributed all over the world, you could in theory fund them in perpetuity with a Bitcoin-based smart contract enabled endowment that would effectively fund their hacking attempts or attempts to say dissolve the power structures of government or to remedy any government mistreatment of civilians \u2014 things like that. So it could be used in both a defensive way \u2014 say to defend the park in Naples \u2014 but it could also be used offensively to attack hostile organizations like national government. So that\u2019s just an incredible way to think about how many ways Bitcoin not only shapes and influences our willpower and intention by lowering our time preference and elevating our morality, but also gives us this medium through which to project it over much longer time and space horizons! So it really is one of those tools that is just radically shaping who we are. We touched on the religious aspects of Bitcoin, but even if you just strip that out and said it\u2019s just an ideology, it is perhaps one of the most pure and principled ideologies there\u2019s ever been! If you respect Fairness, Equality, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Mathematics, Freedom \u2014 that\u2019s what Bitcoin positively embodies essentially! And such a pure and pristine ideology is something people find worth fighting and even dying for. So it does have these qualities of a religion or of its own independent nation state if you will. It\u2019s just challenging all of our language even to describe what it is. Although we focus on its monetary properties exploring it as money by asking this question, What is Money?, I think we come to see Bitcoin as even much more than that. Or perhaps even saying money is much more than that! Money is foundational. It\u2019s like the base operating system to all these other higher order operating systems we have like the nation states and religious institutions, etc. As I said once before, people come to Bitcoin for the profits, I think almost everyone\u2019s drawn in by Number Go Up, but I think the people that really come and stay and find roots in Bitcoin and purpose and meaning and devoting their lives to this space, they stay for the principles! Bitcoin \u2014 come for the profits, stay for the principles. So that was it, that was Episode 8 guys. I hope you enjoyed that one. This has just been a dynamite series so far. We\u2019ve got at least one episode left so I look forward to that and I\u2019ll see you at the next one!"}

We are back with Saylor Series Episode 7! Today we will be diving even deeper into Bitcoin theory and as always if you guys haven\u2019t seen Episodes 1\u20136 that led us to this point I highly suggest you go and check those out. They build a lot of foundation that we draw upon continually as we progress further into this series. So today we\u2019re gonna discuss Bitcoin as a monetary missile, which if you remember from Episode 1, missiles are one of the quintessential Stone Age technologies so we draw analogies to that. We also talk about Bitcoin as the creature that never sleeps. Again to the great Kraken itself and why this makes it a superior form of money. We\u2019ll also look at the effects of humans intervening into complex systems and what that does to complex systems and the consequences that it generates. And finally we\u2019ll look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin may actually be the sole sound store of value for the 21st Century, we\u2019ll compare it to alternatives and draw the reasons why it is superior across a number of dimensions. Then we\u2019ll get into the Talebian concept of via negativa and how it relates to Bitcoin and technology more generally. Finally we get into a really interesting aspect of Bitcoin not often discussed. And that is the \u2014 we look into the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a value creator for this asset class itself. And that leads us naturally into discussion of Bitcoin as a religion. We\u2019re gonna go deep again today. I\u2019m really excited for this one. So let\u2019s dive in!"}

This is extremely high bandwidth price discovery and transparency, right? The highest bandwidth price discovery, the highest bandwidth market of any security, of any asset ever! I mean, Bitcoin really is the perfected asset, or at least the apex asset in the financial jungle, because it\u2019s the creature that never sleeps, that\u2019s an octopus that\u2019s working everywhere all the time. The metaphor \u2014 Kraken \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty good metaphor because it\u2019s always going and it\u2019s never stopping. And remember back to our previous discussion, I was saying in Jurassic Park the guy picks a fight with the little dinosaur and then he realizes that there\u2019s a hundred of those little dinosaurs and they don\u2019t sleep. And when you pick a fight with a swarm and the swarm doesn\u2019t sleep and you sleep, you realize you\u2019re gonna lose! You\u2019re doomed! There\u2019s that point you\u2019re gonna realize you\u2019re doomed because you can\u2019t keep up with a software creature with a million heads that is continuously working everywhere all the time. And here\u2019s the thing you know: the thing that\u2019s working that\u2019s dominating the market in Bitcoin all the time \u2014 it\u2019s the strongest version of the creature in that domain, not the weakest! The weak parts of the herd get culled out, they\u2019re being deprived of their capital, they\u2019re being squeezed out. You see it with the Mt. Gox disaster \u2014 anything that doesn\u2019t quite work. And so this asset class is a living asset class. And it\u2019s strength comes from the fact that it\u2019s being developed \u2014 it\u2019s not constrained by the lowest common denominator, it\u2019s strengthened by the highest common denominator! If there\u2019s somebody in the world, if there\u2019s an exchange in the world that can actually do this better, faster, stronger and it comes onto the Bitcoin network, they will set the price. Even if you\u2019re just HODLing, if you\u2019re just sitting there holding an asset \u2014 let\u2019s say I\u2019m HODLing $100 Million of Bitcoin and I\u2019m wishing it would go up in value. And then let\u2019s say there\u2019s a million kazillion laws in the United States that prevent people from trading index futures on Bitcoin. But somebody in Malta is able to do it, or somebody in Singapore is able to launch that exchange. So Singapore launches an exchange that matches billions of dollars of forward index buyers or option buyers to billions of dollars of call buyers, and that attracts tens of billions of dollars of capital in the market because it solves the yield curve problem. Let\u2019s say hypothetically somebody on a centralized or decentralized or Lightning Network exchange solves the yield curve problem. If I could give you 8% risk-free yield on 10-year money, presumably you can take $100 Billion and you can take that money and you can short fiat. Short the dollar, go long the Bitcoin, squeeze the 8% yield on $100 Billion, make yourself $8 Billion a year. If you can figure out how to do that in Singapore, you set up in Singapore, you do it in Singapore \u2014 what happens to the price of Bitcoin? Goes up! What happens to the HODLer sitting in Schenectady, New York \u2014 that never did anything, that didn\u2019t touch it, that doesn\u2019t know about it, that doesn\u2019t understand it \u2014 with their little 1 Bitcoin?"}

They all have that immunity. That\u2019s herd immunity, whatever that might be. And that\u2019s the beauty of Bitcoin. I had this Tweet\u2014I put it out there, I said, You know, lions get tired of chasing the antelope. Lions complain to the ranger. The ranger hobbles the antelope. Lions get fat, dumb, and happy. Antelope all die. Lions all die. Ranger blames it on the weather! And that is a metaphor for a lot of stuff. Generally it\u2019s a metaphor for how you destroy a crypto network by trying to make transaction fees lower. It\u2019s like, Someone complained about transaction fees so we tried to change everything to drive the transaction fees down because somehow it\u2019s an abomination in the eyes of God that people get charged for transactions! The antelope ran too fast! Not fair! Slow them down! The transaction fees were too high! Not fair! Make them lower! We\u2019ll hobble them for you. Okay? It\u2019s also a metaphor for interest rates. Interest rates are too high! I can\u2019t afford a loan! Make them go down! It\u2019s also a metaphor for competition. My competitor goes too fast! They\u2019re making it too difficult! Slow them down! Make the foreigners stop that! Make somebody do something! Right? It\u2019s somebody trying to regulate or manage something because they think it\u2019s a problem. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re messing with Mother Nature. You\u2019re in a war with Nature\u2014it\u2019s not gonna end well. At the end of the day lazy lions should die, and slow antelope get eaten, and fast, strong, healthy antelope procreate, and fast, strong, healthy lions feed, and the lions get better, and the antelope get better, and they live in an ecosystem.

We\u2019re back to this issue of: Zoom was inevitable. YouTube was inevitable. Virtual business models were inevitable. Bitcoin was inevitable. But it sure did get accelerated by certain things that happened! Bitcoin had 10 years of I would say a 7% forcing function with the dollar, and it got goosed a bit harder with Argentina and other developing world countries and, you know, the anxieties of Syria and the anxieties of Iraq and the anxiety in Africa and the anxiety in South America and the like, so those stressors \u2014 that goosed it. And the currency wars pushed it a bit harder. And then I think the pandemic crisis lit it on fire! I could say Robert, like, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m talking to you if there\u2019s no pandemic!

Bitcoin is an incredible store of value. I think that\u2019s its primary use case, or its killer value proposition now and probably for the next decade \u2014 maybe forever! The entire world is looking for a store of value right now, and you have to look across $250 Trillion of assets. If we think that asset inflation is running north of 10% \u2014 and I think it is, I think it\u2019s pretty clear it is \u2014 and if you have capital, you have to choose between bonds, $80 Trillion in sovereign debt or corporate debt or municipal debt, or mortgage-backed securities, or you gotta choose equities, tech equity, conventional equity, or you gotta go to precious metals, or you go to real property, real estate property. And when you look at all of those things, the problem is half of all real estate is impaired because of the political response to COVID, and it\u2019s not likely that\u2019s gonna change in the next 10 years. We\u2019ve probably got 10 years of uncertainty about real estate assets, especially commercial real estate assets. The other challenge with real estate is the taxes on it. It\u2019s illiquid, immobile, and highly taxed. Generally real estate is taxed annually everywhere, it\u2019s just a question of whether it\u2019s 20 basis points or 200 basis points. So that makes real estate a challenging store of value. And that takes you to bonds: Bonds have worked as a store of value when the interest rates keep going lower. You can see that everybody that\u2019s been on the bond train and benefiting from it, they\u2019re screaming as loud as they can: They want negative interest rates! Because they\u2019re like \u2014 The secret to success is lower the interest rates 50 basis points a year or 100 basis points a year and it\u2019s a no-lose proposition \u2014 for them. But at this point it\u2019s getting kind of ridiculous silly because when interest rates go negative everybody takes their money out of the bank, it creates bank runs, all the bank systems break. It\u2019s kind of a morally bankrupt \u2014 I mean a lot of people, they don\u2019t really understand that they\u2019re being abused at 2% instead of 5%. But pretty much everybody can figure out that when you\u2019re being billed 1% of the money you have at a bank, you\u2019re being abused!"}

It takes us to equity. We\u2019ve got an equity bubble that\u2019s a very crowded trade, but the real issue with equity as a store of value is that the revenue gets taxed as sales tax, the cash flows get taxed as income tax, the expenses \u2014 the cost structure gets taxed as employee and payroll tax. Then the trade gets taxed \u2014 there\u2019s a tariff. Then you have the existential threat or regulatory risk of onerous regulations. Pick up the paper and see maybe Australia\u2019s gonna bill Google every time they link to a newspaper article, and then if Google doesn\u2019t link the newspaper articles they\u2019re gonna get fined for not linking the newspaper articles! And as these things become more powerful, they become regulated utilities and politicians start to think that they can and should be regulated \u2014 and maybe with good cause! If there\u2019s only one provider of information anywhere in the country then it definitely becomes a political issue. So that\u2019s the challenge with equities: they might work for 2, 3, 4 years, but they\u2019re valued as a multiple of cash flows. So if all of the liquidity of the civilization gets squeezed out of debt \u2014 when interest gets to zero \u2014 the government and the Fed owns all the debt. Okay, they bought me out \u2014 now I gotta put it in something else so I jump on equities so now equities double. But now the P/Es double or triple, and the revenue multiples triple. What\u2019s the value of an equity? The value of equity should in theory be tangible assets on the balance sheet plus the sum of the discounted cash flows. And so people are using equities as store of value today. In fact you could make the argument that equities are the most popular store of value for the majority with their Robinhood trading \u2014 they\u2019re all buying Apple, Amazon, Facebook, NASDAQ, SPDRs \u2014 everybody! Even though nobody thinks revenues are going up this year, nobody thinks earnings are going up this year, but equity values have doubled this year. Well that means that they\u2019re getting riskier! So if you contrast Bitcoin to equity, the problem is: if the price of an equity goes up by a factor of 10, you\u2019ve got more risk because it\u2019s delaminating from its underlying cash flows and its fundamentals. Because it is a centralized, regulated entity, and the only way that the cash flows are going to grow into that value is they keep raising the price. And if they\u2019re a monopoly and the raise the price, the regulators will react. If they don\u2019t raise the price, they can\u2019t grow into the multiple! And so you kind of have a chicken and the egg thing, right? And if there\u2019s any competition and their cash flows deteriorate, eventually you\u2019re trading at 200:1 or 200 P/E, and then any degree of disappointment causes massive volatility. And how are they different than Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is the liquidity, it is the store of value \u2014 that is it! If you\u2019re going to function as money, you want to be a single-celled organism \u2014 like the algae of the ecosystem. The base layer of the ecosystem that\u2019s plankton or bacteria or single cells. You don\u2019t want to be a vertebrate! And these companies are vertebrates with a brain and a backbone, and that means \u2014 for example, WeChat or TikTok has a headquarters \u2014 and if it\u2019s in the wrong country, it gets its head chopped off. And Apple and Facebook, they\u2019re subject to a certain court, a certain country\u2019s jurisdiction. So that means they\u2019re foreigners somewhere else! They\u2019re vertebrate. If you\u2019re a vertebrate, I can kill you with a needle. A human being I can figure out how to kill: there\u2019s a heart, I take a needle, I poke there \u2014 you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re very fragile. Hard to do that with a swarm of hornets. Hard to do that with all the plankton in the ocean. It\u2019s very difficult to do it with an amorphous decentralized invertebrate of some sort. So if you want a store of value, you don\u2019t want a company that\u2019s valued based upon the ability to engineer hyper-complicated products that have to keep getting upgraded. You want something which is simple, that can just keep things simple. This is again where some of the crypto-enthusiasts, they keep wanting to tinker with a better blockchain, a better crypto. You know, they never saw an upgrade they didn\u2019t like so they just wanna keep revving it every year. Like it\u2019s the iPhone version 37. There\u2019s a fundamental difference, which is: if there\u2019s a bug in the iPhone version 37, everybody in the world\u2019s heart doesn\u2019t stop!"}

I think this analogy you\u2019re using with the simplicity of plankton being the base layer for the ecosystem is apt. I want to say plankton makes up the majority of the biomass on the planet by a pretty substantial margin because it\u2019s so simple and it\u2019s so efficient at converting solar energy into biological energy. And then it is the base layer for this multiplicity of layered ecosystem that we have in the world. And another thing I think is interesting is that you make a great point that equities are becoming more risky as they increase in price, because they\u2019re delaminating from their valuation fundamentals as you said. And Bitcoin\u2019s the opposite. Actually the more valuable Bitcoin is, the more secure it\u2019s network, the greater the liquidity, the more resistant it is to attack. So it\u2019s a very interesting counter-trade to equities as a store of value."}

But maybe everybody in your home country loves you! But what about everybody in every other country? So you don\u2019t want a head, and you don\u2019t want to be a target, and you don\u2019t want to be valued based on cash flows if you\u2019re going to be money. They\u2019re the right creature to be building a device or maybe creating an exchange or creating an application, because \u2014 there \u2014 I want the software to run a billion times faster, and so it\u2019s okay to have one company write software! The question is: I want it to run a billion times faster, but do I need it to last for a thousand years?

If I put all the energy of civilization into a crypto network, I can\u2019t afford for someone to, like, ship a buggy release! And again, what people forget is: if I put $1 Billion into Bitcoin on January 1st, 2021 and I don\u2019t touch it for 100 years, the thing is working! Truly insanely great technology is \u2014 okay we\u2019re back to Nicholas Taleb haunting our thoughts \u2014 via negativa, right? Add by taking away. Insanely great technology is when it does a thing without you doing a thing! You know, a junior technologist, they create gadgets. I have a mobile application that has 150 features and 150 buttons and then you click and there\u2019s a billion different things it can do depending upon the combination of the buttons and the features you click on\u2014okay that\u2019s one thing. How about another mobile app? You download a mobile app and everywhere you walk on Earth it kills all your enemies and gives you infinite food and water and protection and plays whatever music you wanted to hear around you without you touching it \u2014 hands-free. If I walk around and someone walks behind me and they do everything I want before I ask them to do it \u2014 without me opening my mouth \u2014 isn\u2019t that a heck of a lot better than a gadgety thing with features?"}

That\u2019s a truly great piece of software: You ask the wrong question and it gives you the right answer because it knows which question you should\u2019ve asked and it knows how you should\u2019ve spelled it and said, We\u2019re gonna answer this question for you instead because the odds that you really wanted to know this question answered is 99,000,000:1! The odds that you really were asking a unique question that seems foolish and misspelling a popular name while you\u2019re asking it\u2014that\u2019s 1 in a billion! So if you really wanted to ask the wrong question the wrong way you try it twice, but 99.999% of the time they give you the right answer to the wrong question and they do it because they built this very fault-tolerant, common-sense, rational interface. So back to store of value, right? Bitcoin is an ideal store of value because it\u2019s got the ability to convey your energy not across 10,000 miles but across 10,000 days. 30 years into the future. 100 years into the future. Most people when they\u2019re investing in assets, they\u2019re taking this very short term view of like the next month, the next year, the next two years, and I find that if you\u2019re looking at a 3-year time frame, everything gets very very noisy and complicated and there\u2019s all these debates. But if you really want to end the debates, go out to 100 years and just take $100 Million and go through the exercise of giving it to someone \u2014 your heir\u2019s heir\u2019s heir in 100 years. And then all of a sudden, all this noise drops away. Can I put it into real estate? No, it\u2019ll be taxed out of existence in 100 years. Can I put it in gold? No, 98% of it will be gone if 100% of it isn\u2019t gone in 100 years because we mine it to death. Can I put it into fiat? No it\u2019s gonna be inflated to death. Can I invest it in a company? No, name one company that\u2019s around today that was around 100 years ago that hasn\u2019t been diluted, recapitalized, etc. Can I put it in a stock index? Well, you\u2019re trusting a human being to rebalance the index over and over again. What stock index do you trust for the next 100 years? And by the way it\u2019s got counterparty risk at the nation state level. The nation might not be there, and 90% didn\u2019t make it! So what are you left with? And the truth is, when you just do that thought experiment it\u2019s pretty obvious: You would put it in a crypto network, in a decentralized proof of work network if the adherents \u2014 the maximalists \u2014 were fanatic zealots about protecting the integrity of the network against meddlers who would screw it up. If the network is supported by those with a religious conviction to the network such that you could imagine 100 years from now there will still be people protecting the network \u2014 the phrase is, Keepers of the flame. Every great religion, every great institution has keepers of the flame, and there must be passion. Do you believe in your religion? Do you believe strong enough that you\u2019ll flee persecution to continue to practice it? The United States was built on the foundation of separation of church and state, and it\u2019s a pretty important and interesting metaphor: People came here because they could practice their religion! That\u2019s why they came here! And they came here because their religion was above their government. They would not sacrifice whatever it is they believed in. If you look at every institution that lasts more than 100 years \u2014 name them: Harvard University, Cambridge, Oxford, the Catholic Church, Islamic sects, the Jewish faith \u2014 there\u2019s not that many! There\u2019s churches or religious sects and then there\u2019s some educational institutions \u2014 and I see the educational institutions being shaken at their core this year! I mean literally you could\u2019ve said for 500 years \u2014 Ivy Leagues, the elite universities \u2014 they\u2019re stalwart institutions. They have lost a huge amount of credibility this year! When you send all of your students home and you close the campus and people are studying virtually, people\u2019s affiliation to the bricks and mortar of the institution has been dramatically weakened unless they morph into a virtual institution. The virtual institutions by the way have dramatically strengthened, right? Your affiliation with YouTube and Facebook and Apple TV and Bitcoin and Square Cash has dramatically strengthened. If it\u2019s virtual. And your affiliation with the bricks and mortar physical institution has been weakened. And those that will survive have dematerialized and virtualized and they\u2019ve learned how to project their ethos in cyberspace. So yeah, back to the store of value: You need people \u2014 human beings, flesh and blood people \u2014 that are going to keep the flame. And the flame of Bitcoin is the node and the mining rig. We\u2019re getting into Bitcoin as religion or as faith now, but imagine 1,000 years ago, I want to keep a religion alive \u2014 I have an altar in my home. Every wealthy person had a chapel in their home. If you look at religions, go to the Far East, there are altars in Buddhist, Shinto, other faiths. So the idea of an altar or a shrine or a cathedral or a church \u2014 these are structures where people go to worship, and the worshiping is the feeding of the flame. And oftentimes during the worshiping they\u2019re tithing and they\u2019re channeling 10% of their money as energy into these religions in order to keep them relevant! If you look at fantasy fiction, in fantasy where they have gods, the strength of the god is a function of the devoutness of the worshipers, of the followers. Such and such was worshiped as the god of the forest, and they are worshiped as the god of the forest and all of their adherents \u2014 all their acolytes \u2014 are feeding energy to the god of the forest. And when they\u2019re no longer worshiped, their energy goes away! If you lose your faithful, if they won\u2019t feed you with the fire of truth, with the energy that you need, your efficacy falls and you die. And so how do you feed a fire, right? If it\u2019s a physical fire you have to throw wood on the fire. How do you feed a religion? You have to tithe \u2014 the Catholic Church, or any church \u2014 you have to give it money, and maybe you have to give it your life service. Onward Christian soldiers! I will fight for the cause. I will donate to the cause. That\u2019s how you feed a religious institution. How do you feed a crypto network? You gotta spin up facilities of encrypted energy that adhere to the protocol. Every time a miner comes onboard it\u2019s feeding the fire. Every time a node comes onboard it\u2019s gonna certify and validate. It\u2019s protecting. It\u2019s creating one more chain in the fault-tolerance structure. And that\u2019s why a smaller crypto \u2014 a crypto that\u2019s a technical experiment, that\u2019s an application \u2014 isn\u2019t the good store of value. Because if the people are willing to fork it, if they\u2019re willing to fork it and abandon it in order to [move to 48:44] a new technology, then the flame dies. And so it\u2019s pretty clear that Bitcoin maximalists, they have a lot of the faith and the conviction of true believers in any religious faith for the past 2,000 years. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Because they share the same values. Their values are: Truth, Nature, Natural Laws, Laws of Physics, Laws of Thermodynamics, Math, Austrian Economics, No such thing as a free lunch, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology Advances. They share those values. They\u2019re taking their monetary energy and tokenizing it on a Bitcoin network with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is that single shared store of value. If money is energy and energy begets life and a crypto decentralized network gives you sovereignty, that\u2019s a path to immortality, and that means that everybody in the Bitcoin community that believes in this for the long term is engaged in the pursuit of immortal life. And pursuit of immortal life sounds like a religious mantra, I think! And I grew up in the Southern Baptist faith so I\u2019m very familiar with the ideology of Christianity and pursuit of immortal life is pretty paramount there."}

And so all religious traditions, mythological traditions, are stories pointing toward a higher truth. And I find it interesting that Bitcoin has higher truth embedded in code! This 21 Million number is quite literally transcendental: We can\u2019t touch it, we can\u2019t change it, we can\u2019t do anything about it. Every 10 minutes it\u2019s promulgating the most indisputable truth that we\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s true global consensus.

So the solution there is: You move from 3 years to 10 years, and then you move from 10 years to 100 years. And at the 100-year time frame it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s an asset and what\u2019s a store of value! And it\u2019s just very obvious: (A) Bitcoin is a store of value if its believers have religious conviction in it. It becomes very simple. Now, if you step out to a 1,000-year time frame and you say, What\u2019s this thing gotta be in order to last 1,000 years? It better be the worship of Math and the Laws of Thermodynamics and the Laws of Physics and Einstein and Newton! That might make it!

People have been studying and honoring Math and Algebra for 2,000 years, they\u2019ve been honoring Calculus for 400 years. You could say this is truly the adoption of economics as a science. It\u2019s that critical inflection point where economics went from being a political preference to being a science, and if you adopt it as a science then you actually get massive advantages technically.

That was Episode 7 with Michael Saylor here on the Saylor Series. And wow what an episode! We have gone really deep into the topic of Bitcoin and I think we had a really strong finish today. So I\u2019m just gonna run through a few of the things we talked about. We started out with this concept of Bitcoin as a monetary missile, and this took me back to Episode 1 when we were talking about fire, missiles, and hydraulics being these primary Stone Age technologies that allowed mankind to come into dominance in the world. And I thought the analogy was very interesting that, using Bitcoin we have this ultimate high ground behind a wall of encrypted energy, but we can also accelerate our monetary energy and deploy it anywhere in the world across any domain nearly instantly with virtually no frictions at all. And so not only does it give us this advantage of asymmetric terrain, but we also get maximal force with how we deploy that monetary energy in the generation of capital. So I thought that was a super-apt analogy. And then we talked about how that effectively makes Bitcoin the highest bandwidth price discovery, transparency, and security asset in the world. So we have this pure money that propagates pure price signals so it would allow for pure price discovery \u2014 all of that is premised on the open source ethos, which is essentially just absolute transparency \u2014 and that gives it the ultimate security. So there\u2019s a bit of a paradox there, it\u2019s that: By being totally open to inspection, Bitcoin actually resists manipulation or emulation even, in that everything about it is out in the open. So it\u2019s more a quality of its network effects, its liquidity, its first-mover advantage, even actually the disappearance of Satoshi which we\u2019ll get into a little bit later \u2014 all of these things sort of wrap this open technology in an apparently disruption-proof casing. So I thought that was a really powerful discussion point. And Saylor calls Bitcoin, The creature that never sleeps. We have this swarm intelligence, if you will, that never stops growing, changing, adapting, trading \u2014 it is just a fully autonomous and perpetual monetary network competing against these other monetary networks that are rigidly controlled in certain time windows. And to his point, an individual organism has to sleep, but a swarm creature does not! So the swarm creature necessarily out-competes the individual organism because it doesn\u2019t need to sleep. It just keeps adapting, growing, becoming more fit. And as we know from Darwin, it\u2019s the most fit competitor that wins out in an ecosystem. And I thought this was a great point too and I never thought of it this way, that: In a swarm, the weakest elements are actually weeded out. So it\u2019s constantly sacrificing its weaker elements to natural selection and thereby strengthening the ensemble. Whereas the individual organism is subject to any singular attack vector. If its defense is penetrated, the whole entity or organism is lost. [1:02:17] So in that way centralized entities are only as strong as their weakest link, or as Saylor says, Are constrained by their lowest common denominator. Whereas a decentralized entity like the swarm is gonna be strengthened by its highest common denominator. So we can think about this as kind of like something that learns at the edges. So if one member of the swarm figures out how to effectively deal with a predator or a threat, then it will tend to reproduce and its genes will be replicated into the rest of the swarm. So the entire decentralized entity or organism is actually learning at the edges and incorporating those lessons into its whole body. Whereas the centralized entity, if it encounters a predator it doesn\u2019t know how to deal with or even figures out how to defeat, it doesn\u2019t spread that adaptivity to the rest of its body, essentially. It\u2019s just a one-to-one relationship versus the one-to-many. So the one-to-many gives it just much more intelligence and adaptivity in the long run. And tying this back to Bitcoin, it\u2019s as if \u2014 to Saylor\u2019s point \u2014 any market participant in the Bitcoin network figures out a way to deliver a solution smarter, faster, stronger, better, that\u2019s where the capital will flow! Because again, the capital is unrestricted. It is not siloed to any particular jurisdiction or institution \u2014 individuals have maximal sovereignty over their Bitcoin capital so they can move it anywhere in the world. So in his example of: Say someone is setting up a centralized or decentralized institution in Singapore for instance that solves the yield curve problem \u2014 so matching lenders and borrowers of Bitcoin in a way that establishes a long term yield curve for Bitcoin \u2014 that this would create all of a sudden this risk-free rate on Bitcoin which is the one thing that it lacks, as we discussed in earlier episodes, to make it a truly pristine collateral that would be competitive to say US Treasuries. So Bitcoin currently just doesn\u2019t have a yield. But if you could match borrowers and lenders you could actually create that curve. So his point was, Say we create this 8% risk-free rate on Bitcoin on 10-year money which could be used\u2014and you have fiat deprecating at say 2% a year best-case \u2014 then all of a sudden this opens up an attack vector on fiat where you could actually go long Bitcoin and short the Dollar and squeeze the difference in yield. This is called a speculative attack. And this would have the effect of strengthening the speculative attacker himself, but it would also strengthen the HODLer in Schenectady or in whatever town that doesn\u2019t know anything about this, just by virtue of more price appreciation pressure being applied to Bitcoin. So more energy being drawn into the network actually benefits all network participants! And this is contrary to a centralized entity. And if you flip this back to the Great Wall of China example, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve inverted that security model. So whereas the Great Wall of China \u2014 it\u2019s just a perimeter defense, it doesn\u2019t adapt, and if you can penetrate at any point of it the whole defensible area is lost, that\u2019s actually what happened when the Mongols penetrated the gate\u2014whereas Bitcoin is effectively this swarm intelligence. So any network participant that can figure something out is benefiting the entire network, and then you\u2019ve also further capitalized or further energized those network participants to go out and solve other problems on behalf of other network participants. So there\u2019s this virtuous cycle built right into it that just does not exist with any other form of money. [1:06:33] Then we take a bit of a pivot and we got into how human intervention negatively and adversely impacts complex systems. And Saylor gave the example of the lions complaining that the antelopes are too fast so the hunter hobbles the antelope. The lions kill all of the antelope, get lazy because they aren\u2019t being pushed to their limits, so then after all the antelope are eliminated, the lions starve to death and then the hunter blames it on the weather! This is a core concept in Talebs\u2019 books where he says that human intervention moves us from what he calls Mediocristan to Extremistan. Meaning essentially that the non-linearity of effects goes through the roof once we try to intervene in natural systems, because there are all these dynamic equilibria that we\u2019re unaware of. And when we offset, when we try and press one lever to cause one result, there\u2019s a cascade of unintended consequences surrounding that. One common example here is called the Cobra problem. And you can look this up on, say, Wikipedia, but the gist of it is that \u2014 I forget what country \u2014 but they had a problem with an overpopulation of cobras, so they passed a law that offered a ransom for every dead cobra brought to the government \u2014 they\u2019d give you $10 \u2014 whatever it was. And this had the unintended consequence of incentivizing people to actually start breeding cobras and killing them and then to take them into the government and get this reward! So it actually further exacerbated the overpopulation problem and financially compromised the local government. So that\u2019s just one example where good intentions go awry, and history is just full of these! So tying that back into money: I guess you could say the central bank or interest rate manipulation \u2014 intentionality aside \u2014 we could possibly argue that it was done with the attempt to make things better. You can argue both sides of that. Let\u2019s just say for instance that it was done with good and wholesome intentions to benefit the economy or stimulate demand or keep prices stable and unemployment low and predictable and all these things. That still \u2014 when you\u2019re talking about suppressing interest rates to induce money creation and borrowing \u2014 you\u2019re going to war with the temporal and energetic principles of thermodynamics, because again the price of money\u2014the interest rate \u2014 is the price of time! I\u2019m gonna give you money now that you\u2019re gonna give me back later. There\u2019s a price associated with that which you\u2019re paying me\u2014it\u2019s called the interest rate. If a centralized body is artificially suppressing that, you\u2019re actually trying to \u2014 and what Saylor said \u2014 was to reverse the flow of time. You\u2019re discounting the price of time! And this has just so many disastrous unintended consequences around it! Which we went into. You\u2019re pushing back against thermodynamics, which is the inviolable rule set of the universe. And I would argue that, actually, trying to suppress the price of time causes us to discount the value of our own time and the time of others. You could say time or energy, actually. And I think that is kind of the culprit at the heart of this moral hazard related to fiat currencies, is that we\u2019re discounting time and energy, which is the intrinsic value of human beings, effectively. And that\u2019s the one case by the way where I use the term intrinsic value, because I do think humans are the only intrinsically valued \u2014 you could probably expand that to life more generally \u2014 but there\u2019s no objects that have intrinsic value, value is subjective, but life itself as living beings, that seems to be an absolute is that we should have value for life! Anyways, bit of a philosophical aside. And in that way this organism aspect \u2014 actually discounting the value of life \u2014 we see all the moral hazard that central banking has created, all the warfare its funded, it\u2019s as if Bitcoin is an autoimmune response, somehow, from society to central banking. As Saylor said, clearly the message in the Genesis Block solidifies that. And he goes a little bit deeper actually to say that Satoshi was clearly an individual sensitive to these negative socioeconomic consequences of central banking, and his own sensitivity was a response to the sensitivity of others: People who had been marginalized or victimized by the system throughout the ages. You could call that a form of inflammation, basically, in the socioeconomic super-organism. And then Satoshi was just the cell of the organism that figured it out! He figured out the correct response, launched it into the world in the right way at the right time. So I thought that was just really interesting. And Brandon Quittem \u2014 I talked to him about the Fourth Turning. He made the point \u2014 and I haven\u2019t actually read this book yet \u2014 but he made the point that in these long cycles, there\u2019s First, Second, Third, Fourth Turnings, there tends to come a kind of pivotal moment or innovation or something that comes just at the right time to reverse course. And it feels and seems like Bitcoin is definitely becoming that in the modern age! The world is just going in one direction on central banking and we needed some autoimmune response and it appears Bitcoin is that! Then we got into Bitcoin as a store of value. I think he made very strong arguments \u2014 especially when you zoom out to a 100+ year time frame \u2014 that Bitcoin is basically the sole 21st Century store of value. It just is incomparable to anything else. And this 2020 war on currency and escalating government overreach, this has just pushed an awareness of Bitcoin on people and sort of accelerated that autoimmune response in a way. And to just compare it real quick, because we went through alternative stores of value, you have bonds, but they\u2019re not bumping up against the zero-bound, and to Saylor\u2019s point, it\u2019s harder to discern when you\u2019re being taken advantage of when the natural interest rate is 5% and you\u2019re getting 2%, but it\u2019s much easier for market participants to understand that they\u2019re getting screwed when there\u2019s a negative yield. There\u2019s something very special about crossing that zero barrier and that\u2019s where bonds are at today. And they are getting quickly decimated as a viable store of value because there\u2019s no yield. Equities, they\u2019re way overvalued across all fundamentals and valuation metrics \u2014 historic all-time highs, P/E ratios, multiples on EBITDA or enterprise value, etc. And that is\u2014what I would argue as a Bitcoiner \u2014 is a function of: we\u2019ve compromised the store of value function of fiat currency, so that function is now \u2014 the market\u2019s figuring out it needs to assign that function to any other asset! And equities are somewhat reliably scarce at least. But this has a perverse effect in that\u2014as Saylor says \u2014 the price of equities are delaminating from their fundamentals. So they\u2019re overvalued in the marketplace. And they\u2019re actually becoming more and more risky. There\u2019s this perverse effect of: the more we use an equity as a store of value, the less effective it is as a store of value in the long run, which is really strange. And Bitcoin is the opposite of that! Bitcoin is actually becoming more secure as a store of value as its price increases, and therefore more attractive. And this is an economic concept called a Veblen good, which you could look up, but basically there are certain assets that the demand tends to increase as the price increases, which is contrary to most other assets. But I think Bitcoin fits that category. Commodities are another alternative \u2014 we destroyed those in earlier episodes as Saylor checked those out. And finally real estate, which has been a really popular one for the past 50 years especially in the US \u2014 real estate cannot be hidden and it\u2019s being taxed every year. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to tax because you can\u2019t hide it, and that is the dominion on which the government projects its power. So I think there\u2019s really high valuations there, plus there\u2019s no concealability so that sort of compromises real estate as a good store of value. He makes the point that, to be a good store of value, you really want to have a technology that\u2019s focused on that function. Equities, you\u2019re creating all kinds of other value in the economy, granted albeit riskily \u2014 they\u2019re taking on risk and trying new ventures and figuring things out and innovating. Property would be probably be a little more stable but it still has other uses \u2014 there\u2019s actually a utility use there. So the point being: You want the pure store of value. That\u2019s what gold effectively was \u2014 it was the purest store of value we had historically. [1:17:03] And now that\u2019s what Bitcoin is today. And we could say it\u2019s kind of like being a single-celled organism. As Saylor said, You don\u2019t want to be a vertebrate with all these complex features, because the additional features open you up to more risk and attack surface. What you want is something very unidimensional, single-cell, just holds value in a trust-minimized way across time and space. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is! That is the big breakthrough! And that led us into via negativa, which is another Talebian concept that I really like. And in a way this ties back to a quote that Saylor Tweeted once. He said, A designer knows he has achieved perfection when there is nothing left to take away. And as we discussed previously, money has 5 properties: divisibility, durability, recognizability, portability, scarcity. So what did Satoshi do in the creation of Bitcoin? The reason it\u2019s so genius, and the reason Satoshi\u2019s an artist, and the reason Bitcoin is effectively a perfected money is because Satoshi took away all of the indivisibility, all of the decomposability, all of the unrecognizability, all of the immovability, and all of the unpredictability from money! Right? He maximally removed all of these negative aspects of money to deliver us the quasi-perfection that is Bitcoin. And that speaks again to this minimization of attack surface. You\u2019ve reduced all of the features of money to strip it down to its bare bones. Just its bare monetary properties. And you\u2019ve taken away all the negative aspects from those properties, so you\u2019ve effectively perfected those properties. And this speaks again to Bitcoin\u2019s resistance to disruption! We\u2019ve achieved attack surface minimization via monetary property optimization. So this is via negativa! The more you take away, what you have left becomes more valuable, essentially. And another way to say that is: We commonly hear that, Oh, this new crypto-asset can do this or that that Bitcoin can\u2019t do! But the lesser feature set of Bitcoin is a feature itself, not a bug! Because it\u2019s whole value prop is survivability. It cannot be stopped. It is just perfected store of value that adheres to 21 Million and no one can shut down the network. No political or military action can shut down the network. That is the core value prop of Bitcoin. That is what it optimizes for. [1:20:05] And as Saylor puts this \u2014 again in one of his Tweets \u2014 he says, Bitcoin has no country, has no company, has no competitor. So that\u2019s what makes it so special, is that it\u2019s something that actually exists beyond us, which turns out to be really important! And I would add to that too that Bitcoin has no identified creator. We know it\u2019s Satoshi but no one knows who Satoshi is. We don\u2019t have his person to point toward. And the absence of that personality \u2014 the creator \u2014I would say actually gives Bitcoin mythological bedrock, which really underpins its decentralization. If we knew who Satoshi was and he was in the news every day, he was out getting drunk at the bar or something and everyone knew he had a million coins, it would just open him up to a lot of attacks and call a lot of things into question that his disappearance basically nullified. So this godhead of Bitcoin we call Satoshi I think really reinforces the value proposition of survivability and decentralization. And that gets us into what I thought was the most interesting part of the discussion today! And that was when Saylor pointed to the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a contributing factor to the value of the Bitcoin network. And I love the analogy where the defenders of 21 Million effectively \u2014 the network participants themselves \u2014 we are the keepers of the flame. We are the mythological keepers of the flame. The point being there: to preserve an institution adequately over time, you need adherents or fanatics if you will that are so convicted in their belief that they\u2019re willing to flee persecution to preserve the institution. And he drew the analogy to people coming to the US. People came to the US largely to practice religious freedom. People wanted a refuge that they could freely put their spiritual preferences above politics, and the US provided that. Then to bring it forward a bit, we\u2019re seeing the faith shaken in existing institutions worldwide, whether it\u2019s your government, your bank\u2014all these legacy institutions \u2014faith has been severely shaken, especially in the wake of COVID. Saylor made a great point: even at the universities where no one\u2019s going to campus anymore and they\u2019re taking their classes online, you\u2019re reducing the affiliation with a brick and mortar university, and you\u2019re strengthening the affiliation with the digital university. So the institutions and companies and brands that adapt to the digital age more quickly will actually benefit more at the expense of legacy institutions. So that\u2019s a mega-political trend that\u2019s under way. And the flame for Bitcoin, if you will, is kept between the nodes, the miners, and the HODLers, which are basically preserving this dynamic equilibrium centered on 21 Million. And I love this analogy of worshiping at the altar, where people in the past all worshiped at the altar, they would actually feed the flame even by tithing say 10% of their income. So they\u2019re funding this religious institution \u2014 they\u2019re also preaching these values to their contemporaries or their kids, so they\u2019re passing these values forward in time using both money and language, which I thought was very interesting. And ritual \u2014 I would add to that! So in the Bitcoin world we\u2019ve gotten miners energizing the fire. They\u2019re adding additional energy to the network that is its security budget, effectively. You have nodes protecting the fire, which are basically selecting the rule set that the miners are enforcing. And then we have the HODLers themselves which are the fire! They\u2019re the living flame that\u2019s centered around 21 Million, so it\u2019s like this group of people, this social layer, that\u2019s all oriented to preserving 21 Million which benefits everyone and intertwines everyone\u2019s fate. And each one of those is just another element in this composite fault-tolerant structure that we call Bitcoin. So it\u2019s this radically new way to think about it as more of a religious-like institution. And maybe you could even say that nodes, miners, and HODLers are kind of like the Holy Trinity of Bitcoin. Maybe 21 Million is the God or something that they\u2019re oriented around. Might be a stretch, but I thought I\u2019d mention that nonetheless. So Bitcoin as religion \u2014 the question comes naturally: What are its values? And Saylor declares: Truth, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology, Self-Sovereignty \u2014 all of these things are embedded in the value system of true Bitcoiners, and they carry that into the world in their word, in their deed, in their investments. And I just can\u2019t think of a more robust, powerful, effective, well-organized group of people in the world than the Bitcoiners I\u2019ve interacted with! I\u2019ve said it before: There\u2019s nothing in the world that makes me more bullish on Bitcoin than Bitcoiners. And again, if we go back to the purpose of Man or at least what distinguishes him and what makes him superior to the other animals, it\u2019s our ability to channel energy across space and time. And I love Saylor\u2019s point: Energy begets life. So Bitcoin is being this tool for immortalizing the channeling of energy. We can channel it across space and time in any direction we want with essentially no loss. That 21 Million \u2014 or Bitcoin itself \u2014 it\u2019s actually in a way kind of the pursuit of immortal life. We\u2019re pursuing a medium that maximally preserves energy across space and time. So it\u2019s like, Pfft, well of course it\u2019s a religious institution\u2014we\u2019re pursuing immortal life! Not immortal life in the sense that you live forever, but a network or institution that lives forever for the betterment of all, and one in which you can project your own wills and values beyond your own life. The example there was the Saylor Foundation, which is: his value \u2014 Saylor\u2019s own personal value system \u2014 is free education for all. He thinks that is something that\u2019s really important for the human race, and now with Bitcoin he has a way to finance and project those values beyond his own life. He can now do something to fund and strengthen this institution beyond his own life in a way that was not possible before Bitcoin, and you could say that this is a way of him projecting values and willpower and intentions and preferences into his own afterlife, if you will. It doesn\u2019t mean Heaven, but just beyond his own life. And then we touched on another religious aspect of this: it\u2019s that 21 Million is truly transcendent. It is something no one can do anything about. And I think that speaks to its religious qualities in a way as well. He had this great quote, it said: If you worship Science, the Laws of Physics, Thermodynamics, and Mathematical Clarity, then Bitcoin is your religion! I thought that was beautifully said. It points back to us. The strength of Bitcoin as a store of value, as money, is rooted in the faithfulness of its adherents, of its believers, if you will. So it is up to all of us to preserve the principles embodied in those fields of study. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is. We concluded with: Perhaps economics through all of history was just more of a political preference or much more just a social science. Even in Austrian Economics, there\u2019s a very low use of objective measurements because there are no constants in human action, effectively. But it seems like with Bitcoin we do have this collision of computer science and everything underpinning that with the softer social science of economics. So maybe this is the emergence of something really different and unique, like a more objective economic science. These things like Value, Supply & Demand \u2014 supply is the objective side, demand is the subjective side \u2014 these things are still gonna hold the same qualities, but the introduction of absolute scarcity and a money that cannot be monopolized and resists corruption certainly changes the game, right? I don\u2019t know that it will cause us to rewrite the history books per se, but we will move more towards this engineering-like mindset in the field of economics. So yeah! That was it, man! A monster episode. I hope you guys enjoyed that. Episodes 1, 2, 3 built a lot of foundation. I think 4, 5, 6 really started to build some crescendo here, and 7 was a big peak for me personally, especially the later stages of this discussion. I definitely think we\u2019re routing around the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole! I hope you guys enjoyed this and I\u2019ll see you back here soon for the next one!"}

Welcome back to Episode 6 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! So today we\u2019re gonna be talking about how Bitcoin is harder, smarter, faster, and stronger than any form of money in existence! Specifically we\u2019ll be drawing a lot of analogies to gold, which Bitcoin\u2014as we\u2019ve discussed\u2014is disrupting too! And we\u2019re gonna look at this through a number of angles. And a lot of this is building on things we touched on early on in the series like specifically getting into Stone Age technologies and actually how the use of tools and the harnessing of energy is what let\u2019s man be harder, faster, stronger, smarter than any other animal on the planet. So in fact these characteristics define the utility of both innovation and evolution! So the tool that best exhibits them tends to outcompete in the marketplace. So we\u2019re drawing back to some lessons we made earlier. This is Episode 6 and if you haven\u2019t checked out Episodes 1\u20135 yet I suggest that you do, because it all culminates into what we\u2019re getting into now. We\u2019re gonna look at this through a number of angles. One is custody \u2014 how Bitcoin custody is very unique! We\u2019re also gonna get into the specter of quantum computing \u2014 there are a lot of people out there that like to think quantum computing is some kind of big threat to Bitcoin so we\u2019ll dismantle that one. We\u2019re also gonna get into the hardware and software updates of a technology like Bitcoin versus gold and fiat. We\u2019re also gonna look at the programmable aspects of Bitcoin and how that makes it unique! We\u2019re also gonna look at the defensibility of Bitcoin and how it\u2019s one of the most defensible assets \u2014 if not the most defensible assets \u2014 in the history of mankind! And then we\u2019re also gonna look at how \u2014 as monetary energy, Saylor likes to call it \u2014 Bitcoin let\u2019s us place capital more quickly and more intelligently than any other money before in terms of generating yield. So we\u2019ll get into some discussion on that as well. And then finally we\u2019ll get into Bitcoin as being the first truly digital native money \u2014 it is pure information! It\u2019s massless, it can be moved at the speed of light! And this enables a plethora of high frequency and micro transactions that were simply not possible with any other monetary technology historically! Finally we\u2019ll look at how all these elements are combined to give Bitcoin users and HODLers more optionality than any other money in history. And at the end of the day that\u2019s what money is \u2014 it\u2019s the instrument for freedom. So with that, I\u2019m exciting to dive into this one! We\u2019re digging deeper into Bitcoin theory. And yeah \u2014 with that, let\u2019s get into it!"}

So Bitcoin is digital gold. And if we use that metaphor some people look at it in a very constrained sense and some people look at it more broadly, but when I say Bitcoin is digital gold, it\u2019s harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than traditional gold! There\u2019s a lot of depth behind it, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s fully appreciated. Let\u2019s just start with harder: We talked a bit about how Bitcoin is harder because of its 21 Million cap, and its stock to flow is exponentially going to infinity. And that\u2019s the easy part of harder because you\u2019re exactly comparing it to gold! And if gold has a stock to flow of 50 and Bitcoin has a stock to flow of infinity then it\u2019s harder! But, there\u2019s another element of harder that we don\u2019t talk about much, and it\u2019s really Nicholas Taleb\u2019s Antifragile harder! Bitcoin is an antifragile element. I\u2019ve used the metaphor cyber hornets but I think people think it\u2019s a cute metaphor but I\u2019m not really thinking it\u2019s a cute metaphor! What I\u2019m meaning is, it\u2019s literally a swarm of cyber hornets that keep getting more powerful that you can\u2019t kill that are going to get harder and stronger and faster and they\u2019re going to eat you if you try to stop them \u2014 and that\u2019s really hard! People don\u2019t think about it like that! But I\u2019ll give you an example, or another metaphor from history: The Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a defense, and it\u2019s a material defense \u2014 it\u2019s like a bunch of stones stacked up and it\u2019s very expensive to create it, and it was meant to keep the Mongols out! And it\u2019s a fragile defense, because it\u2019s literally a static stone structure and it didn\u2019t keep the Mongols out. Eventually they found a weak point in one of the gates, cracked through, and then they slaughtered all the Chinese, defeated the empire \u2014 took over! Now how is that similar to what Alexander the Great\u2019s father said \u2014 Philip II of Macedon \u2014 he\u2019s attributed this quote: No citadel is impenetrable as long as it has a road wide enough for me to fit a donkey up it with a pot of gold on its back!"}

The third example we have in modern history is the Maginot Line, where the French built this impenetrable defense against the Germans and the Germans simply went around it through Belgium \u2014 by cheating! They hacked it! They just ducked it! And if you think about the lessons of military history, one of the lessons is: The best defense is a good offense. And another way to look at it is that if you want a good defense, you need an active defense \u2014 a moving defense! You\u2019re a boxer in a ring and someone wants to hit you \u2014 your best defense is that you move quicker than them and you hit faster and harder than them while they\u2019re getting ready to hit you \u2014 and so they can\u2019t!"}

Continuous adaptation, absorption of your enemy\u2019s capabilities and reaction and you play them back at them! And so when we think about gold \u2014 I\u2019ve affectionately deemed gold the dumb rock \u2014 it\u2019s a rock! It\u2019s not intelligent! It\u2019s not a life force! A coral reef is a life form! All forms of life \u2014 they\u2019re living! They\u2019re adaptive! If you kill the weak element, the ones you didn\u2019t kill get stronger! With regard to Bitcoin, it\u2019s composed of a number of elements: there\u2019s software \u2014 the software is running on hardware. The hardware is running in facilities that are plugged into the firmament of some domain. There are people that are running that software, that are operating those facilities, that are building that hardware. And those people are also acting in the political domain and the economic domain, right? There are people in the Bitcoin ecosystem that are improving the Square wallet, they\u2019re improving the Binance exchange. So they\u2019re improving the back end server exchanges, they\u2019re improving the front end client software, they\u2019re improving the hardware wallets, they\u2019re improving the Bitcoin Core software, they\u2019re improving the ASICs that the miners are running, there are people negotiating with governments everywhere on Earth to get better electricity, there are people that are negotiating with politicians to get better regulatory treatment, there are people that are marketing Bitcoin and there are educators \u2014 yourself, on YouTube! There are people on Twitter, there are communicators, there are analysts that are creating analytical functions that are being used to drive and channel the network. They\u2019re all moving! They\u2019re all evolving! They are strong exchanges getting stronger! There are weak exchanges getting weaker, right? We see that all around us! There are countries where Bitcoin mining is flourishing, there are countries where Bitcoin mining is under attack. Gold is a dumb rock \u2014 it is sitting on the floor. Gold is not going to move itself! Gold is not going to feel pain! It\u2019s not gonna feel pity, it\u2019s not gonna feel inspiration \u2014 it\u2019s just going to lie there and wait. And Bitcoin is a different thing! So the antifragility of Bitcoin comes from the fact that everybody in the ecosystem feels the same pain in the same way. If Bitcoin\u2019s price goes down, every Bitcoin HODLer feels it! If Bitcoin is hacked and goes to zero, every Bitcoiner loses their life\u2019s energy! We are a hive creature all integrated with one another\u2014and when there is that pain it spreads very quickly through the entire ecosystem! The information flows rapidly! So if we consider threats to Bitcoin \u2014 a lot of people, they always whine \u2014 I hear this whine, Well what about the quantum computer? What about the quantum computer? And I wanna say, Yeah! And what if an asteroid hits the Earth and kills us all? Or, what about a pocket thermonuclear pencil that blows up the entire universe and what if your enemy gets it before you did? I mean there\u2019s a lot of silly notions of that \u2014 What if somebody had the impossibly powerful weapon and they\u2019re evil and they decide to use it on you? You could look at it that way, but I think a more constructive way to look at it is: If someone comes up with a computer that runs twice as fast as the current computers! The most profitable use of the computer is Bitcoin mining! If someone comes up with something which mines, that generates SHA-256 crypto hashes faster than the current generation of Bitcoin mining equipment, the most lucrative thing you can do with it is plug it into the network and start to contribute more hash rate! And so, who do you think is gonna notice first when that thing happens? If someone comes up with a better \u2014 Well what happens when it gets so powerful that it can break SHA-256? Well, dudes, we\u2019re just gonna go to SHA-512! Or we\u2019re gonna go to the next thing \u2014 1024! And anybody that ever studied computer science knows: We start with 16, go to 32, go to 64, go to 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on and so forth \u2014 and the numbers get pretty fricking big! And then when they get done with that they flip to the next protocol, the next protocol! [16:16] Who do you think is gonna figure that out? The people that have $500 Billion of risk to figure it out? Or someone that\u2019s got no money at all but thinks they might just want to solve the problem just so they can crack the world? And it\u2019s like, Yeah, maybe! But it\u2019s just as likely that some dude\u2019s gonna come up with a revolver that shoots like photon bullets and they\u2019re going to crash the United States government because they\u2019re the first dude with a photon bullet revolver. It\u2019s an interesting idea \u2014 I\u2019m a lot more persuaded if the Pentagon with their hundreds of billions of dollars is gonna come up with a photon bullet gun or the laser rifle or the whatever. So the entire network is channeling innovation. You come up with better hardware? It\u2019s gonna go into the miners. You come up with better client software? It\u2019s gonna go into the wallets. You come up with a better software, or a way to write software? Don\u2019t you think people in the Bitcoin Core community are gonna use that way to write better software? And if it\u2019s too dangerous, the community is gonna slow it down \u2014 otherwise, if there\u2019s a political threat, everybody that\u2019s adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset has a vested interest in dealing with the political threat. And if they can\u2019t deal with it \u2014 if you are a creature with two arms and I wrap a tourniquet around one of your arms and I choke off the blood flow, the arm dies \u2014 use the other arm! When you\u2019re an octopus, you\u2019ve got eight. When you\u2019re a hydra, you\u2019ve got a million. So the entire creature\u2019s just going to move to a place where there is oxygen where it can live. And if it can fight, it will fight. And if it can\u2019t fight, it will morph itself into a different domain, and unless you figure out a way to kill it everywhere at the same time \u2014 utterly, down to the last node \u2014 you\u2019re probably not gonna kill it. And it seems to me that nobody\u2019s really got a vested interest in doing that and if they did it\u2019s just not clear. Pick one government \u2014 one government attacks it, it becomes more useful to every other government. And they all can\u2019t agree on anything, ever. And even if they could agree on anything, ever, they still can\u2019t do it, right?"}

I love the quote from Philip II of Macedon about the road being wide enough for a donkey with a pot of gold. That relates to me to the famous quote from Charlie Munger: Show me the incentive and I\u2019ll show you the outcome. And I think that is one of the key aspects of Bitcoin is that, even if you have this breakthrough \u2014 quantum computer, whatever it is \u2014 you\u2019re still incentivized to contribute that innovation to the network. That is the most lucrative, most energy-efficient strategy possible, even in that breakthrough environment. And to your point about cryptography \u2014 it\u2019s always been a cat and mouse game. It\u2019s always been kind of the defense, someone trying to crack it, and then the defense adapts. To your point it\u2019s a dynamic defense, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s ongoing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so relevant.

So gatekeeper is a very powerful metaphor: The reason that the Great Wall of China fell was because there were gates and there were gatekeepers. And the prosperity of 100 Million people could be destroyed by corrupting the one on the gate. As soon as the one gatekeeper opens the gate, the 100,000 person army comes through. And herein you see the problem with hiding behind a wall, or hiding behind a wall with a gate in it. A much better idea would be: I have my own 100,000 person army and when that army comes I stand against them. And that\u2019s what the Romans knew. The Romans never sat and cowered behind a gate, they knew \u2014 and anybody in a war knows \u2014 you have to go and leave the citadel and you have to actively fight the army that would kill you, because if they manage to surround you and isolate you, no amount of defense is going to hold [them] back. They will find a way through, and that\u2019s the story of history. Gatekeepers are your weakness! There\u2019s no gatekeepers in Bitcoin, and there\u2019s no gatekeepers in a decentralized proof of work network that\u2019s energy-intensive. That\u2019s one of the problems I think of like proof of stake networks or the \u2014 every time someone tries to come up with a \u201cmore efficient way to do it\u201d, well if you\u2019re going to secure a $1 Trillion network with $1 Billion of stuff staked, the problem with that is all I need is another $1 Billion to bribe that person. Or half a billion! Half a billion bribes half that network and then I topple the entire trillion and I get it all, right? So when you have anything where I\u2019m playing games where I\u2019m trying to use a small amount of energy \u2014 and money is energy, right? \u2014 a small amount of money, a small amount of energy. If you\u2019re trying to use a small amount of energy to secure a large amount of energy, you created a gatekeeper! And so you need to flip the pyramid, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s no shortcuts here: There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. And it doesn\u2019t terribly bother me that Bitcoin channels a lot of energy. By the way \u2014 through encryption facilities! A miner is an encryption facility, it\u2019s generating SHA-256 hashes and you\u2019re gonna have to get through that hash wall, and the only way you\u2019re gonna get through it is you\u2019re gonna have to buy yourself 51% of all of that equipment on Earth, and then you\u2019re gonna have to harness 51% of all the energy, and then you\u2019re gonna have to attack and it still may not work!"}

When the thing\u2019s worth $10 Trillion and the transaction fees are 1%, there\u2019s gonna be $100 Billion worth a year worth of transaction fees, so it\u2019s $51 Billion a year. If you cap that at 20x, it\u2019s $1 Trillion just to go along with the program! So someone\u2019s gonna have to have $100 Trillion and be really mad in order to want to spend $1 Trillion to destroy other people \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, you\u2019re not gonna get to attack the thing without a counterattack, right? Because at the point that you have 100 Million people that all have all of their life\u2019s energy \u2014 all of their hopes, their aspirations and all of their economic security and physical security invested in the network \u2014 they\u2019re probably not gonna roll over and let you do it. It\u2019s pretty hard for one evil genius by themself to plot a trillion-dollar war on a cyber network. How are you gonna gather the software and the hardware and the monetary energy and the political support by yourself? And if you\u2019re not by yourself, I\u2019m reminded of the phrase, Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. [24:56] So when I think about Bitcoin I think, It\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s harder because it\u2019s an evolving herd creature, an evolving swarm creature. And it\u2019s evolving as fast as it can, and it feels pain. As Nicholas Taleb says in Antifragile, Pain is a good thing! You can tell the difference between people that get it and people that don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s a group of people in life that run from pain, and they\u2019re attempting to anesthesize themselves and always isolate themselves from pain. And there\u2019s a group of people that run toward pain, or at least they embrace pain. Pain\u2019s a good thing! The more pain you feel, the faster your reflexes. Put your hand on a hot stove, it moves quickly \u2014 you have reflexes. So that system is learning and pain is one of our number one information signals \u2014 maybe the most important information signal, in order to provide a living organism with vitality."}

Yeah Taleb says that, Stressors and pain are indistinguishable from information at the organic level. That it\u2019s the only way that an organic system learns is by exposure to something that is resistive or conflictive to it. And even at a genetic level, when a virus invades a host organism and destroys its cells, there\u2019s always a few cells that survive. And those cells that survive actually take some of the DNA from the virus that wiped out 99% of their cellular comrades and incorporates that DNA into its own such that it is resistant now to that virus. So it\u2019s happening at an informational level even deep in biology. This isn\u2019t just something that happens kind of at the physical layer here. It happens really \u2014 it\u2019s quintessential to life, is I guess the point I\u2019m getting at."}

And I think that if it\u2019s not a living thing, it can\u2019t be hard, it can\u2019t be hardest! People think gold is the hardest thing because it\u2019s a rock, but it really isn\u2019t the hardest thing. The hardest thing is like the Mongolian horde if you\u2019re in its way. When the horde with 100,000 comes at you and they\u2019re terrorizing, blood-curdling with their missiles \u2014 and if you read the history of Genghis Khan, they would ride across the plain, they\u2019d find a city, the city is surrounded by a moat, they would go upriver and divert the river, they would divert the river, choke the city, starve them of water for three days, and they\u2019d ride underneath the gates in the riverbed. It\u2019s just horrifying, blood-curdling, living horde creature. And you want to attack it? It\u2019s moving. You could go to it, retreat, they stop, they turn around, they throw you off balance, they murder you. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re dealing with living creatures. Go into a hornets nest, attack the hornets with your revolver \u2014 see what happens. The most horrifying thing, right? You have 1,000 hornets \u2014 you see these videos of 20 hornets taking apart 20,000 bees?"}

Those are gatekeepers and political financial systems and gatekeepers on the wall of China on a wall are literally gatekeepers. And the result is: one person has the power to destroy the lives of a million by opening the gate. Because Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a gate there\u2019s no gatekeeper, therefore there\u2019s no asymmetric payoff. It\u2019s not economically feasible to break through. Now another big advantage in the antifragility of Bitcoin is this idea that I can run my own node, I can take my own keys off the network, I can choose to trust them with a custodian, or I can choose to take ownership of them myself, and I can choose for example to put a million dollars with a custodian that\u2019s going to run a bank or maybe lend it out or give me yield on it or protect it. But then at the point that I lose confidence in them, I can shift all those assets to another trustee, or I can take physical possession of them myself, and because you have lots of different entities \u2014 individuals and corporations \u2014 choosing to do different things at all times, even though someone might entrust their keys to a bank, the security of the entire system is being protected by the someone that doesn\u2019t! So the diversity with which people choose to engage and support the network actually makes it more antifragile. And the potential\u2014for example: if I know that you are gonna take possession of your keys, and then if you set up an organization that\u2019s custodians that will hold my keys and charge me 10 basis points, then if another organization charges me 50 basis points, I would just say to them, I\u2019m gonna shift to the 10 basis points. The competition drives their rate down or I move to 10 basis points. If I hear that your exchange or your custodian is not secure or it might not be secure, or if I heard that there\u2019s a new multisig protocol that more secure and I ask you and you don\u2019t support, I move my keys or I move my assets to the next wallet, the next technique. That means that you cannot afford to ignore me because you don\u2019t have a monopoly, right? There\u2019s no regulator saying I have to leave my keys with the Breedlove Trust in order to get a tax deduction, or in order to qualify for a 501c3, 413, 509, etc. IRA, this or that. As you start to have pure competition, you get this ferocious evolution in all aspects of the ecosystem. And we saw it with miners for example: they started with CPUs, and they flipped to GPUs, and then they went to ASICs. And like every 3 years there\u2019s another generation. The thing that really destroys the quantum computing argument is, if anything, Bitcoin has proven that people that believe in the Bitcoin network are going to pursue the highest performance special-purpose client and server hardware before everybody else in the world! If you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin wallets, they\u2019re more secure than any other mobile client device. And if you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin ASIC miners, they\u2019re higher performance than AWS or any device you\u2019ll find on a public cloud. And that\u2019s because Bitcoiners have skin in the game. Back to one of Nicholas Taleb\u2019s books, it\u2019s like everybody that writes the software, runs the software, uses the software \u2014 everybody has skin in the game. If you go to business it\u2019s gonna be obliterated if you fall behind. As a miner you can\u2019t make any money. As a wallet you can\u2019t sell anything. As a crypto bank exchange \u2014 look how fast the money moves out of one exchange to another this week. Everybody has skin in the game, nobody can ignore the pain, agency bias is very hard to come by, and you can expect every year forever, it\u2019s gonna get harder! Now back to this issue of Apple and Amazon: Apple\u2019s the most valuable company on Earth because they can ship a software update to a billion people for a nickel. That\u2019s pretty powerful! Well with Bitcoin, you can rewrite the software that runs the nodes to make it smarter, right? You can rewrite the software or the firmware that works on the mining devices. And so the hardware cycle \u2014 what\u2019s the upgrade cycle on hardware\u20142 years maybe? 1, 2, 3 years? In that range. What\u2019s the upgrade cycle on software? Well it depends on whether it\u2019s the node or the client software \u2014 1, 2, 3, years. In the greater scheme of things, it doesn\u2019t have to be super fast, you just have to compare it to the number of hardware and software upgrade cycles on gold."}

In 5 Billion years! Gold\u2019s pretty much 5 Billion years \u2014 God made it, and left it that way. And there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from that, but the point is: it\u2019s not upgrading, it\u2019s not going to move. And if it doesn\u2019t move, invariably when human beings come in conflict with mountains, we move the mountains! We move the rivers, we chop up the granite. Go look at a citadel, it\u2019s literally moved the mountain. You might have to move it 2 tons at a time. Look at the pyramids. 5,000 years ago someone figured out how to move a mountain of rock. And that\u2019s 5,000\u20144,000 years ago! Are you gonna bet against 100,000 humans with their channeling gravity, channeling water, channeling whatever? Or are you gonna bet on the mountain? And the answer is: you\u2019re gonna bet on the human beings! When you roll forward and you look at human beings versus animals, it\u2019s the same thing: us versus elephants, us versus lions, us versus nature \u2014 anything living. Generally we figure out how to beat it because we channel energy better! So now we\u2019re talking about, What are we competing with here? Well, if we\u2019re competing with gold it just seems like no contest whatsoever! Let\u2019s talk about smarter, stronger, and faster. Because harder is relevant to money, but smarter, stronger, and faster is the source of all tech value in the past 20 years \u2014 maybe in the past 2,000 years. Let\u2019s talk about smarter. Well if Bitcoin is programmable money \u2014 it\u2019s a pure energy token and I can move it around \u2014 that means that I can write software on the clients and I can software on the server that will actually move the money. And that means you can hold keys to 100 Bitcoin and then you can write software that will prove that you\u2019re credit-worthy, that you own the keys to 100 Bitcoin. Then you can actually use it to register and certify a transaction or information or a title channeled into that. I can write a piece of software that will \u2014 what do I want? What if a million people wanted to borrow money pledging Bitcoin? And what if another million people wanted to loan out money and generate interest? And what if I write a program where everybody on one side says, I\u2019ll pay 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8% interest, and everybody on the other side says, I\u2019ll make a loan assuming a collateral coverage of 4:1 in Bitcoin and I can mark it to market every hour. Okay? You\u2019re offering me terms, you\u2019re offering the loan, I\u2019m offering to borrow, we create a piece of software, it runs every day, every minute, every second. Robert, what if you had 10 Bitcoin and I scanned everybody \u2014 100 Million people \u2014 what if I scanned them today and I found someone willing to pay you 8% interest with a loan to value of 10% and you could mark it to market every minute? Good deal? Maybe! Maybe a good deal! Maybe you wouldn\u2019t be willing to loan it, but if you did \u2014 what if I went through all 100 Million of \u2019em and I found someone that needed the money real bad and would pay you 27% interest? Smart. Smart? What if I actually ran the algorithm every hour? What if I ran the algorithm every second? What if someone wants to borrow the money for a year and they\u2019ll pay you 10%? And what if they want to borrow for 30 years and they\u2019ll pay you 15%? What if they want to borrow for 1 year and they\u2019ll pay you 5%? What if they want to pay you overnight and they\u2019ll pay you x%? You could generate the yield curve with a piece of software, and then that software will connect all of the lenders with all of the borrowers on a server. It could be a centralized server. The logic doesn\u2019t have to be decentralized. In fact a centralized server runs a billion times faster than a proof of work network, so it\u2019s likely that the logic will be smart, and that\u2019s an idea. Another idea is: put the intelligence on your iPhone and be able to talk to your iPhone and when I talk to my iPhone I can tell it to chop my money into 37 pieces and send it off \u2014 Send my money to my daughter and let her spend it on ice cream but not on Uber rides because I don\u2019t want her running off with her boyfriend somewhere. So I can condition the money using all manner of software, and I can turn on servers that will move my money around while I\u2019m sleeping, and I can turn on clients that will handle my money. And of course, if I walked into your bedroom and I picked up a gold bar and I walked out with it, the bar\u2019s not gonna complain \u2014 it\u2019s a dumb rock! On the other hand, if I took your Bitcoin and I wrapped your multi-factor authentication around it and your retina scan and your voice scan, I could geofence it and I could say, Nobody can move a mobile device with this Bitcoin key outside 100 meters of where Robert lives. You could do all sorts of magical crazy things with software that you can\u2019t do in mechanics \u2014 machines. So gold is in essence mechanical, and Bitcoin is virtual. And of course, it\u2019s tokenized, and that means it can get as smart as the computer can get smart, and eventually the computers can talk to other computers and that opens up all sorts of applications like credit ratings, authenticity, insurance. Maybe I want to buy insurance for you but I want you to pledge the full value of my house and I want to know that you have the proof of the reserves to pay off the insurance, right? So you can create very interesting pieces of software with less risk or more transparency and more speed. We know it doesn\u2019t work with gold. It doesn\u2019t work with tokenized gold, because you\u2019ve got the counterparty risk and you don\u2019t know whether the tokens actually are backed by real gold. It doesn\u2019t really work with other tokenized assets because stocks, bonds\u2014they move too slow \u2014 and there\u2019s no API between the bonds and the tokens and if there was an API you end up with regulatory compliance issues and you\u2019re not delivering the physical instrument, ever. So that\u2019s just not likely to happen."}

It\u2019s not adapting, it\u2019s not changing. I wonder if \u2014 so today, to kind of change the lanes a little bit, the US Treasury is considered the risk-free rate in the world, being that it bears low to no interest, but it [presumably] has no risk of default, or the lowest risk of default. As you see us moving into more of a Bitcoin-denominated world, there have been talks of a risk-free rate for Bitcoin developing on the Lightning Network, such that you would fund these Lightning channels in time-locked contracts that the market would determine \u2014 anywhere from a minute to 30 years \u2014 and it would bear some interest rate. Do you think that\u2019s the direction the risk-free rate goes? Is that how we develop a Bitcoin yield curve? Or how do you see that evolving?"}

I think on a chain like Lightning above the base chain \u2014 by the way you could do it with a centralized or a decentralized solution, right? So Lightning is one solution, but you could do it on any exchange too if they chose to do it. There\u2019s a lot of ways to solve the problem. The key idea is to create a free market yield curve. Rational people of their own volition would never willingly loan you for 30 years for 1.4% interest. There is no person that would think that\u2019s a good idea to do it. In a free market you would expect that you would see \u2014 30-year rates would definitely be north of 10-year rates and north of 1-year rates \u2014 you would see things like 3, 4% short term, 5, 6% 10-year, 8% long term risk-free rates. And that\u2019s what they used to be! When Volcker finished his work and he kind of like reset everything, for a while \u2014 the conventional wisdom back in the 80\u2019s was the long term risk-free rate was about 7\u20138% and then the risk premium was 4% and so the cost of capital was about 12% on making an investment. And that\u2019s how they came at it. And the interest rates typically mirrored that \u2014 you could get a savings account for 4\u20135% \u2014 anywhere from 4\u20138% on the yield curve. It\u2019s only state intervention that will deflect it below that. We could talk about that when we get to interest, but that\u2019s my thinking on that. With regard to Bitcoin as an asset, we talked about why it\u2019s harder and why it\u2019s smarter \u2014 because you can program it \u2014 but it\u2019s also stronger. And the stronger is an important thing. Strong is about channeling energy with force and acceleration. I walk into the ring\u2014we\u2019re gonna fight. If I punch slowly, I could be strong. But if I\u2019m slow I don\u2019t win! The fighters that win have explosive force. You could be stronger than me but I can strike you before you strike me I can knock you out. And so it\u2019s all about how explosively you can channel that energy. And that\u2019s what an arrow is, or a sling, or a bullet. It\u2019s not the guy that\u2019s the biggest, strongest, fastest, that wins \u2014 it\u2019s the guy that puts a bullet in your head first that wins. And so we know that in military combat. If we think about stronger in the context of money, it\u2019s all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration. So that means on a Saturday afternoon from a standing start, if you have $10 Million, can you figure out where to put the $10 Million to generate the most yield? Like, I need software! If I had $10 Million in gold, I can\u2019t do anything with it on a Saturday afternoon. On the other hand, if I have $10 Million of Bitcoin and I wrap it with a server, and if the server scans through 1,000 institutional counterparties and then I finance the bid, then I could chop my $10 Million of Bitcoin into 10 pieces. I could send $1 Million to Tokyo, $1 Million to Beijing, Berlin, London. I could leave some of it outstanding for a 1-week loan, some for a 1-month loan, some for a 1-year loan. If their circumstances change \u2014 if you\u2019re pledging some other kind of collateral and I\u2019m marking it to market and it changes, I could snatch back my assets. And so the ability to channel the energy and move it where I need to move it intelligently, fast \u2014 what if I make you a loan of $1 Million at 12% interest on Saturday, and then you come back to me 4 minutes later and you want another million and you\u2019ll pay me 12% more? And what if I like your credit? In the virtual world, in the Bitcoin world, I can just send another million! What if you come back and say, Okay I\u2019ll take $10 Million and give you 14% \u2014 I just need it for 3 days? 3 hours? That\u2019s [fast], right? You can\u2019t do that with gold, ever! And if I had a bond or Apple stock or something like that on a Saturday, it\u2019s not moving! But realistically\u2014I\u2019m giving you an extreme example because it\u2019s kind of magical that your computer server is making you money by scanning the networks on a Saturday afternoon\u2014well I don\u2019t have to be that extreme. For example, if you have $100 Million of Apple stock sitting with the wire house, a big bank \u2014 pick up the phone and tell them you found someone that\u2019s willing to give you 3% interest on the Apple stock \u2014 they would laugh at you! Ha ha ha, ha ha ha!\u2014Well we don\u2019t give interest on that! Well could you just like loan it out to this other party that\u2019s willing to give me \u2014 ha ha ha, no. When\u2019s the last time you got interest on your stock assets from the bank or the trustee that\u2019s holding the stock? Never! They don\u2019t do it! Okay so let\u2019s go through the thought experiment: You have $100 Million in cash, you put it in a savings account back in 1988 that gives you 5% interest. You have $100 Million and you put it into Apple stock and they give you a dividend. Okay good. Now the bank loans your Apple stock to someone that\u2019s gonna short the Apple stock, they short it, they sell it for $100 Million, they take their cash, they put it into something yielding 5% interest, they keep the 5% \u2014 what you get? Nothing! Your Apple stock got hypothecated, you didn\u2019t get paid, and yet if you had $100 Million in a market basket of stocks, why shouldn\u2019t you get a yield on it? The reason you don\u2019t get a yield on it is because conventional financial industry doesn\u2019t have an incentive to do it nor a need to do it, they just [have the power? 52:03] and you don\u2019t! And what causes people to do that is competition. Sometimes by the way [the reason you don\u2019t see] competition across regulatory domain is because if I can get all the regulators in my country to agree that we won\u2019t do this then it\u2019s collusion and regulatory capture. And so when you have a cross-domain asset, it\u2019s less likely you\u2019d have regulatory capture. Ultimately, the strength of Bitcoin comes from the fact that an individual can self-custody and so if the individual can custody and they can do it in any of 200 different regulatory jurisdictions, they can find a jurisdiction where they will have the strongest money where they can generate the most yield and they can move to that jurisdiction. Whereas you\u2019re not gonna be able to convince that mega [inaudible 52:58] bank to move to that jurisdiction and give you the most favorable terms, because they have no interest in that. So that\u2019s what stronger is all about. And then faster comes back to the idea that we\u2019ve dematerialized the gold, and because we\u2019ve dematerialized the gold there\u2019s no mass. And if E=MC\u00b2 and the M goes to zero, then we get the C\u00b2 with very little E! Well at least get the C. We can actually get to the speed of light because we have no mass, and when we think about $100 Million of gold, back to my 3,000 lb metaphor, that\u2019s $250,000 every time you go around the Earth \u2014 so what if I want to send it around the Earth every week? Every day? Every hour?"}

And so faster means that I can send it at the speed of light, and if I can send it at the speed of light, then there\u2019s all sorts of high-frequency transactions and microtransactions that make sense now that never made sense before. How about a world where one rich person makes loans to 10,000 middle class people every week? That\u2019s inconceivable with gold. That\u2019s not possible with stocks or bonds. Because sometimes it\u2019s regulatory compliance issues, or it might be systems issues, right? But it is possible to imagine with Bitcoin \u2014 someone will just create the eBay of social finance. What about one rich person that wants to lend money to 10 institutions? What about 10 institutions that want to work with each other? Ultimately, the things that make something slow, it might be physical mass like the weight of gold that makes it slow, it might be impedance, and the impedance might be a systems impedance. Like it\u2019s Friday afternoon and I cannot move money between 4pm on Friday and 9:30am on Monday. That\u2019s a systems impedance \u2014 it\u2019s not a law, it\u2019s just a custom. And if it\u2019s on Thanksgiving or Christmas well then that doesn\u2019t count either. And then there\u2019s compliance: there is a law. There might be a regulation in a city, a state, or a country, that keeps the energy from moving. There might be a system that keeps the energy from moving. Or there just might be laws of conservation of mass that keeps the energy from moving. And so by moving out of that domain into the cyber domain, you get speed, which is somewhere in the order of 1,000 to 1 Billion times faster! You put all those together: something that\u2019s just continually getting \u2014 and by the way, it\u2019s getting smarter every year, right? We\u2019ve all seen on Google the computers beat humans on chess playing. The computers are all beating us all on everything. The algorithms just keep getting smarter. Wouldn\u2019t you like an algorithm that figured out how to make you money while you\u2019re sleeping? Because I would! Programmed trading, right? The manifestation is programmed trading right now! And the issue is: consumers don\u2019t have the power of programmed trading algorithms to protect their financial interest when their financial, their monetary energy is denominated in traditional assets because they can\u2019t plug their assets into that new system."}

So that was Episode 6 of Michael Saylor here in the Saylor Series. And wow. What can I say? We\u2019re just addressing Bitcoin from every side and putting it in the context of technological development on the whole \u2014 as an essential\u2014as all technologies develop, essentially we\u2019re really putting Bitcoin in that context. Again if you haven\u2019t seen the earlier episodes please go check them out because a lot of this hearkens back to that and I mean I hope you\u2019re enjoying it, I just think it\u2019s getting so good. So as Saylor goes into, Bitcoin is a better tool because it\u2019s harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than gold. And gold historically is the best monetary technology the world has ever had. And we go into this a number of ways. The one very obvious instance that\u2019s most often discussed in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is the hardest money that has ever been. Meaning that it has the highest stock to flow ratio, or said differently the lowest inflation rate \u2014 that one\u2019s obvious. We\u2019ve touched on that one a lot. But another way to look at it is that Bitcoin is also the hardest money that\u2019s ever existed because it\u2019s the most adaptive to entropy. It\u2019s the most antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had, if not the only antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had. And Saylor gives a great example when he talks about a fragile versus an antifragile defense with the Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a static defense, it had a single point of failure, and despite all the effort that went into building and securing that perimeter, the Mongols were able compromise one of the gates, and that\u2019s all it took! The rest of the wall didn\u2019t matter so long as you could compromise a single point. And I think this is very interesting because it\u2019s pointing to the fact that gatekeepers and gates are weaknesses. They are single points of failure in a standard, static defense like that. And I really liked the quote \u2014 I forgot who said it, Philip II of Macedonia perhaps \u2014 but he said that, No citadel is impenetrable if I can fit a donkey with a pot of gold up a road leading to it. Meaning that the defense itself doesn\u2019t necessarily matter if there is a gate or a gatekeeper because you can bribe the gatekeeper! And this is another way that Bitcoin\u2019s outcompeting the legacy system because the legacy system is built on gatekeepers! That\u2019s what central banks are, that\u2019s what governments are \u2014 they\u2019re all just gatekeepers for these flows of economic vitality or monetary energy. And they\u2019re all siphoning it in a tax or a transaction fee with every movement. But Bitcoin as we know doesn\u2019t have any gatekeepers, and in fact Bitcoiners are actively engaging with gatekeepers in the legacy system every day to negotiate better deals with regulators, energy producers, users, businesses in the space, etc. So I think this is a really important point, that gatekeepers are a weakness, and Bitcoin suffers no gatekeepers! That is a breakthrough that it is the first fully disintermediated money. We can just transact peer-to-peer. So that may sound kind of like a nerdy abstraction but it\u2019s really fundamentally important in terms of defending the monetary energy. The other point too going to the antifragility aspect is that the best defense is an adaptive defense, one that responds to the nature of the threat and the character of the aggressor in ways that adapt and respond to changes of circumstances. And I think this is very interesting with Bitcoin because the more the market cap grows, the more monetary energy is stored on its network, the more incentivized all network participants are to defend it, to defend the 21 Million hard cap for instance, or to defend fungibility or privacy at higher layers and to figure things out on behalf of Bitcoin. Everyone\u2019s fate in Bitcoin is intertwined and everyone\u2019s pointed in the same direction. And I think this is heavily discounted in the price in my opinion! Bitcoiners are by nature very adversarial thinkers, but what we don\u2019t often consider in the network design is\u2014we look at worst-case scenarios all the time \u2014 but we fail to account for how highly motivated Bitcoiners actually are to defend the network and to defend the ecosystem. And I would argue even in the market price of Bitcoin this is highly discounted. Bitcoin on balance is relatively highly discounted because it\u2019s just so misunderstood. But I would say even those that understand Bitcoin fail to account for this properly. Again, all of these highly motivated network participants all engaging with other market participants in the broader market, making better deals, and feeding capital into Bitcoin \u2014 in that way everyone ends up on Bitcoin\u2019s payroll in a way \u2014 once you become a HODLer you have these huge incentives to defend the network, to evangelize, to educate, to build businesses in this space. So it\u2019s just a radical vortex of incentives that bootstraps and protects itself. And that\u2019s why so many people call Bitcoin a living thing. And to Saylor\u2019s point, to be truly hard and antifragile, the system needs to be alive. It needs to be adaptive, it needs to respond spontaneously to changes in the environment. And for an antifragile organism, by definition, when you kill any part of the antifragile organism \u2014 even if you kill 99% of it \u2014 and you don\u2019t destroy all of it, then whatever pain inflicted on that animal, it\u2019s going to generate a response to that and it\u2019s going to come back stronger. So that\u2019s what antifragility is, it\u2019s the ability to become hardened through hostility. We see this in most organisms but Brandon Quittem has written about this a lot comparing Mycelium to Bitcoin in that it\u2019s this decentralized network archetype. It\u2019s learning at the edges by having conflicts with different adversarial characters and yet incorporating those learnings into the whole of the organism. And Bitcoin is very similar. So in the sphere of money Bitcoin is the first and only antifragile money we\u2019ve ever had. And if you haven\u2019t read Taleb\u2019s book by that title, Antifragile, one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve read it twice. It\u2019s really hard to stop something that\u2019s antifragile. Antifragile things or organisms or organizations or tools, they dominate the world. They live in a universe pervaded by entropy. Uncertainty is always unfolding in real time. The things that can adapt best to that uncertainty and learn from it the most quickly become dominant. That\u2019s just a principle of the universe. So that\u2019s a lot to chew on and a lot to get your head around, but when you come to see Bitcoin in that light I think it makes a compelling case for it. And again it\u2019s Bitcoin \u2014 this antifragile beast \u2014 going up against gold, something that doesn\u2019t feel pain, inspiration, motivation. It\u2019s an inorganic commodity. And also going up against fiat currency, which is probably the most fragile institution in history. The one certainty that we know about fiat currency is that it collapses time and time again. Then we got into another aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s hardness, and that is \u2014 it has this diversity of custodianship and custody schemas that we\u2019ve never before seen in any other asset. And again this is because Bitcoin is just pure information. The switching costs for custodianship are very low, and that threat of self-custody \u2014 to Saylor\u2019s point \u2014 it always forces custodians to behave honestly. And to deliver custodial services that are very high quality at a very low price. So it\u2019s very frictionless to move your capital from one custodian to another \u2014 it\u2019s what keeps everyone honest and competitive. It imposes this free-market paradigm. The way I\u2019ve described that before too is the five properties of money. Bitcoin is optimized for perfected portability because it\u2019s pure information. So it\u2019s just information, it can move at the speed of light. And because it\u2019s just information that can move at the speed of light and it\u2019s massless, you can code it into so many different hard to find custody schemes. There\u2019s people that have put their private keys into a song or written it into a public article that only they know how to decode. So it\u2019s just radically new and interesting in terms of how you can safeguard this asset. And then we got into a bit of this specter of quantum computer, it\u2019s one of the most popular ways to discredit Bitcoin. Everyone says, Oh when quantum computing breaks through, Bitcoin\u2019s over with! First of all it\u2019s totally ignorant of the fact that if quantum computing did actually occur it would break all of the commercial Internet as we know it: everything that\u2019s protected under cryptography would be rendered useless essentially. So there are massive incentives even outside of Bitcoin to develop quantum resistant encryption in response to a quantum computing breakthrough. But the other point Saylor makes is that Bitcoiners live at the vanguard of this space and they have, again, north of $300 Billion of market cap to protect, and they are interacting with these client server hardware implementations on a daily basis, especially on the mining network. So they\u2019re gonna be the first to see or smell or detect this type of breakthrough coming through and they\u2019ll be the first to adapt! So we left off talking about Bitcoin\u2019s hardware and software update cycles and how they compare to other forms of money. With Bitcoin the hardware refresh cycle for mining hardware specifically tends to be around 1\u20133 years. It\u2019s sometimes a little more extended the closer we\u2019re getting to the 4-year halving cycle. But as more producers enter the space \u2014 producing ASICs \u2014 that cycle is subject to change. But the point is that the hardware protecting the Bitcoin network is always being refreshed. Whether it\u2019s 1 or 4 years. And then the software cycles for Bitcoin vary as well depending on whether it\u2019s node or mining software. That tends to take place within the scope of a year. Regardless, when you compare this to gold, gold is a dumb shiny rock. It undergoes zero hardware or software updates in its 5,000-year use as money. Bitcoin is just so much faster in that respect. Again it\u2019s constantly adapting to new circumstances at a rate to which gold could never hope to do because gold does not have hardware or software \u2014 it does not adapt at all. And that hearkens back to the example Saylor gave: Which one are you gonna choose to bet on? Are you gonna choose the mountain? The static mountain? Or are you gonna bet on the humans that encounter that mountain? Humans that can adapt, develop new tools and ways and innovations of moving the mountain and destroying the mountain. We\u2019re back to this static defense versus an active offense. If the defense is unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of the aggressor then it\u2019s always going to lose! When humans encounter that mountain with this swarm intelligence of ingenuity, we\u2019re figuring out how to drill holes into the rock, plant dynamite in there, blow it up, clear it out, build a road through it. So we\u2019re pointing to where it\u2019s better to place your chips. Whether it\u2019s on the static defense of something like gold or the dynamic defense of something like Bitcoin. Then we got into how money, specifically Bitcoin versus gold and fiat \u2014 it\u2019s much stronger, smarter, and faster. And these aspects, as we\u2019ve touched on early in this series, they\u2019re actually the source of all innovational and evolutional value. Again, the reason mankind dominates the world is because he\u2019s able to coordinate his efforts with others and harness energy and tools in a way that makes him smarter, faster, stronger, than all other creatures in the world. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with innovation! We\u2019re not physically becoming faster, stronger, smarter necessarily, although we do become smarter, clearly. But our collective efforts are becoming smarter, stronger, faster, is the point there. This reminds me of that quote Saylor brought up early in the series that as far as he can tell, Mankind is the only animal that plays with fire. So we figured out\u2014we\u2019re able to self-reflect on the nature of the natural universe and figured out how to harness its gifts and allocate them towards our ends. And that makes us very very unique. This gets into Mises. Mises is one of the fathers of Austrian Economics. He wrote a great book called Human Action. And in Human Action he describes the science of praxeology, which is actually the study of purpose-driven behavior. And it\u2019s: man always takes action with means towards ends. So everything is a means or an ends to man! But things themselves are not means. This table is just a materialist item in the universe, but it becomes means when I allocate my purpose into resting my computer on this table. So we have this very special gift of projecting our intellect into the universe and then actually channeling energy through it. That makes us just radically different than all the other animals. So to get back to money, in terms of how Bitcoin is smarter: first of all it\u2019s programmable. You can imagine\u2014the example he gave was being able to write some automated software that actually created a marketplace for Bitcoin lending and borrowing. And this is a super interesting aspect because it actually has the possibility of facilitating a yield curve for Bitcoin. Yield curve simply means typically a market-based time series that shows you the rate of return you can get on capital by lending it out. Anywhere from 1\u201330 years in the case of US treasuries. That is the last element Bitcoin lacks to become a truly preferable global store of value. That\u2019s the one thing that US treasuries and other government bonds currently have over Bitcoin is that they have a built-in yield. I\u2019ve had some talks with people in Lightning Labs about this. I actually think that could be the route this goes. And if we can develop these time-locked Lightning smart contracts where people are actually putting Bitcoin into a time-locked channel to facilitate Lightning Network liquidity, and then the markets matching that demand for Bitcoin borrow with an interest rate yield \u2014 maybe they\u2019re getting a piece of the transaction fees for the routing fees through Lightning Network. That time series set of smart contracts could become the Bitcoin yield curve that actually leads Bitcoin to becoming this long contemplated pristine collateral, which US treasuries serve the purpose of today. In fact this actually points to another way to think about hard money. If you\u2019re holding gold on a gold standard or you\u2019re holding Bitcoin on a Bitcoin standard, that money tends to appreciate roughly approximate to the aggregate productivity growth of the world, because again it\u2019s holding its scarcity, so as goods and services become relatively more abundant, that money\u2014holding demand constant \u2014 would fetch more goods and services. So if the global GDP is growing at 3% per year, we would expect that on a hard money standard, the hard money itself would grow at about 3% per year. So this is really interesting because that makes hard money on a hard money standard similar to a non-counterparty investment in an index fund invested in global equities. It\u2019s like whatever business is doing whatever in the world to create more goods and services, this hard money that I\u2019m holding with no counterparty risk \u2014 it\u2019s a bearer asset so I\u2019m holding it, I\u2019m custodying it, I\u2019m not subject to default risk with anyone else \u2014 it actually acts as a passive index investment in all of those global equities creating more goods and services! That\u2019s just another way to think about it that I thought was really interesting. Another way that Bitcoin\u2019s smarter is that it\u2019s more defensible. With gold you could put it into a vault, you could secure it with armed guard, put it in a fortress \u2014 whatever. But Bitcoin\u2019s unique in that it can be wrapped in technology layers of security. So you can wrap it in 2FA, Face ID, biometrics, geofencing \u2014 all of these unique software-enabled security schemes are only possible with something like Bitcoin. With gold it\u2019s just not possible because gold will always suffer from the oracle problem. You\u2019ll always need to ultimately trust the custodian of the gold at the end of that chain of security features. Whereas Bitcoin can actually be directly integrated with the software security features. So then looking at Bitcoin as stronger money: to clarify we don\u2019t mean strong like Bitcoin can benchpress a lot of weight, what we mean is channeling energy with force and acceleration. So forcefully channeling energy. That\u2019s what a gun is, right? A gun is one of the strongest offensive technologies because it can repel a bullet with more force and acceleration than a sling or a bow, so a gun is preferred. But in the realm of money it\u2019s all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration into the right place and the right time to generate yield, as we were talking about earlier with the lending market. And this is yet another way Bitcoin is superior to inferior stores of value like gold or equities, because with equities your custodian is gonna hold it, they may be lending your stock to short-sellers and generating yield for themselves. But as an industry standard they do not share that yield with you at all! They also do other weird things like rehypothecation and naked short selling and all types of fraud that are just industry norm today. But with Bitcoin, since it has such a high degree of mobility and visibility, you actually could demand that your custodian lend it to short sellers or do different things \u2014 put it into different buckets of risk to create yield for yourself as you see fit. And that\u2019s just something that you don\u2019t have the option to do with gold or with equities. Because Bitcoin is so mobile, it\u2019s this cross domain asset you can settle with finality anywhere near instantly. It\u2019s highly resistant to custodial collusion and regulatory capture, where the reason you don\u2019t get yield on your equities right now \u2014 whereas the bank does \u2014 is they\u2019ve colluded and made that an industry practice! So Bitcoin, by being this near-instant means of final settlement, it\u2019s collapsing the event of trade with the event of settlement, and it is between those events in traditional finance where all corruption and systemic risk accumulate. Because you can execute a trade but you don\u2019t have to settle with say T+3 or T+5 depending on the asset. And between those times a lot of games are played on Wall Street and in the broader financial landscape! Bitcoin closes that window. Trade and settlement are now effectively the same thing \u2014 you can demand final settlement 24/7 from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. So it just again speaks to Bitcoin\u2019s incorruptible character. Finally getting into how Bitcoin\u2019s faster: as Saylor described it, we\u2019ve essentially dematerialized gold, so we\u2019ve taken the monetary properties of gold but we\u2019ve transitioned them into a tool that\u2019s fully dematerialized, purely informational. And when you look at that through the Einsteinian equation lens of E=MC\u00b2, we\u2019ve taken M to zero \u2014 it\u2019s massless \u2014 so what we\u2019re left with is this massless money that can be moved at the speed of light! And that\u2019s just radically new and interesting. And as we talked about earlier it\u2019s also related to the security aspects. Because it\u2019s pure information you can do a lot of really unique things with it that just aren\u2019t possible with any other asset. So this dematerialization of money, it enables a plethora of high frequency and microtransactions that were simply not possible in the past. And the other thing is that again all of these gatekeepers in traditional finance are the ones taking the vig on market participants, but in Bitcoin we have this economic network that\u2019s bigger than even money \u2014 it\u2019s a global economic network that has almost no gatekeeping essentially, if you\u2019re just transacting peer-to-peer, and therefore has much lower transaction and taxation costs which means there are just less frictions to free trade overall. So this thing is just moving capital much more quickly and with much less friction and impedance. So all this means for market participants \u2014 for Bitcoin HODLers \u2014 is they have more optionality, they\u2019re gonna benefit from more aggregate wealth creation, and the wealth that they do create through this enhanced free trade, they can actually store it in a medium and preserve that wealth in essentially a theft-proof form, or a highly resistant to confiscation form. So all of these things just make Bitcoin much faster and much more securable and when you compare that to something like fiat you just can\u2019t move that off business hours, on holidays, and between countries unless you\u2019re suffering high fees. There\u2019s KYC/AML delays, there\u2019s just all of these frictions to doing business. Whereas Bitcoin you can just send it to anyone, from anywhere in the world, to anywhere in the world at any time of day, and that is just a radical enhancement to the speed or velocity aspects of money! That in a nutshell \u2014 Bitcoin being smarter, stronger, faster, and harder than any other money in history \u2014 is why Bitcoin is freedom money! It is a form of value communication, a language of value if you will, that cannot be muted or manipulated. A guy I talked with today actually called it a super-language object, which I think is interesting! We\u2019ve collapsed a lot of things into speech in the digital age, if you think say the 3D printing of firearms, we would say that\u2019s a 2nd Amendment right, the right to bear arms in the US. But we\u2019ve now collapsed that into the 1st Amendment because code is speech. And Bitcoin interestingly enough has collapsed money into speech, so something really big is going on here! And Bitcoin is at the center of it. And I hope this episode helps show you some of that. I\u2019m excited for the next one. This is Episode 6, we\u2019ve got 3 left and we\u2019ll see you next time!"}

Welcome to Episode 5 of The Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! Super excited for this one! This is episode 2 of us getting into Bitcoin theory, and things are just starting to really heat up and get interesting at this point! So it\u2019s a big episode \u2014 I don\u2019t want to waste a lot of your time here, I\u2019m just gonna run through a few of the topics that we\u2019ll be hearing today. If you haven\u2019t checked out Episodes 1\u20134 yet I suggest you do, because a lot of the foundation that we\u2019ve been building upon up until this point really starts to throw off some good energy here! So today we\u2019re going to be talking about money as power, also, talking about one of my favorite ways to describe money is as an insurance policy on the uncertainty or the entropy of the future. And then we\u2019ll also be looking at debt and how it\u2019s actually a form of anti-energy. And then Saylor delivers a really interesting take on fiat currency in that it\u2019s a way of politically toxifying money, and he drops some really interesting analogies there that I think you\u2019re gonna like. And then we\u2019re gonna deliver a thought experiment that I think is a really simple way of clarifying the value proposition of Bitcoin and its superiority as a store of value in comparison to all other assets. Maybe something you can use in your own arguments with precoiners. And then we\u2019re gonna be talking about some lessons of history and how essentially the most organized group of people tend to win out. We\u2019re gonna be looking at store of value versus medium of exchange in terms of monetary functionality. We\u2019re gonna look at the utility of money and how that tends to drive its market value. We\u2019re also gonna look at the productivity of market participants in a monetary network and how that drives market value. And then finally we\u2019re gonna look at Bitcoin as \u2014 you know, what I\u2019ve argued in the past and what we get into a bit here \u2014 is that Bitcoin is an American technology! Now I do not mean America the nation state, like it was invented in America, I mean the idea of America: the principles of free market capitalism. Bitcoin positively embodies them. Saylor and I get into a unique discussion on that topic. And then we\u2019ll look at and compare and contrast the nature of fiat currency inflation and Bitcoin appreciation and see how they\u2019re polar-opposite forces. And then we conclude by diving into some philosophy! We\u2019re talking a bit about truth and how Bitcoin relates to truth and civilization\u2019s relationship with truth. So, big episode today, excited for you guys to see this! Let\u2019s jump in!"}
{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-5-channeling-monetary-energy-across-time-and-space-92f68a8327ea?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Michael Saylor [06:10]: We\u2019re talking about Bitcoin as the first digital monetary network! I\u2019m positing this thought experiment: I have a $100 Million block of energy. I can generate $100 Million worth of energy through chemical processes, kinetic, gravitational, electrical, atomic power. Let\u2019s just assume that I did some amount of work in order to generate that energy. I converted that energy into money. Money is the highest form of energy! Now I\u2019ve got $100 Million block of money! You can do a lot with $100 Million! It equates to about 3,000 lbs worth of gold, it converts to $100 Million of currency, and we could do the calculation in Bitcoin \u2014 a little bit less than 10,000 Bitcoin at this point in time. Now, I want to do two things with it: I want to channel it through time, and I want to channel it through space. The beauty of Bitcoin channeling through time is that there really is no loss over time, there\u2019s no inflation. You\u2019ve only got the 21 Million Bitcoin, so as a ratio to 21 Million it\u2019s infinitely hard! And so that\u2019s a big check, and if we contrast it to gold and fiat: you\u2019re gonna lose 99.5% of your energy in fiat. You\u2019re gonna lose 98% of your energy in gold. You\u2019re gonna keep all your energy in Bitcoin! So clearly, channeling energy through time is important and it\u2019s critical. Channeling it through space really refers not just to moving it around the world, but it means moving it across domains at well from counterparty to counterparty. We can see the inefficiencies in fiat counterparty to counterparty is: you\u2019re locked into 9-to-5 banking hours, you can\u2019t do big transactions on a Saturday, there are certain jurisdictions where you can\u2019t do transactions at all, you\u2019re always working through a counterparty which is its own risk. And of course if we go to gold, fiat is faster, but it\u2019s still got complexities. Gold is slower \u2014 it\u2019s gonna take a month to physically deliver gold, and so: super slow, super expensive. Neither fiat nor gold make nearly so much sense for channeling energy through time and space! I think that the best metaphor when I think about this is it\u2019s like I want to cross from London to New York City and I need to cross the Atlantic \u2014 and that\u2019s the journey. And if I\u2019m gonna do it with fiat currency it\u2019s like a big rubber raft with a leak in it, and I\u2019m gonna be continually blowing up that raft every day to keep it from sinking on me! And I\u2019m going to get battered this way and that way, and it\u2019s a bit of a venture! On the other hand with gold, it\u2019s like getting in a wooden ship. And it\u2019s gonna rot over the course of many many years, but maybe for the first 2, 3, 4, 5, years \u2014 compared to the rubber raft \u2014 I feel pretty good! But it\u2019s a heavy ship! Wood is heavier than rubber, so it\u2019s kind of harder to get going and it\u2019s harder to maneuver it but it\u2019s a bit more solid. But ultimately it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s going to decay! And then if I put it into a crypto container \u2014 a Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s like a steel vessel. I have a steel hull \u2014 a steel hull container ship really, is the best metaphor \u2014 1,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, moves 30 knots! The thing that\u2019s special about steel is: steel is indestructible as long as you maintain it! The maintenance means: you have to keep it from corroding! It can be attacked by a corrosion, and the way you maintain it is you paint it. You sand it down every 5\u201310 years, you repaint it. If you maintain it, it will last longer than you will last! In fact it will last essentially forever \u2014 hundreds of years! If you punch a hole in a steel hull and then you weld it, the weld is stronger than the original steel. So it is the indestructible, extremely strong, repairable element. And it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you\u2019re going to actually engage in commerce all around the world, you want a bunch of steel container ships! You do not want wooden ships, and you certainly don\u2019t want inflatables! And that\u2019s the distinction and that\u2019s why Bitcoin is really such an extraordinary invention! We talked about getting out of the gravity well \u2014 the other metaphor is: I have $100 Million worth of energy. If I can get it into a vacuum and vacuum seal it\u2014it\u2019s like when we want to keep food forever we vacuum seal the food\u2014we want to keep bacteria from attacking it. We want to keep natural parasites and pathogens from attacking our food energy! And so the way that you protect your food energy and stabilize it forever is you vacuum seal it! And the way you protect your monetary energy from parasites and from decay and from rotting is you vacuum seal it! And that is the genius of Bitcoin! When I say that the destiny is to be encrypted, it\u2019s like vacuum sealing your food. You\u2019re taking monetary energy in fiat that can decay, debase, diffuse, and you\u2019re encrypting it in an encrypted container such that no one else can touch it, no one else can screw with it. And when you think about all these miners, these miners are power plants, they\u2019re plugged into analog energy, but they\u2019re modulating the analog, physical, pure energy through the SHA-256 protocol to make it a wall of encrypted energy, if not a cloud of encrypted energy and the rails of encrypted energy! If you want to pass through that, if you want to attack that, you have to go through that wall of SHA-256 encrypted energy! And all of our monetary energy is protected and floating in the cloud behind that wall! And it\u2019s a fairly unique wall. And that\u2019s the majesty of Bitcoin."}

And I guess that takes us to our next interesting question, which is: So how big can the Bitcoin network get? And how is it going to absorb more power? I\u2019m measuring: money is power \u2014by the way, the cliche, Money is Power, it\u2019s not a cliche! \u2014 it\u2019s a deep reality! Money is the highest form of power, the superset of all power. Kinetic energy?\u2014I can take bows and arrows and guns, club you to death and take your money \u2014 take your value! With a war, I can convert kinetic energy into power. Atomic energy into power. Chemical energy I can burn and create power. Gravitational energy \u2014 dam a river and create power. And ultimately that power becomes money! But I can\u2019t do the opposite \u2014maybe I can do the opposite \u2014 I can take a money and I can convert it back into the other things. But money is the amalgam of all powers that mankind has managed to collect! And so the question really is: How much money, how much power can fall into Bitcoin? And there\u2019s a lot of debate in the community. For example the most famous model is the S2F model. And a lot of Bitcoiners talk about stock to flow and it\u2019s like, Well, as Bitcoin gets harder, its price is going up! Well I mean the power in the network is directly proportional to the price because it\u2019s equal to 21 Million times the price! That\u2019s the power in the network! You could almost think of it as a voltage or something too \u2014 the higher the voltage, the more energy passes through the electrical network. So I see the price as the voltage, and I think that its stock to flow is an interesting transcendental model \u2014 a particular model \u2014 as we\u2019re moving through a short period, early history of Bitcoin, where the rate of block rewards is falling dramatically! But I think that as you look toward the future of the chain as it asymptotically goes to 21 Million and as the block rewards go to zero and the entire network flips over to transaction fees, then you start to think, Well just because it\u2019s hard, that\u2019s not gonna explain why it\u2019s valuable! [16:50] It\u2019s hard to synthesize Polonium or Uranium! By the way, it\u2019s really hard to create steel! Really hard! Like steel power plants, if the steel overflows, it hits the concrete, it blows up \u2014 kills everybody! It\u2019s hard to deal with nitroglycerin. There\u2019s a lot of hard things in the world. And there\u2019s some things that are nearly impossible \u2014 I will probably never walk on the sun! Impossible! But, the impossibility of something doesn\u2019t make it valuable. What makes it valuable is some other dynamics! And I have a simple model, and I Tweeted this model the other day: I think the success of Bitcoin and the network power ultimately is a function of the adoption, the utility, the productivity, and the inflation. Those four. And they\u2019re big brand concepts that are vectors, they\u2019re not like one number \u2014 they\u2019re ideas! But the adoption idea is: a monetary network is gonna be as big as the amount of asset holders that adopt it as their primary treasury reserve asset. So for example: if a million people with $100 each decide to HODL their $100 and they put $100 Million into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network\u2019s worth $100 Million! If a company $100 Million decides to HODL their $100 Million in Bitcoin, the lowbrow or the historic colloquial term is HODL \u2014 Hold On for Dear Life or just HODL or save, whatever \u2014 and the highbrow term would be, Adopt as a treasury reserve asset!"}

And if I was just a Bitcoin maximalist, I loved it and I got it \u2014 I\u2019m HODLing! And that\u2019s why I love the HODLers! That\u2019s why they\u2019re my people \u2014 I love them! They\u2019re HODLing! And they figured it out before I figured it out! And I give them credit: they figured it out and that\u2019s genius! But I\u2019m not too proud to learn. Some other \u2014 you gotta believe, if I looked a million years ago and some dude comes up with fire, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not the guy that\u2019s gonna say, I\u2019m not doing that \u2014 that wasn\u2019t my idea! Could I borrow some of that fire, Sir? And thank you! Thank you, for bringing life to me! So, adoption: the number of individuals and the number of entities that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 not measured in numbers, measured in monetary energy in whatever US dollar equivalents, but they\u2019re converting their fiat (Euros, Yen, Pesos, Dollars) \u2014 the total US dollar amount of fiat that is converted into Bitcoin for the purposes of holding as a treasury reserve asset! You see that the traders, the speculators \u2014 they\u2019re short term interesting, but over the long term they don\u2019t really have any value to the network, right? Someone that\u2019s going to buy $1 Million of Bitcoin today and sell it tomorrow? They\u2019re not going to drive network energy, because they\u2019re going to rob the network of energy as fast as they fed the network. They are mercenaries! The Roman Empire was built on citizen soldiers willing to fight and die to protect what they believed in! At the point that you\u2019re hiring mercenaries to fight and not die as long as you pay them \u2014 your empire\u2019s over! So, the HODLers \u2014 people that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 they\u2019re citizens of Bitcoin! They\u2019re citizens of the network! And if you decide it\u2019s 20% of your treasury reserves \u2014 like, it\u2019s a matter of faith! How committed are you? If you really committed like, say, Microstrategy \u2014 I had $500 Million worth of money I didn\u2019t need! I had two choices: I can buy the stock back or buy Bitcoin with it. Well I bought as much stock back as the shareholders wanted to sell to us, because that was the appropriate, respectful thing to do \u2014 to put a tender offer! And then whatever\u2019s left, we convert! The treasury is our reserve asset, which is our reserve energy! It is our life force! Treasury is life force! It\u2019s not unlike fat. Fat is nature\u2019s organic battery. You carry 30 lbs of fat, that means you\u2019ll probably be able to live an extra 60\u201390 days without food when the going gets tough! And so it\u2019s an organic battery. A treasury is an organic battery. Or it\u2019s a monetary battery for a family, an individual, a company, or a country! You have no treasury? You\u2019re gonna die very quickly when the crisis hits! You\u2019re gonna be insolvent!"}

Whatever you\u2019re holding it in is basically an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future! Because this cash balance or this treasury reserve gives you pure optionality in the marketplace, you\u2019re best able to contend with unforeseen developments! Another thing, just to jump back to the power and money relationship, I think it\u2019s very interesting to look at power through the physics definition. Physics defines power as work over time! That\u2019s what gold was: it was reflective of our collective work over time, and it was a claim on that work over time in the form of capital! And the other thing\u2014you were drawing the analogy to the vacuum sealing to protect it from parasites \u2014 I think we could all agree that work is kind of the opposite of theft, right? You don\u2019t create any value by theft, you just steal the value of others\u2019 work. And that\u2019s essentially what inflation is! So, money being power, there\u2019s a big incentive to store it in a medium that is as much protected from theft as possible! And I think that\u2019s getting to the core value proposition of what Bitcoin represents!"}

It\u2019s an encrypted energy crucible in which we store the precious energy of life! And we\u2019re insulating it via an encrypted vacuum layer from all the things that would bleed off or steal that heat or steal the energy, be it a political exchange or just physical \u2014 there are a lot of ways to lose the energy of life! And Bitcoin solves that problem! Now how do we get energy into this system? There are a lot of metaphors for heat exchange, and if you look at closed systems, a closed system in thermodynamics is: mass cannot leave or enter \u2014 only heat! So let\u2019s assume that 21 Million Bitcoin is the mass\u2014it cannot leave or enter! Heat can come! If I\u2019m buying Bitcoin at a price higher than the rolling 3-year average, or the rolling 200-week average \u2014 I\u2019m heating it up! And if I\u2019m selling it at a price lower than the rolling average for whatever time frame you care about \u2014 let\u2019s say that 4 years is your time reference frame \u2014 if I\u2019m selling it at a price lower than the 200-week moving average, I\u2019m cooling it down! So people see Bitcoin trading day-to-day, and they\u2019re like, Oh it\u2019s lower than yesterday! That\u2019s not what I see! I see it as: If it\u2019s trading at $10,000 and the 200-week rolling average was $7,000, I see it heating up! I see its capacitor gathering energy! And that\u2019s a very important way to think of it. Now we come back to this issue of adoption: you can adopt Bitcoin with varying degrees of commitment. It\u2019s like joining a religion, right? So I adopt Bitcoin as my treasury reserve asset, and then do I commit 50% of my reserves to it? Or 1%? Or 99%? Or 100%? What is the true adoption rate? How much do you really believe it? Is it a hedge? Is it a 1% hedge \u00e0 la Paul Tudor Jones? Or is it a 100% commitment \u00e0 la Michael Saylor? Right? I said, No hedge! No speculation! 100% commitment! Just like your body is 100% committed to storing excess energy in fat! 100% commitment! There\u2019s no other thing! I like your analogy of an insurance policy, except that I would say: an all-powerful insurance policy with no caveats! Because the problem with most insurance policies is: I have an insurance policy on my restaurant, but it doesn\u2019t cover pandemics! And so I\u2019m bankrupt! Have you noticed how many insurance policies are not paying off in the pandemic? Because there\u2019s a carve-out: Well we only insure against a \u2014 only if this happens and that happens, and if you didn\u2019t do this and if nobody said that and if the government didn\u2019t do this, then in that case I will give you some money!"}

And I get to take the $99 Million and buy something else with it, but I\u2019ve assumed risk \u2014 I\u2019ve taken on counterparty risk in order to get the insurance policy.

And that\u2019s what is so deeply profound about Bitcoin is that it is a set of rules that we cannot break! It is an exception-proof money supply! And it\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve ever had! And by eliminating that attack vector such that any group could be sovereign over the money, it effectively makes everyone individually maximally sovereign! And that\u2019s one of the great breakthroughs of Bitcoin!"}

If you look at the corruption and the decimation, the destruction, in our society, and the devastation in our economy, there are two things that everyone fears: individual bankruptcy and corporate insolvency. Becoming insolvent as an individual or as an entity. How many times have you heard the story, That was a really good company, but they took on too much debt and they couldn\u2019t make their interest and they were broken up and they closed the factories and they moved away and now we\u2019re eat manufactured slop from a machine because our favorite vendor got destroyed. There are a lot of companies that get destroyed. How does it happen? Well they have treasuries in fiat, the fiat\u2019s inflating, so the CFO thinks, Well I cannot afford to invest this! It\u2019s not politically acceptable to invest in stocks or equity that keeps up with inflation. If I invest in bonds, I can\u2019t keep up with inflation, and so I start buying my stock back, and I borrow money to buy my stock back. So if I have $100 Million in treasury and I borrow $100 Million and then I buy back $150 Million worth of stock, I get the stock up, but now my treasury is -$50 Million in net treasury instead of +$100 Million, right? So I went from having a positive position\u2014it\u2019s like you have enough fat to live for 30 days without food, to a negative position \u2014 you have no fat, you\u2019re in debt, and there\u2019s a banker that clicks on a Feed You button every day, and if the banker decides to pull the plug on your credit line, you\u2019re instantly eviscerated! And so a company in debt with no liquid assets has no energy! It\u2019s in energy debt! So what that means is, Maybe you generate $100 Million in cash flow a year and you\u2019ve got $500 Million or $1 Billion in debt and you need $90 Million as EBITDA to cover the covenants. That means you have a $10 Million cushion! That means you have a $2 Million a quarter cushion! That means that in any given quarter, if you were short $3 Million on a $500 Million number, that $3 Million kicks you into default on your debt and renders you potentially \u2014 it renders your capital worthless! It can drive your equity to zero! And it can render you insolvent, you lose your sovereignty and the creditor can take control of your company \u2014 you lose everything! It\u2019s the same as: I go onto an exchange and I\u2019m trading at 50:1 or 100:1 leverage. The idea that I\u2019m going to pledge 1 Bitcoin and get control of 100 Bitcoin, and if it goes down by 100 bucks I\u2019m going to be utterly wiped out is a pretty silly idea! I would not recommend it to anybody other than an addicted gambler! If your goal is, I\u2019m okay losing all of this\u2014and that\u2019s just like going to Vegas or going to Bitcoinville \u2014 if that\u2019s what you want to do, then call it a gambling habit! But there\u2019s nothing rational about it! The leverage could be thought of as every entity \u2014 be it a government or a corporation \u2014 is draining their life energy, pouring it out, when you flip from having a positive treasury to a negative treasury. I have drained my entity of my life force, and I\u2019m living at the pleasure of my creditors or my counterparties, wherever and whoever they may be! I\u2019ve lost my sovereignty!"}

To your point, there\u2019s no adequate store of value, so people at the individual and corporate level are forced into the use of leverage! The assumption of debt! Because the real debt load is actually eroding via inflation over time, so there\u2019s an incentive to take on debt. But this is a very short-sighted strategy, because now you are hyper-exposed to the inherent volatility of the future! So once there\u2019s any form of shock\u2014COVID or any other form of economic shock \u2014 you can go to zero immediately! You get wiped out! Versus holding cash \u2014 makes you antifragile!

And the cash will actually be worth more over time! And that\u2019s what Jeff Booth points out. But every technologist knows this! If there was no inflation, the cash would buy more over time, and my entire simple monetary strategy would be: save cash and over time I\u2019ll improve. But in a currency war, the political system declares war on the currency and makes the cash toxic! And if it\u2019s 2% toxic, that\u2019s like injecting a mild drug into your veins. When it becomes 10% toxic, it\u2019s like a poison in your veins.

Toxic shock! The toxic shock of the system. But, let\u2019s move back to our happy subject! How does the Bitcoin energy network grow? Well, adoption! So a million people adopt it as their 90% treasury reserve asset and they have $1 Million each, and now you\u2019ve got $1 Million times a thousand is a billion, a million times a million is a trillion, right? So a million millions gets you to a trillion in the network, they put the money in the network and the network is the syndication of all of the treasury energy of the people that choose to adopt it as their primary treasury reserve. So when a million people put a million dollars in it\u2019s a trillion dollar network. When a thousand companies put a billion dollars in, it\u2019s another trillion dollar network, so now you\u2019re up to $2 Trillion! When a hundred companies put a billion in or $100 Billion in \u2014 you go the next level! So as individuals, families, private companies, public companies, government agencies, small governments, municipalities, states, small countries, mid-size countries, big countries, all the non-profit organizations \u2014 as they adopt this as their treasury reserve asset, they don\u2019t need to adopt it as their currency, medium of exchange! They don\u2019t need to adopt it as their unit of measure! As it becomes their store of value, their treasury reserve asset, as they adopt it, the network syndicates all their energy, and the decision of Apple to buy $100 Billion worth of it would accrue to the benefit of a million HODLers that bought $100,000 each or $1 Million each or $50,000 or whatever they bought! The beauty of it is that everybody is pro rata, pari passu benefiting. And it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to bring everybody else in, right? And it\u2019s a network effect, that as someone comes in, someone else comes in, the price moves up, the people that were in it get a benefit, and now we get to this next dynamic \u2014 with me pausing to say: without adoption, without people believing that this should be their treasury reserve asset, without that, you have nothing! So it\u2019s not enough to say it\u2019s just hard! People have to love Bitcoin more than they love gold, silver, Apple stock, Amazon, Facebook \u2014 whatever! By the way, we didn\u2019t touch on it much, but if we consider Bitcoin as an energy network versus Facebook or Apple as an energy network, the issue there is: I gotta look out 100 years and say, Will I be able to put $100 Million in Apple stock, hold it for 100 years \u2014 and what\u2019s my exposure? And of course your exposure is: income tax on the company, sales tax on their product, tariff exchanges, regulatory interaction, income tax on their employees, all sorts of other taxes you can come up with, plus many other regulatory actions including and likely being the ultimate regulation of these things as public utilities, because if they weren\u2019t regulated as public utilities, the richest guy in every city would be the guy that owns the electrical power plant! And that guy would be richer than Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or anything! The only reason that these guys are rich is because they\u2019re in a new novel unregulated area that was not deemed to be important! And the problem is, as soon as it is deemed to be important enough that you can\u2019t live without it, then it becomes a God-given right to have access to your YouTube or to your iPhone or to your whatever, and now the entire value proposition differs! I mean we live in a society right now where people think equity is the perfect store of value! What they don\u2019t realize is: it\u2019s possible for the equity to go to zero! For example, a nationalized power station has zero equity! It still works! When stuff gets nationalized, be it education, power, electricity, technology \u2014 the equity goes to zero! You can have something with an equity zero and the debt has value. You can have something where the equity has no value, the debt has no value, but the underlying vendors are getting paid. It can shift back and forth \u2014 it\u2019s a political thing! So with regard to Bitcoin and the value of the network, it comes down to people making the commitment to adopt it as their treasury reserve asset at all levels. It\u2019s just as good for us if Norway adopts it for their treasury reserve as it is some big charity as it is the Rockefeller Foundation or the Hughes Institute or Harvard or Stanford or MIT or for a private company or a public company or an agency of the government. Maybe the county or a city that you live in or the fire department or a union or a pension fund! And then there\u2019s all the investors, right? Hedge funds, pensions funds, insurance companies! There are a lot of entities that have monetary energy. They either need it to operate or they stored it up in trust for their shareholders or for future generations, etc. So as that energy flows, the network strengthens! Now that\u2019s the first order dynamic. It\u2019s simple network effect. We\u2019re syndicating our power. No different than \u2014 let\u2019s say that there are a hundred of us in a football field, and you organize 50 people to be on your tug-of-war team, and I can only get 5 on mine, and the rest are all singletons \u2014 your team wins! If there\u2019s a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins! Usually the Romans kicked everybody\u2019s ass for nearly a thousand years! Because they were the most organized! When they put their petty differences aside for 700 years, they beat everybody else. And then when they started fighting with each other there\u2019s the decay and eventually when they were disorganized, that disorganization causes a deterioration in power. So it\u2019s the most organized that wins. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in 8th grade football or whether you\u2019re in high school or in college. Whatever it is! Organization is always critical!"}

And also debunking what I would call the alternative narrative that money needs to be adopted as a medium of exchange to proliferate as a network. You do have to HODL or adopt it as a treasury reserve asset\u2014in an economic sense \u2014 to create reservation demand for that asset. You\u2019re taking that asset off the market. You\u2019re reducing its supply, thereby increasing its price. And that\u2019s what creates the bootstrapping effect, this monetization process. And that again hearkens back to this evolutionary path where you have it as a store of value first. After it\u2019s created enough value, it can be used as a medium of exchange, because those early HODLers had more of an incentive to use it as a medium of exchange. And then finally when its been widely accepted enough, it\u2019s being used as a unit of account. To your point about organization, HODLers are all perfectly aligned to 21 Million! It\u2019s just the energy efficient strategy is to just HODL! It\u2019s very simple, hard to disrupt, hard to disorganize because there\u2019s not a lot of activity on the part of the HODLer, so it seems like an indomitable strategy in the market for money!"}

The people that are trading in it don\u2019t really understand it, because if they understood it they would just buy it and HODL it! And sometimes people think they\u2019re accomplishing something, but they\u2019re accomplishing not that much! If a hundred entities buy $1 Billion each, then the value of the network\u2019s gonna go up by more than $100 Billion, and if they just buy it and park it in a cyber-vault and don\u2019t touch it for 100 years, it doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s going up! The fact that they poured their energy into the container is actually what caused the energy network to grow! The moving in and out is actually wasting and dissipating energy! You\u2019re just dissipating energy to come and go, and ultimately the success of the thing \u2014 I hear these people, they talk about store of value, medium of exchange. Well, Bitcoin is the high frequency store of value and a low frequency medium of exchange! That\u2019s what it needs to be and technically that\u2019s what it is! And if you understand that, once you get it, you realize you shouldn\u2019t fight that! So for example: I buy $1 Billion of Bitcoin. Every second, it keeps anybody from stealing my Bitcoin! Every second, it\u2019s storing the value! No government, no parasite, no thief, no hacker is taking my billion dollars every second for the next million years! It\u2019s working! In the same way that I put that energy into a vacuum package and every second it\u2019s staying vacuum sealed, and the whole point was to live forever! And so if I gave you a little crypto-field that made you live forever and never age, you would say, High frequency longevity device \u2014 it works pretty well! And you wouldn\u2019t have a problem \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with living forever! It\u2019s immortal energy! So that\u2019s high frequency. The problem is, people don\u2019t recognize that every second of the day they\u2019re being attacked. You are being attacked! Every second of the day there\u2019s bacteria and there\u2019s viruses trying to kill you! If I said, I\u2019m gonna spin up a field that stops them from killing you, it\u2019s gonna work a million years, and you\u2019re not gonna notice it \u2014 you would think that\u2019s a pretty good trick! But that is in fact what happens when you actually store value! Now, low frequency medium of exchange: in order for Bitcoin to have its antifragile properties and utility, we have to be able to move it on occasion. Maybe once a year I move it from one cyber crypto bank to another one, or one cyber vault to another one, or once a decade. Or maybe when I\u2019m gonna die I need to transfer it to somebody or split it between my daughter and my son. Or maybe not, maybe I just have one key and I give it to my one child. They give it to their one child, they give it to their one child \u2014 then it never gets transferred! Maybe once a year I have to take 5% of my Bitcoin out of my vault, convert it to fiat, and then break that into 100,000 little parts and put it on Apple Pay and use it to pay for Ubers and Domino\u2019s Pizza and credit card bills. Okay! Once a year I take a chunk out of my piggy bank, my crypto bank, and I put it into fiat, and I do whatever I\u2019m gonna do with it \u2014 maybe! And maybe\u2014if the world works the way you\u2019d think it might work\u2014I just put $100 Million into the vault, I never take it out, I just borrow against it! I just borrow $3 Million a year, $1 Million a year \u2014 tax free! I don\u2019t recognize income, I don\u2019t generate a capital gain tax, I don\u2019t generate an operating income tax. If I borrow money in cash and if my Bitcoin is going up 20% a year \u2014 that\u2019s the real yield\u2014and I can borrow money at 5%, then my effective arbitrage is 15%! So it never makes sense to sell it, ever! In fact, if you look at people that use real estate as a store of value, the way it works is, My family buys a block in Manhattan for $10 Million in 1900. It goes up 8% a year\u2014it doubles every 10 years. It\u2019s worth $20 Million, then $40 Million, then $80 Million, and then $160 Million, and by the time you get out 80 years, you got a billion dollars worth of real estate in Manhattan. You\u2019re not selling it! You haven\u2019t done one transaction in a hundred years! All you\u2019ve done is pledged it as collateral against the loan and you\u2019ve borrowed $42 Million against it and you\u2019re paying 3% interest. And that $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! You didn\u2019t pay 42% tax on $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! That\u2019s not a capital gain! It\u2019s not a long term capital gain! It\u2019s not a short term capital gain! It\u2019s a liability! You\u2019ve generated $42 Million of liabilities against a non-taxed asset. The only way it\u2019s getting taxed is you\u2019re just suffering from real estate taxes, right? But, if you\u2019re in a jurisdiction where inflation is high, real estate tax is low, interest is low, then your secret to living well forever tax-free is just borrow against your stationary assets! And so that\u2019s the news of this week: Donald Trump has $400 Million in debt and paid no taxes for a decade. But he\u2019s not unique! You could substitute every real estate magnate, a family that had generational wealth in real estate, they all did it! All of \u2018em! How do rich people live well and pay no taxes? Not by selling stuff! Not by transacting stuff! The way that they actually live is they just park an asset on the balance sheet, and they never ever ever ever trade it! They just finance it or borrow against it \u2014 and once in a blue moon, once in a decade, somebody wants to pay me triple what it\u2019s worth \u2014 and maybe I do it, but oftentimes, the Warren Buffett school of thought is, The taxes kill you! And so the ideal holding period for an asset is forever! He says it\u2019s forever like I\u2019m committed to it \u2014 yeah! But it\u2019s the taxes that murder you, and so the ideal holding period is forever because then you can pledge it and borrow against it. How do you get rich? You buy an asset, it goes up, you borrow against it to buy another asset, and it goes up, you borrow against it, you buy another asset, and it goes up, and pretty soon you\u2019ve generated all these assets that are highly appreciated with massive built-in capital gains that you\u2019re never ever gonna recognize! Obviously that can change in different types of jurisdictions where politicians decide they\u2019re just gonna tax you on unrealized capital gains, but \u2014"}

How frequently is the collateral marked to market? So for example, if you borrow money to buy a house and it\u2019s a 30-year mortgage and if the bank says to you, they\u2019re never gonna mark it down. Right? There\u2019s some loans like a mortgage loan where they\u2019ll never get marked down. They might get marked up \u2014 you can go to the bank and you can petition them to revalue your loan but nobody ever went to the bank and said, Mark my house to the market after the real estate market crashed! So if you buy a $1 Million house with an $800,000 loan, and you got $800,000 in debt and it\u2019s never marked to market then there\u2019s not that much fragility as long as you can make the $25,000 a year interest payment, assuming 3%, right? So that\u2019s not that risky \u2014 I mean a little bit risky, you can\u2019t make $25,000 and you lose it \u2014 but on the margin, if I didn\u2019t have the million bucks or I didn\u2019t have the $800,000 and somebody was willing to give me the $800,000 house for free, and all I did was pay $25,000 a year \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good trade off! The worst that happens is they take the house back and I go do it again somewhere else. So that\u2019s not very fragile! How does it get fragile? It gets fragile when you buy a $1 Million worth of stock on a $800,000 loan and you\u2019ve got loan-to-value of 80%. And now, the stock trades down 20%! And the stock trades down 20% and the banker marks the collateral every day. And if you\u2019re in a swap with the bank, they will mark it to market every day. Every single day, they calculate the value of collateral, and if you\u2019re under you have to wire them the money the next day! And if you\u2019re over, they in theory have to wire you the money! And you have to mark it to market every day \u2014 that\u2019s risky! So if you were gonna buy $100 stock, you probably don\u2019t want to borrow more than 50%, but if you borrow 50% you damn well better think that the volatility\u2019s not gonna be 50%! You can\u2019t afford to! So probably in that case, if you thought the volatility was that it could lose half its value, you\u2019d want to borrow no more than 25%! And if you wanted to hold the stock even if it loses 80% of the value you can\u2019t borrow more than 20% loan-to-value, right? So the big risk, the hyper-risk is one of these Bitcoin exchanges that go 100:1 in leverage and I mark to market every hour! What if I mark to market every minute, Robert? I mean that the BitMex liquidation! I basically bought 100 Bitcoin, I pledge 1 Bitcoin, it gets marked to market every minute, and if the price goes down $100 I get wiped out and there\u2019s a crash! And it happens in 3 seconds. So that\u2019s risky. If you want to take the opposite point of view, I have 100 Bitcoin and I\u2019m gonna borrow the equivalent of 1 Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin in value, and as long as it doesn\u2019t go more than 90% down, I\u2019m good. But if you wanted to save for one, you would say, I\u2019m gonna borrow against the collateral but I want you to agree that you won\u2019t ever mark it to market \u2014 that\u2019s what real estate loans are! Or a bank: I\u2019m gonna loan you money against your artwork or against your boat or against some other interesting collectible, and every year or every 5 years our appraiser is gonna reappraise it. So the issue is the frequency of the appraisal, combined with the volatility of the asset combined with the political regime you\u2019re in combined with the loan-to-value! If you\u2019re in a political regime where it\u2019s unacceptable to let real estate values go down, then you can reasonably expect that it\u2019s not likely your house is gonna be worth 20% of what you bought it for because the politicians won\u2019t let that happen! But they might not protect your Picasso painting! So if I borrowed money against a Picasso painting and the banker said we\u2019re gonna mark it to market every month, that\u2019s not as good as once a decade! So when you\u2019re thinking about risk, you\u2019re thinking about, How liquid is the collateral? And how frequent is the mark to market? And then how much is the loan-to-value? And that\u2019s how you get to a question of risk and what you should do and not do! I\u2019m not saying you have to do it, by the way! You could just sell the Bitcoin highly appreciated for cash, pay the tax, and take zero risk! And look, if the interest rate was 18% and you thought that the economy was gonna grow at 3\u20134%, then you would sell and you wouldn\u2019t take on the debt! So it\u2019s a function of interest rates as well, and productivity. Let\u2019s go back to this issue of our power equation: adoption, utility, productivity, inflation. We talked about adoption, and my point there was you\u2019re just syndicating \u2014 if the world was static, in a static world where there\u2019s $1 Trillion of assets, if you get $100 Billion on the network then that\u2019s better than $10 Billion! And $500 Billion is better than $100 Billion! And in a static world it\u2019s just all about recruiting and getting people to join the network. But the world is not strictly speaking static! The next thing is dynamic, and technology is what makes it dynamic! And that\u2019s where utility comes in! So if I can take Bitcoin and I can buy it from Square Cash, it\u2019s got more utility! If I can send it as $22 \u2014 if I can send it from Square Cash \u2014 if Square will convert my Bitcoin into dollars and send it in a split second, it\u2019s got more utility! If Apple Computer builds it into Apple Pay, and I can link a small wallet with 1% of my Bitcoin into Apple Pay and I can zap that around on my iPhone, it\u2019s got more utility! If Kraken creates a crypto bank and they offered me 4% interest and they\u2019ll offer it to me with institutional low-risk counterparty and they represent to me that they\u2019ve got $100 Billion of insurance and I can give them my crypto wallet and I get 4% interest on it or 6% and I trust them, the utility just went up again, and Bitcoin becomes more valuable! If I get to the point where I can manage my crypto keys using my retina scanner face ID and give speech instructions and I can say, Send Robert $37 of my crypto in cash \u2014 and if it always works and I just did it and it\u2019s more secure than a hardware key and I don\u2019t have to remember my 12 [word] seed key or whatever and it never fails \u2014 utility went up! Right? If I can say, Robert \u2014 maybe I\u2019ve got a girlfriend, Lisa\u2014 I could say, Send Lisa flowers on her birthday every year for the next decade \u2014 click! And it\u2019s jacked into my crypto\u2014utility went up! There\u2019s a lot of ways utility can go up. Buying stuff, selling stuff, etc. It\u2019s all a function of technology. If the Lightning Network works. In the ideal world, back to my example, I have X money \u2014 $10 Million \u2014 I have $100,000 in my checking account. I say, Move $100,000 in checking, leave the rest in the bank yielding 7% interest \u2014 tie my checking account into Apple Pay, link that to my Uber account, my sister\u2019s Uber account, my Domino\u2019s account, and use it to pay off Netflix, Google, this, that, and the other thing, and pledge it as trusted collateral on some dating network to show that I\u2019m a real person, and then use it to automatically pay all my fees on my domain registrations every year when they become due. There I just set it! I just did it \u2014 that\u2019s utility! That\u2019s [what we\u2019re looking for! 1:06:09]"}

Well we have a million HODLers and they put $1 Million each into the network and now we have $1 Trillion in the network. Adopting it as your primary treasury reserve assets means sweeping your excess cash flows into Bitcoin, so those million people put $1 Million each, but how much money do they make each year, and how much do they save each year? So let\u2019s say they make $100,000 a year, and they save $10,000 a year. So $10,000 times a million \u2014 $10 Billion! So in that case $10 Billion in fiat gets converted into Bitcoin every year! That\u2019s the productivity! If they all get a raise \u2014 next year it\u2019ll be $11 Billion. The next year it\u2019ll be $12 Billion. If they all start their own business, the near year it\u2019ll be $30 Billion. If the economy\u2019s growing and they\u2019re inventing cool stuff and one of them becomes the next Michael Dell or Bill Gates or whatever, that person\u2019s gonna put in $100 Billion or $50 Billion! If you get lucky and one of your HODLers is Jeff Bezos he\u2019s gonna put in $37 Billion! So the productivity of the individuals is going to sweep cash flows into the network. And the same is true with the productivity of the corporations! So Microstrategy, we put $500 Million into a network, we make $50 Million a year. If we generate $50 Million a year after tax, we sweep that into the treasury, right? And do that 10 years in a row, our initial $500 Million is going to become $500 Million more of discounted cash flow! So now we\u2019re just back to some basic finance theory: What\u2019s the value of the stock? It\u2019s equal to the balance sheet cash value plus the discounting of the cash flows. The discounted value of the cash flows over time! So, the treasury that gets put in is the initial slug, and the discounted value of the cash flows of all the people in the network is the next value proposition. Of course, this kind of dovetails nicely with economic theory, because if the overall worldwide economy is flat and not growing, then the cash flows are not gonna grow! If the overall economy tanks and starts to deteriorate, the cash flows will deteriorate! If I destroy the economy, cash flows are going to zero, no value will accrete! And if I invent an atomic overthruster that gives you infinite energy in a sugar cube, presumably productivity is gonna go through the roof and cash flows are gonna go through the roof! So ultimately we\u2019re getting a bunch of people to join the network and then all of our fates are intertwined with all of our productivities! We\u2019ve created a cyber economy! Just like Warren Buffett said, Never bet against the United States. The United States was a 20th century physical economy and every business in it was working to the benefit of every other business in a competitive capitalist Darwinian ecosystem. Well now we\u2019re actually creating a cyber economy where you can be in a relationship with anybody else to the extent that, Robert, you adopt as a HODLer and I adopt as a corporate treasurer! If I\u2019m successful, you benefit! If you\u2019re successful, I benefit! Obviously, if we can get Apple Computer to put $100 Billion in and then sweep $50 Billion a year, we all benefit! And when a country does it, they benefit. And of course, if the people that join the network are more responsible, if they actually are productive and they save more than they spend, or they earn more in revenue than they spend in cost, then the network grows. And if they spend more on revenue, flip it the other way \u2014 a million HODLers all of a sudden save their money and then they start going crazy and partying and quit their jobs and buy Lambos and blow it all on champagne and gambling, they start drawing down their balances in the Bitcoin network and they sell their Bitcoin for fiat! And if they\u2019re selling it for fiat they\u2019re draining it out of the network! So the network is going to accrete with virtuous economic behavior and debase and dilute with vices!"}

Because it was indeed a place in the world with the lowest impediments to free trade that actually led to America creating the most wealth and the most capital. And in many ways I think Bitcoin positively embodies a lot of the founding principles of American free market capitalism. You have inviolable property rights in Bitcoin, which in the American ecosystem actually marginally disrespected through Quantitative Easing and fiat currency printing. There\u2019s a rule of law here in the US, so we have non-violent dispute resolution and enforcement of contract law, and clearly the Bitcoin network is the most adept network at reaching global consensus we\u2019ve ever created! And then kind of from the first view, honest money or hard money would be something else that a real capitalist system puts out. So it\u2019s almost as if America as an experiment was the closest thing to pure capitalism we had prior to Bitcoin. Because again the nation state always gives in to that temptation to violate the money supply and thereby violate the private property rights of the citizens."}

I\u2019ve described Bitcoin as a swarm of cyber hornets behind a wall of encrypted energy. Well the United States is a swarm of military assets: the navy, army, and air force, behind a wall of water! The insulation is the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean! 3,000 miles of water \u2014 you have to go through the army, the navy, and the air force, and that protected a bunch of capitalists, a bunch of entrepreneurs. In service of the goddess of wisdom, in this case in service of the American way! The American businesses pursuing the American Dream unhindered by interruption because they\u2019re behind a wall of water. You know if you go to Poland, they\u2019re good people too! I\u2019ve been there! I have a lot of Polish employees \u2014 they\u2019re brilliant! Between Russia and Germany. Again, Trotsky\u2019s point, You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you! It\u2019s kind of hard to go about your business when people are rolling over you with tanks this way and that way. And the equivalent of that in a monetary system or an energy system is with someone stealing your energy! Okay? How do I keep my coffee warm? I put it in a thermos! I need to insulate my energy so that no one steals it! If I take your Starbucks coffee and I put it in a cooler of ice and I drop it in the ice your coffee\u2019s getting cold! And so the wall of encrypted energy is the insulator. The wall of water is the insulator. The insulator is the insulator. The vacuum is the insulator. If you want a crucible of virtuous innovation, you need that vessel that serves as the insulator against all the forces that would attack it from without or [within] from fear with this process. And that is Bitcoin, right? We\u2019re creating that! And having said all that, right: adoption, utility, productivity \u2014 those three things create that monetary chemical reaction of sorts. And the last piece is inflation. But inflation is almost just the way that we translate the energy \u2014 it\u2019s a translation coefficient of the energy into a frame of reference of the dimensionality or the domain where I\u2019m spending it. I mean, I\u2019m gonna have to translate my monetary energy into Rubles or Pesos of Dollars or Euros of Yen if I cross into one of those domains, because it\u2019s their world, not our world! So if the Dollar didn\u2019t inflate, then would Bitcoin go up? If the United States had a perfect monetary policy \u2014 no inflation \u2014 could Bitcoin succeed? Yeah! It could succeed! If people adopt it \u2014 because it\u2019s got technical advantages, right? If they adopt it as a reserve asset, I mean their choice is that versus stock versus bonds versus property \u2014 you still have the issue of: How do I commute energy through time and space? So I would still adopt it! Technology will still get better! I mean if there was no inflation you would still like the iPhone. You would still like Zooming to me if there was no inflation! Technology would get better, and we\u2019d have productivity! We\u2019d be inventing stuff: fusion, better materials, etc. And when we created stuff like Zooming and we put together Zoom with YouTube, we would talk, and someone would put it up on YouTube and 100,000 people would see it and 3 people would have an idea and something would happen that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise! You don\u2019t need inflation for Bitcoin to be successful anymore than you need it for Google or Apple or Amazon to be successful \u2014 it just happens that in an inflationary environment it accelerates \u2014 2% inflation will grow it 2% faster, 10% inflation will grow it 10% faster \u2014 in theory if a bond is pure energy and if bonds are inflating at 20%, then that means that Bitcoin will have a 20% real yield in that currency where you see that energy inflation! And it\u2019ll be different relative to the frame of reference of every single domain or every country depending upon how they choose to manage their currency. They could in theory \u2014 I could peg the Dollar, like in Singapore or the UAE I peg to the Dollar. I could peg to gold. If I peg to gold, it\u2019ll be a 3\u20134% differential. If I peg to the Dollar it could be a 10\u201315% differential. If I peg to the Peso it could be a 32% differential. So all of the value of Bitcoin relative to the people in the ecosystems in the domain will vary! And of course, that\u2019s why if I\u2019m in Lebanon or Argentina, this is even more insanely valuable to me than if I\u2019m in Switzerland!"}

You can\u2019t create more of it! If I give this much to you, you can\u2019t wiggle your fingers and make it twice as much! If you lose it, it\u2019s gone! And you can play all these games and thermodynamics \u2014 it\u2019s a great field because everybody thinks \u2014 they\u2019re all looking for that perpetual motion machine. The laws of thermodynamics, we used to paraphrase them at MIT in a snarky way, we\u2019d say, You can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t break even, and you can\u2019t get out of the game! The laws of thermodynamics! It\u2019s like, from a layman\u2019s point of view: You can\u2019t cheat! There is no cheating in thermodynamics! It might look like you got something for nothing \u2014 even Maxwell\u2019s demon. He posed, Maybe I could actually fight or reverse entropy and get order from disorder by dividing a chamber and I have a demon and there\u2019s a little door and molecules are bouncing around, and what if my demon opened the door when the molecule bounced from the right to the left and closed it before the [molecule] bounced from the left to the right? I could over time with randomness get all of the bouncy molecules on one side of the chamber and I could reduce entropy. And they couldn\u2019t figure that out! They called it Maxwell\u2019s demon. Well what\u2019s wrong with that argument? Doesn\u2019t that break the laws of thermodynamics? And the answer came along 100 years later when some IBM computer scientist pointed out that information is building up in the head of the demon, and the information is in and of itself creating entropy, and so no you\u2019re not cheating! Once you actually account for all the information, disorder, and energy in the system, it did respect the laws of thermodynamics! You can\u2019t cheat time. You can\u2019t cheat space. There is ultimately conservation! And Isaac Newton \u2014 all of Newton\u2019s laws: conservation of mass, conservation of energy F = ma, it\u2019s the basis of physics, the basis of mechanics, the basis of every machine we\u2019ve built that works, it\u2019s the basis of all of our heat exchange, and it hasn\u2019t been \u2014I mean scientists and engineers don\u2019t have a high opinion of economists. And one of the reasons why is that it hasn\u2019t been important for economists to understand closed systems, isolated systems, servomechanisms, conservation of mass and energy, E = mc\u23032. E = mc\u23032 matters! What it means is: If there\u2019s mass, it becomes exponentially expensive to move it around. E is the energy! You wanna move stuff fast? You need to take the mass to zero! And that\u2019s how you move stuff fast! So economists, maybe what they were doing didn\u2019t matter before Bitcoin! You could say, maybe Bitcoin is the first time that technology crashed into economics! You have energy, you have technology, you have math crashing into economics and now you couldn\u2019t really be a competent economist without appreciating closed systems, energy efficiency, math, conservation of everything!"}

And Bitcoin in a way maps onto that system very nicely, because it gives us an economic system in which we cannot break the laws. It perfectly respects and aligns itself with the laws of thermodynamics in the economic sphere! And another thing this made me think of was \u2014 this was a framework I got from you on inflation \u2014 was that, CPI is low, but everything you want is inflating rapidly.

{"link": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-5-channeling-monetary-energy-across-time-and-space-92f68a8327ea?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------", "title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "text": "Robert Breedlove [1:30:15]: Alright guys! That was Episode 5 of the Saylor Series and, man! What a big episode! We hit on some major concepts today! I just thought it was super interesting, as always! Mr. Saylor brings the heat! I think first of all we talked about how fiat currency is basically implemented as a means of augmented the portability of gold, because gold is heavy and physical, it\u2019s difficult and expensive to transact it across space, although gold is really good at holding its value across time and has a high relative scarcity. But the point there that Saylor brought up was, Although gold-backed paper currencies were great at moving value across space \u2014 that was their purpose of introduction \u2014 they actually suffer because they have all of these frictions between different regulatory and intermediary environments, such that when you try and move cash from say China to the US, you hit different types of capital controls and whatnot. So it can be very expensive and cumbersome to actually move fiat currency across different jurisdictional domains which actually inhibits its original purpose, which was to increase the portability of money! And I like the analogy he drew with a boat: If you consider that the moving value across space function of money is something like putting goods on a boat and selling it across the sea, he\u2019s saying effectively that gold was dingy\u2014very unlikely to move value across space well, whereas fiat currency might be something more like a wooden ship \u2014 a little bit better at doing that but still not idea, whereas Bitcoin is actually like a steel ship \u2014 it\u2019s an extremely strong protocol and as long as you maintain the steel by painting it it\u2019s basically indestructible. The analogy there being: So long as Bitcoin is maintained by the mining network \u2014 which generates its revenue through the block revenue and the transaction fees \u2014 that essentially makes the monetary network itself self-reinforcing and indestructible in a lot of ways. And then the last analogy is that steel is super repairable! If you weld a steel plate onto the hull of a ship, the weld actually has a higher tensile strength than the original steel itself, which I think again analogizes [to] Bitcoin, is that: It can absorb superior competitive features from the marketplace, so it can actually repair or improve itself in a way that makes it even stronger than its original form. So that was a great analogy! And the other one that I liked that we touched on was the vacuum sealing of food, which if you think about it it\u2019s just a way of restricting the stored energy \u2014 whether it\u2019s food or money \u2014 from contact with entropy of the environment. In the case of vacuum sealing, we\u2019re removing all of the air \u2014 all of the microorganisms that might exist in that air, water, or moisture \u2014 from the package itself, such that none of them can attack the energy content stored therein. And the analogy there being: Getting the entropy or uncertainty out of the monetary channel. We can think of the SHA-256 algorithm as an encrypted vacuum sealing of the monetary energy stored in the Bitcoin network. So it gives it this super-high resistance to impurities or uncertainty or nefarious actors \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even have to be nefarious necessarily depending on your perspective on central banks\u2014but it gets the uncertainty out of your money! So it gives it this energetic vacuum seal, so I thought that was a really cool analogy too. [1:34:38] And we talked about money being power. And that money itself is this superset of all power that humans have been able to create in the world. Again the physics definition for power which I really liked \u2014 because it ties back to the importance of proof of work \u2014 power is the capacity to do work over time. So to be able to apply force over distance over time \u2014 that\u2019s what power actually means. It makes sense that we would generate power, or be able to allocate energy into a power storage network through proof of work. That\u2019s what gold mining was, and that\u2019s what the mining expenditure related to Bitcoin is! So we think of money as this amalgam of all the powers that human beings have had over time and looking at Bitcoin through that lens, we see that the power of the network \u2014 which was another analogy that Saylor used was the voltage in a closed source system \u2014 so the supply of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t move, but the amount of energy stored in the network is the only thing that can be increased! So it\u2019s a perfectly closed system that mass can neither exit or leave, but only energy can be added to it! In that way we can think of the power of the Bitcoin energy network as its price, effectively. We dug in a little bit in that and talked about stock to flow model and Bitcoin supply issuance. It\u2019s not actually the supply that is driving the value necessarily \u2014 as we go into later \u2014 it\u2019s more a function of its utility. Because as Saylor said the impossibility to produce something is not what makes it valuable, it\u2019s actually the impossibility of producing something that already has relevance to someone\u2019s goal-directed action! So value is this subjective quality where if a particular object or even a service or a piece of knowledge is relevant to you accomplishing the aims of your goal-directed action \u2014 if it\u2019s an accelerant for you towards you achieving your goals \u2014 then we can say that thing has value! Even if something is an accelerant towards you achieving your aims \u2014 say like oxygen, we all have the aim of breathing and surviving \u2014 it doesn\u2019t actually have a lot of value because it has no scarcity! So the scarcity can amplify the value, but the value itself is actually a function of the individual good, service, or knowledge\u2019s relevance to your goal-directed action. So we actually put it in these buckets of what actually defines the monetary network value of Bitcoin. And he classified it as: adoption, inflation, utility, [and productivity]. And I loved this quote he used. He said that Bitcoin is, \u201cAn encrypted energy crucible in which we store the energy of life.\u201d So we touched on it repeatedly in this show that money is life force. It\u2019s this meta-energy that allows us to access essentially any other form of energy that\u2019s available in the marketplace. [1:38:08] And in that way we need a system that maps onto the scarcity of the thing that it represents, if that makes sense. So in thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so it makes sense that the money which best maps onto that will become naturally selected in the marketplace! And then we went into another definition of money\u2014and this is one I\u2019ve used several times. I say that, Money is an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future. The ineradicable uncertainty of the future! No matter how much technology advances, we\u2019re never going to get rid of uncertainty! Uncertainty itself by the way is another expression of entropy! We live in a universe pervaded by entropy, and in fact entropy is the only thing that defines the flow of time in the universe. Everything \u2014 often these processes are symmetric \u2014 but the one thing that imparts a directionality to time is this flow of entropy: things left unmaintained becoming increasingly uncertain or breaking down or more chaotic over time. So money, since it gives us pure optionality in the marketplace \u2014 it\u2019s like, no matter what unforeseen consequence we encounter, money is the best tool for dealing with that uncertainty, because it gives us a claim on the collective savings of the world! So we can access whatever it is we may need\u2014assuming it\u2019s available in the marketplace\u2014to resolve that uncertainty when we encounter it. And Saylor made a good caveat to this analogy because he said that one thing about an insurance policy is that it carries a lot of counterparty risk. So even today we\u2019re sitting in 2020 with this global pandemic striking, many insurance policies are not being paid out because it had exclusions for a pandemic or other force majeure I guess they call a lot of them. So we could say that Bitcoin is actually even more valuable than just a standard insurance policy in that it\u2019s a non-counterparty insurance policy! It\u2019s a money that does not have any political exposure to pay out. So if you\u2019re holding cash in a form that can\u2019t be confiscated, inflated, stopped, then no matter what eventuality you encounter or what circumstances you encounter in dealing with the uncertainties of life, you have a pool of pure capital optionality with Bitcoin! And that cannot be said for any other asset! There is no other money that can provide you that degree of assurance! [1:40:53] I mentioned that quote from Carl Schmitt that, Sovereign is he that decides the exception, so this really important because by totally removing counterparty risk from money, Bitcoin has removed all exceptions from money or the monetary policy if you will. And by doing that, you\u2019ve taken away the ability to make exceptions in the game of Bitcoin, so all of a sudden\u2014Sovereign is he who can make the exception \u2014 if no one can make the exception, then no one\u2019s sovereign so there\u2019s no sovereign over participants in the network, which means you\u2019ve maximized the individual sovereignty of all network participants! And this is something that\u2019s really radical! You really have to think about this for a long time! Again we could define sovereignty somewhat simply as just, The authority to act as one sees fit. The ability to conduct an action consistent with your purpose of aims. And Bitcoin\u2019s the only money in history that maximizes our ability to do that! As I argue in one of my latest pieces, Bitcoin is Hope, that Bitcoin is money purpose-built for entrepreneurship. It maximizes not only their sovereignty but also their accountability, and their ability to engage in adventure! To engage in business dealings and taking on risk to try and solve problems for the market and generating value in the process. So I thought that was a really interesting way to look at it. And then we got into debt, and I love the way he described debt as almost an anti-energy, where you\u2019ve actually, instead of having this capital cushion against uncertainty, that debt actually can amplify the negative consequences of encountering uncertainty! Now it can also be used to enhance the positive consequences! That\u2019s what leverage is, that\u2019s what amplifies gains or losses, but it tends to be a poor strategy over time, because the one thing that\u2019s unavoidable in an entropic universe is volatility. It makes positive volatility more beneficial, but it can make negative volatility cause you total destruction. It puts you at risk of ruin, which if you\u2019ve any of Taleb\u2019s work, it\u2019s just the number one thing we all must avoid! We got into some specific examples of how fiat currency \u2014 because it\u2019s depreciating over time and large corporations have access to really cheap loans, it\u2019s actually incentivizing them to take negative treasury positions! To borrow money on the market at low rate and buy back their own stock, because again you would expect that the scarcity of that stock and the performance of the underlying capital tend to outperform the borrowing cost in a market where the cost of borrowing is suppressed by central banks, effectively. [1:44:13] So this puts corporations in a weird position because the incentive structure is such that it\u2019s causing them to fragilize their own business model into \u2014 instead of having a positive buffer against uncertainty in their treasury they\u2019re actually carrying negative treasury balances \u2014 which can make them subject to their creditors! The wishes of their creditors, which again \u2014 Sovereign is he who makes the exceptions. All of a sudden, by marginalizing your own capital position and putting yourself in the hands of creditors you\u2019ve now given away your sovereignty in the world to your creditor, and taken it away from yourself and your shareholders. So I thought that was brilliant as well! And then we went into the politics of currency, and this is another way to look at the importance of Bitcoin is that people for years have talked about getting the money out of politics. If we get the money out of politics that would make for a more fair equitable system, but Bitcoin\u2019s gonna flip that on its head! If you\u2019re getting money out of politics, that would require legislating away human nature somehow which in a way that\u2019s not possible! What we would do instead with Bitcoin is just get the politics out of the money. All of a sudden we have a money that can\u2019t be manipulated or confiscated based on political will. And Saylor\u2019s analogy here is that politics actually toxify the currency. And we could think of Quantitative Easing or monetary inflation is actually like putting a healthy individual on chemotherapy just to enrich the physician \u2014 the physician being the government! The physician is administering this \u201cmedicine\u201d to the patient, but the patient \u2014 being the productive economy \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually need it! Quantitative Easing again is not infusing any new value into the economy, it\u2019s just reallocating it away from those holding the fiat currency as a store of value to those holding assets that inflate: typically real estate, stock, reliably scarce assets. So the other part of that is that over time this analogy holds because like even sugar or drugs like maybe heroin or chemotherapy \u2014 it loses its efficacy over time! So the stimulative effects of fiat currency inflation actually diminish over time as well! And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing today in 2020 is that central banks have pushed all the levers to the metal so to speak and they\u2019re getting very little economic response as a result. And through that biological lens we can consider hyperinflation as being a form of socioeconomic organ failure or a toxic shock where all of a sudden these energy centers\u2014in the form of our institutions or economic networks\u2014the life blood that flows through them in currency has been so diminished in terms of its informational energetic carrying capacity that the institutions start becoming unraveled! People can no longer interoperate between themselves and between these institutions. The trust that maintains the social cohesion is basically diluted along with the currency! I thought that was a great way to look at it as well. And then this \u2014 I just think this is just a wonderful argument \u2014 this next point \u2014 on how to just diffuse anyone\u2019s counterpoint to Bitcoin! Assuming they have a relatively sophisticated understanding of a store of value function\u2014and it\u2019s just a very simple thought experiment: How do you store value effectively for 100 years into the future? How can I store value today in the most lossless way to transmit it 100 years into the future? So we could say, Alright, what\u2019s being used today as a store of value? FAANG stocks or other high-performing equities! They\u2019re being used today \u2014 why not those? So the problem with those is that clearly by owning an equity you\u2019re taking on industry, regulatory, and counterparty risk. There\u2019s not really many equities you could\u2019ve invested in 100 years ago that would still hold their value today! Maybe none actually\u2014I could be wrong on that! But very very few, so you\u2019d have to be the stock picker of the century so to speak for that to work. So you\u2019d say, Ah well let\u2019s look at something like real estate! Real estate also suffers from all of those issues! It does have reliable scarcity but it\u2019s an asset that\u2019s out in the open, it can\u2019t be hidden, in the event of a war or an escalation of property taxes or even just outright confiscation as in the US with Eminent Domain \u2014 your property could just be taken away completely! Even if it worked perfectly, say you\u2019re paying a low property tax rate of 2% a year, you\u2019re still getting cut in half every 35 years! So that\u2019s not a very effective way. So historically the most trust-minimized asset or trustless store of value was gold. But as we covered in the last episode, gold has 2% inflation per year. If you\u2019re trying to circumvent the counterparty risk related to it you need to move it every quarter or every few years. That can be another 25 basis points to 1% per year. So now even looking at gold as the hardest economic store of value historically, you\u2019re talking about getting cut in half every 22\u201335 years, and over a 100-year period you\u2019re approaching a 90% loss of value. You could say fiat currencies \u2014 the US Dollar! The US Dollar is strong today, but I would argue that there\u2019s scarcely a worse choice than that! That is the wealth storage medium that least holds its value over time. I think your best case of holding a fiat currency for 100 years \u2014 at least the past 100 years, say in the US Dollar you\u2019re above 99% total loss of value \u2014 and that\u2019s if you pick the right currency and yours doesn\u2019t hyperinflate or is invaded by another country and deauthorized or whatever it may be. So you\u2019re somewhere between 99%-100% loss of total value in fiat currency. So what does that leave you with? It leaves you with Bitcoin! There\u2019s only one store of value that is totally free of counterparty risk, has a fully diluted or a universally transparent and predictable supply schedule \u2014 so we all know the inflation, there\u2019s zero unexpected inflation \u2014 and it can be stored in any number of ways in these custom, ultra high security custody schemas like multisig and things of that sort! So I think if you just zoom out on the store of value argument, it\u2019s a clear winner! There\u2019s just not even competition! I mean your second best choice is maybe I guess gold or possibly real estate, and you\u2019re still looking at \u2014 say in the case of real estate, if everything went perfectly and you only had your 2% property tax per year, you\u2019re looking at an 87% total loss in 100 years! Whereas Bitcoin you have essentially 0%! It\u2019s not that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have inflation in the system, but the inflation is a fully-diluted cap table if you will. Everybody knows what it is! So you\u2019re playing off of 21 Million even though only 18.5 Million Bitcoin have been issued so far to date. So I thought that was brilliant! A great way to look at it. Zoom out! In the store of value area, Bitcoin is \u2014 undisputed \u2014 the best contender! I mean the one argument against it would be that it\u2019s new! It\u2019s only 12 years old, so how could argue that it\u2019s gonna last for 100 years \u2014 and that just comes down to faith and the existing track record of Bitcoin and the protocol and the math defending it. So it\u2019s not a surefire bet, but assuming Bitcoin continues to function in the same flawless way it has to date then it\u2019s not even a contest! Bitcoin is far and away the best store of value! [1:52:55] So that goes into a discussion about history, and Saylor made the point that the greatest lesson of history was that the most organized group of people win. Clearly, right? We are more than the sum of our parts when we can coordinate our efforts! And again, by getting the politics out of money, Bitcoiners are essentially perfectly aligned! We can compete and fight amongst ourselves and argue and all of these things, but the one thing that doesn\u2019t change, that\u2019s not subject to politics, is 21 Million, no confiscating, only private keys can generate and spend transactions \u2014 these fundamental rules of money that are not subject to politics enhances the cohesion of Bitcoiners, effectively. And so that\u2019s another perspective on why Bitcoin wins! It\u2019s just gonna have a more organized, more disciplined human force behind it! And the way it \u2014 I Tweeted this the other day \u2014 and this gets back to the Sun Tzu thing, Territory is the most decisive factor in determining the outcome of any battle. And as Bitcoiners, the moral, intellectual, and philosophical high ground that we occupy is virtually unassailable! So in my mind that\u2019s why we win! We are operating from a place that is the most protected and gives us the most optionality against all competing systems, and therefore that causes Bitcoin to outcompete all of the other systems over time! That\u2019s just Darwinian. And then going back into the SOV store of value versus medium of exchange argument, Saylor had a brilliant way of describing this, that, Bitcoin\u2019s a high-frequency store of value and a low-frequency medium of exchange! So that every second you\u2019re holding Bitcoin, it\u2019s performing its function! Anyone that\u2019s saying Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have utility, they don\u2019t understand inflation. They don\u2019t understand store of value. Because every second you\u2019re holding Bitcoin and it\u2019s adhering to that fixed and diminishing supply schedule and you\u2019re storing it in a custody model that\u2019s really difficult to confiscate or to corrupt, it\u2019s performing its function! It\u2019s storing your monetary life energy in an encrypted vacuum sealed container! And one of the things he said there was, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin is immortal energy! We\u2019ve never had anything like this! And this too got into how preserving this wealth will impact Bitcoin\u2019s relationship with fiat currency. So Bitcoin \u2014 which is historically yielding about 200% annually \u2014 if you can go out into the market and borrow at 5%, you have an incentive to never sell! You have an incentive to just keep accumulating Bitcoin and borrowing up to these intelligent thresholds, of ideally never being marked to market, and having favorable loan covenants. The incentive is to borrow, and acquire Bitcoin! Again he analogized this to how generational wealth is handled, where a lot of families just own, say, a block of New York City, and they just borrow against it little by little over time. So Saylor\u2019s point is, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin operates as this immortal energy. And the incentives related to Bitcoin are interesting because historically it\u2019s been yielding say 200% annualized return, so if you can go into the marketplace and borrow let\u2019s say 5% or anything below the annualized return, then you actually have an incentive to do so! To actually go out and borrow and acquire more Bitcoin! And more recently \u2014 this was recorded before Saylor\u2019s latest announcement most recently \u2014he actually used Microstrategy\u2019s balance sheet to go out and raise some convertible notes and do this very thing! Where he can borrow at a rate below Bitcoin\u2019s expected annualized return, and he\u2019s using it to acquire additional Bitcoin! And this points toward something really interesting: Pierre Rochard wrote a great piece about this years ago. I think it\u2019s called Speculative Attacks. And so what\u2019s effectively happening is that, since Bitcoin tends to outperform broader investment indices, and since debt and interest rates are being artificially suppressed by central banks, this opens up an attack vector on the fiat currency itself where market activists can go out into the marketplace, borrow fiat, and then actually sell that fiat to acquire Bitcoin! And if you do this at scale, this can actually induce inflationary pressure on the fiat currency undergoing the speculative attack. So this is to say: Saylor\u2019s recent move with the convertible note play is in some ways a speculative attack on the US Dollar! So again it just points towards how the economic principles underpinning money and the incentive schemes related to both fiat currency and Bitcoin sort of all point towards the ultimate success of Bitcoin in the long term! Then we got into the utility of money. It was another one of these factors that drive Bitcoin\u2019s success. And the general point here is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s: Bitcoin is extensible. Meaning, it\u2019s protocol is adaptable. You can add other features to it, you can build businesses on top of it, you can connect APIs to it. There\u2019s a great degree of programmability that Bitcoin enables that something like gold just does not! Gold is this dumb rock that essentially just sits in a vault and provides assurances of supply scarcity, but offers none of the feature sets that Bitcoin enables! And looking at it as technology, we can also say of fiat currency, it suffers because it has these technology backdoors in the form of issuers being able to inflate the supply and steal wealth from everyone else. Whereas something like gold or Bitcoin does not! It has these backdoors closed! And this spins up a number of interesting possibilities with Bitcoin which Saylor went into in a little more detail, but basically, by interfacing this base monetary protocol that we call Bitcoin with digital technology, we now gain a huge degree of customizability and unique ways to channel our will or intent across time and fund it in many unique ways. And you can do this with things like smart contracts that actually mitigate or minimize counterparty risk. Whereas if again you wanted to send flowers to your niece on her birthday every year for 100 years after your death, to do that with something like gold you\u2019d have to put all your trust in a custodian and some type of payment mechanism to get to the flower delivery guy, and then the flower delivery business itself you\u2019d have to bet on one that was gonna stay in business! Whereas with something like Bitcoin you can actually write a lot of these things into the code or into the smart contract that can go into the marketplace and search for say a good payment service to deliver the payment, a good flower delivery service. So it gives you a much higher degree of adaptivity and resiliency and projecting your will and intentions beyond the grave if you will, so super interesting way to look at Bitcoin. And then he touched on another aspect of Bitcoin that really drives its valuation, and he was referring to the productivity of the Bitcoin network participants themselves. So when market actors \u2014 whether they\u2019re individual, corporate, or government \u2014 have decided to go long Bitcoin, they\u2019re making a similar decision to what Saylor did, where they\u2019re deciding to use Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, or said differently, just to hold it on balance sheet as a means of storing wealth. And what this does is that this is a two-phased approach because the initial phase is, Hey, I\u2019m putting my treasury into Bitcoin. I\u2019m selling the cash and buying Bitcoin. But the second-order effect of that is, once you\u2019ve made that decision, you as a productive and effective entrepreneur are going to continue sweeping profits or excess cash flow into your treasury over time! So not only is the value accreted to the Bitcoin network \u2014 it\u2019s not even that initial slug of capital in the form of the treasury transaction \u2014 but also the discounted future expected cash flows from future sweeps into that same treasury! And I think this is an incredibly way of looking at it, because I\u2019ve never seen anyone in Bitcoin that studies it closely that becomes bullish \u2014 that ever becomes less bullish! So it\u2019s almost like once you\u2019re allocating capital in and you\u2019re studying it more closely and you see all of these things we\u2019ve covered in depth and more things we will cover on how significant of a monetary innovation this really is, and it just causes you to escalate your allocation into your treasury. Maybe 20% of your treasury initially and creeping up to 30, 40, 50%! And this is all just a self-reinforcing feedback loop, because every decision you make to increase your allocation of Bitcoin is putting game theoretic pressure on all other market participants to do the same! It\u2019s a game of frontrunning or taking as much territory on the network as possible! So this has a really interesting effect of intertwining the fate of Bitcoiners together in a way that \u2014 it\u2019s like a compounding incentive structure that incentivizes us not only to become more productive to generate even more free cash flow to put into this superior savings technology, but it also incentivizes us as HODLers to want to educate others! We want to describe to the rest of the world \u2014 not only for financial purposes but also for moral purposes \u2014 how the existing system is rigged! And you are being robbed! And this is not only pragmatically the best system but also philosophically the best system for savings the world\u2019s ever had! And even evangelize! Once you\u2019re a Bitcoin HODLer and you\u2019ve found this way of saving your own wealth \u2014 your own life energy \u2014 in an uncompromisable medium across time, you want the same for others! The natural human proclivity towards helping one another I think comes to the surface in that you want others to succeed in the same way because why would you want anything else? Actually\u2014other people succeeding in true free market economic competition \u2014 it\u2019s a positive sum game! Every time someone\u2019s doing something better, faster, cheaper, that solution they\u2019re providing accretes to all of us! So Bitcoin really\u2014not only does it intertwine all of the fates of its network or market participants, but it\u2019s also encouraging all of us to think differently and communicate differently! Versus a fiat currency paradigm which is much more zero-sum\u2014much more rent seeking focused. So on this topic of Bitcoin as an American \u2014 in the idea sense \u2014 technology, Saylor had this great quote that, A crucible of virtuous innovation requires a vacuum insulation layer. Again, to preserve the wealth whether that\u2019s the productivity, the energy generated, the profits, the cash flows of any entity requires an insulating layer of some kind! Otherwise the entropy of nature \u2014 whether it\u2019s the greed of man or the uncertainty of nature or the taxes of moving capital from one jurisdiction to another \u2014 they just eat up that wealth itself! So again we\u2019re back to Bitcoin being the ultimate vacuum sealing of capital we\u2019ve ever had! We got into inflation a bit and the one thing I really wanted to point out here is that contrary to what Bitcoin is \u2014 this virtuous feedback loop of incentives and game theory \u2014 fiat currency is actually the reverse! So not only is inflation theft \u2014 it\u2019s eroding real wealth through fiat currency supply inflation, but there\u2019s also a psychological element to it as well! If inflation is growing, market actors are smart! They start to attempt to frontrun future inflation, so actually inflation expectations tend to outpace actual inflation in a nonlinear fashion! So inflation\u2019s coming in at 2, 3, 4, 5%. If it\u2019s growing, people expect it to continue growing and they\u2019ll actually start selling their fiat today in anticipation of further fiat currency inflation in the future. And if you sell fiat currency, you\u2019re inducing further inflationary pressure on it. You\u2019re actually increasing the velocity of money itself. It becomes this game of hot potatoes \u2014 you don\u2019t want to hold the dollars. And this can add fuel to that vicious cycle that ultimately culminates in hyperinflation. Again that\u2019s just the precise opposite of Bitcoin\u2019s quantitative hardening technology \u2014 it\u2019s disinflating over time, causing it to appreciate! And finally we got into one of the topics I like to talk about a lot which I think is eternally mystifying \u2014 is this concept of truth! Saylor presented it in a way I never heard before in that he said, Conservative energy is truth. Meaning that: Whatever strategy or organism or organization best adheres to the first law of thermodynamics and optimizing its inflows and outflows of energy or money or anything else \u2014 that\u2019s how you succeed! You wanna maximize your cash inflows, minimize your cash outflows, for instance, to be a successful organization. In that context Bitcoin is the first conservative monetary network in history! We could say gold was one \u2014 it was the most conservative monetary network in history \u2014 but Bitcoin\u2019s the first one that maps perfectly onto thermodynamics! As Saylor said sort of jokingly how they talked about thermodynamics at MIT in that, You can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t break even, and you can\u2019t escape the game \u2014 Bitcoin maps onto that really well! You can\u2019t manipulate 21 Million, you must incur transaction fees \u2014 so you can\u2019t really break even \u2014 and you can\u2019t ignore the game! You can\u2019t escape the game of Bitcoin! It just imposes its rules on everything! So that was it! I think it was a great episode! He concluded with saying that perhaps Bitcoin is actually the first instance of technology crashing into economics, so possibly it\u2019ll cause a rewriting of history books, which I\u2019ve intuited it would! More so in the sphere of say capitalism versus socialism, but we may actually see economics become more focused on these physical principles of say energy and everything that we discussed today \u2014 thermodynamics and things like that. And actually the new book by Saifedean \u2014 he\u2019s writing a book called Principles of Economics, and it goes into energy! Which is not something that you typically see in economics textbooks, so he might be right at the cutting edge of something really important! That was Episode 5, I hope you can tell things are heating up at this point! We spent a lot of time building this foundation and now I think you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of that. Things are only going to get more interesting in future episodes. Thanks for listening, and we\u2019ll see you soon!"}

Welcome back to Episode 4 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! We\u2019re coming back today with part 4 of the Saylor Series! And this is the first part of Day 2! So Saylor and I spent 2 days recording, we did about 10.5 hours in total, so Episode 4 represents the first episode in Day 2. And if you haven\u2019t seen episodes 1\u20133 yet I highly recommend you go and check those out! We built a lot of foundational material there that just gets referenced back to going forward, so I think it\u2019s really important! In Episodes 1\u20133 we covered the Stone Ages, the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we went forward into the Steel and the Industrial Age. And now, today, we\u2019re getting into the good stuff! Bitcoin theory, the Digital Age, how money and economics is changing once again based on these new and radical innovations in the world today. So today we\u2019re gonna learn about how Bitcoin is the first true digital monetary system in world history! We\u2019re also gonna get Saylor\u2019s answer to that all-important question: What is money? And he has a really good answer I think you\u2019re gonna dig! And we\u2019re gonna get into a bit of the economic principles underlying commodities and their use as money, and why commodities make a really bad form of money, actually. Saylor lays out a really good case for the commodity money kind of being a self-defeating endeavor. And then finally, we\u2019re gonna start looking at Bitcoin as the ultimate means of wealth settlement and preservation. As Saylor refers to it \u2014 it is the first closed loop or closed source energy system we\u2019ve ever had! So I don\u2019t want to spoil anything! This episode\u2019s really good! For me this when a lot of the light bulbs started to go off and started to have a lot of those little, mini epiphanies during our conversation, which you might see me having as we engage. So I hope you like this! It\u2019s a really good episode. See you again soon!"}

We\u2019ve tried others, they just didn\u2019t work! This is the first one that\u2019s perfected, that\u2019s functioning! It\u2019s the first one to cross $100 Billion in market cap and now it\u2019s about $200 Billion in market cap. $200 Billion means $200 Billion of monetary energy, and if I look at all of the great digital networks \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 when they cross $100 Billion of monetary energy, then that\u2019s a legitimizing step! Generally when they get there, 95% or more of the investing community doesn\u2019t believe in them! Sometimes 99% doesn\u2019t believe in them! But they\u2019re too big to fail \u2014 they\u2019re fires that have been unleashed into the society, and they\u2019re burning, and the effect is exothermal. What we have in each of these networks is: we have the collapse, a dematerialization of some product or service or virtue or some ineffable quality be it friendship or mobile devices or information. It\u2019s collapsing into a lower energy state. And as it collapses into a lower energy state, huge amounts of energy in the form of profit, cash flow, and value get given off! Apple can ship a better camera to a billion people overnight for a nickel! Facebook can improve the way that you communicate to your loved ones overnight for a nickel! And Google can package the Library of Alexandria in the palm of your hand and ship it to a billion people overnight for a nickel! And when you have these massive dematerializations of value and they get on a network with a network effect, it\u2019s almost like \u2014 well you see a crystallizing structure where you\u2019ve got an amorphous substance and as it crystallizes we go from steam to water to ice! Collapses, gives off energy. And what Bitcoin is, is it\u2019s that first digital monetary network, digital monetary system. It\u2019s collapsing into a much more efficient form, it\u2019s giving off energy! And that just brings us back to that entire subject of: how important is energy to the human race!"}

So it\u2019s like all that energy is being reallocated to I guess changing the molecular structure for the next state. Then the temperature starts to increase again as it goes into water, and then it flatlines again before going into steam. So I guess what you\u2019re getting at is that energy becomes transmuted into the next state before it can start to give off energy in the form of profit, productivity \u2014 it\u2019s giving back economic substance to its users. And I think that\u2019s sort of the analogy you\u2019re drawing there?"}

Or when it leaps from fiat to Bitcoin! There\u2019s this phase transition, and we see it throughout all areas of science, but right now this is just the first time in human history that we see this creation of pure digital monetary network! And I want to replace monetary network with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! And money is energy! In fact, money is the highest form of energy! So if we ask the question, What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. So if I look back through time, human beings as a species prosper by channeling energy. And when we mastered fire, we channeled chemical energy. And when we mastered missiles we channel kinetic energy. And when we master water and hydraulics, we\u2019re actually channeling gravitational energy. The idea of an aqueduct is, well, I\u2019m using gravity to move water 70 miles! Or I\u2019m running a water wheel, or I\u2019m floating a 2-ton block in the water and the gravity\u2019s pushing down on the water and the water is pushing up! And when I dam a stream and I generate hydro energy, well that\u2019s gravity being converted into energy. But if I dam the stream to divert a bunch of fish into my pond, I\u2019m still using gravity! Now, I can channel gravity by dumping a bunch of rocks on your head, but it\u2019s not nearly so easy to create a river of rocks as it is to just tap into a river of water! And so the mastery of fire and water is the mastery of chemical energy, gravitational energy, eventually thermal energy, and the modern era morphed into the mastery of electrical energy and atomic energy. And of course there\u2019s conservation of energy, and when we look at all of these energy networks, I mean look \u2014 100 guys with bows and arrows are an energy network! I\u2019m moving kinetic energy from this side of the battlefield to that side of the battlefield! And a civilization at the mouth of a river with cities up and down the river is sitting on an energy network, just like the Aegean, and the Greek civilization was sitting at the middle of an energy network and they were using gravitational energy. And wind energy \u2014 another form of energy between sails and gravity \u2014 I\u2019m taking advantage of these energies! So the theme is: humans prosper by channeling energy. Now, what\u2019s the most efficient energy network in the history of the world? Well it\u2019s about to be Bitcoin! Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain? And by domain I mean perhaps governmental domain \u2014 like how do I move my energy from New York to Tokyo? And this becomes an interesting question! Let\u2019s take a typical power grid: well I generate power, I channel chemical energy into electrical energy, I lose like 35% of the energy in the coal or in the fossil fuel. When it gets onto the grid, I move it over a high voltage line, and I can move it up to about 500 miles and I lose 2% of the energy. Now it has to get stepped down to 240 volts or lower voltage even, to get into your house. As the voltage steps down, I lose more energy \u2014 it\u2019s about a 4% loss. If I had pure energy at the power plant, I\u2019m gonna lose 6% of the energy to put it into your house 250 miles away! I can\u2019t send 2,000 miles away \u2014 I just can\u2019t I can\u2019t send it 10,000 miles away \u2014 energy will not move from New York to Tokyo. But I can New York to Schenectady! Now when it gets into your house, you have to use it immediately! You can\u2019t store it! So let\u2019s say I wanted to store it \u2014 I need a battery! Well the absence of a battery prevents a mechanism. The mobile wave is a function of Lithium ion batteries in the palm of your hand \u2014 no Lithium ion battery, no smart phone! Now we\u2019re working with modern batteries. Tesla: it\u2019s all about the battery, right? And Elon Musk has really driven battery technology! So let\u2019s say I put a battery in your house. And you pull energy into your house. Well you\u2019ve lose 6%! Now a typical battery \u2014 a good one \u2014 is gonna lose 2% per month! Okay, that means you\u2019re gonna lose 24% of your energy a year! Well what does that sound like? It sounds like 24% inflation a year! It sounds like hyperinflation \u2014 it could get worse, right? Hyperinflation is 100% inflation a year! Let\u2019s say that I have a battery which loses 20% of my power a year, well my half-life on my energy that I pulled off the plant is 3.5 years in 10 years! I\u2019m down to 12.5% of my energy! So the entire civilization is based upon electric power grids and networks, and yet it\u2019s not that good! I mean you really can\u2019t store that much power! Anybody that ever put their computer, they charged it and left the computer for a month or 2 months and you whipped it open, it\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s drained!"}

And I think this is important too to tie this back to money, is that gold itself \u2014 to your point \u2014 was an energy network! Whatever productivity couldn\u2019t be allocated towards something more economic, we would go and mine gold, such that gold became this claim on savings of humanity\u2014which is what money is. And those savings themselves are the result of all our collective energy utilization up until that point. We\u2019ve been transitioning energy into capital, and then gold, or money, becomes the network that commands that capital, and then what I think is interesting too is that the scarcity of the gold actually reflects the scarcity of the energy. So it maps onto it in a way."}

And now let\u2019s play a thought experiment: let\u2019s take our $100 Million worth of monetary energy and let\u2019s put it in a power network that runs on copper, and then let\u2019s put it into a gold network! If I put it into a copper energy network, I have 24% bleed rate per year by the time it gets to the battery. I lose 6%, and I can\u2019t get it more than 500 miles. Okay, so it\u2019s a very short term, short duration, here and now energy network. Let\u2019s put it into a gold network: I put $100 Million into gold. Now I can move that $100 Million of gold 100 miles \u2014 would I lose 6%? Probably not 6%! I could probably move $100 Million of gold 100 miles for $10,000-$100,000 depending on how much security I need! So we\u2019re talking about 10 basis points, instead of 600 basis points of loss. 10 basis points! So gold is a more efficient way to move large amounts of energy for short distances. What if I want to move $100 Million of gold 10,000 miles? Well, that\u2019s about 3,000 lbs of gold, 1.5 tons. So I put it on a global express, it costs $10,000 an hour, I put some dudes with guns on it, I fly 16\u201318 hours around the world \u2014 that\u2019s about $180,000 plus another $70,000. $250,000. If I have to fly the plane back \u2014 let\u2019s just assume I don\u2019t! It\u2019s $250,000, so now we\u2019re up to like 25 basis points. 0.25% is the cost to move it around the world once! Okay? So that\u2019s okay. Now what if I want to deliver $100 Million of gold 100 years into the future? What if I wanted to deliver $100 Million of energy 100 years into the future on copper and batteries? Well my half-life is at 24% at 2% bleed a month. My half-life is 3.5 years. It\u2019s gone completely! And everybody with any common sense knows if you put your laptop charged in your attic for 100 years, it will not be charged in 100 years! You cannot store electricity on a copper network or a Lithium ion battery, it\u2019s no good! I put it in gold, put it in a vault. So let\u2019s say I put it in a vault in J.P. Morgan in 1900 in the United States of America. And the United States is the most successful country in the 20th century: we win every war, and J.P. Morgan remains as a bank and the vault in New York remains. In that case, assuming a 2% mining rate, assuming a stock to flow of 50 and miners mine 2% more gold a year, the half-life of a gold battery is 35 years. I go from $100 Million to $50 Million in 35 years, to $25 Million in 70 years. So about $12.5 Million in 100 years! So I\u2019ve depleted my gold battery 87% if the United States wins every war, and if J.P. Morgan isn\u2019t a corrupt institution and doesn\u2019t fail, and if no one drops a nuclear bomb on New York City! If those things don\u2019t happen then I will get 12% of my money back!"}

We have a gold network and we want to move money, so I put $100 Million in gold and I want to move it around \u2014 well it\u2019s 25 basis points every time I want to move it around. If I want to move it once a quarter, it\u2019s 1% bleed a year if I move it once a quarter. If I mine it it\u2019s 2% bleed a year. That gets me to 3% bleed a year. Divide that into 70 and every 22 years \u2014 that\u2019s the half-life of gold. Energy on a gold network has a half-life of 22 years at best! When you throw in the counterparty risk and the need to move it around \u2014 let\u2019s just assume that we move it around so you don\u2019t lose it! You\u2019re just down to now the issue of technology and commodity risk. And this is an important point: gold is the king of commodities! Gold is the greatest of all human commodities! But my first job at DuPont was I built computer simulations of commodities and specialty chemical networks, and let me tell you what people in that business think: they think commodity is a dirty word! The first thing I learned is: commodity is awful! Nobody wants to be in a commodity business! And here\u2019s the reason commodities are awful: if I actually create a factory that creates a commodity, say, gasoline \u2014 the only thing it can do is create gasoline! If I invest $10 Billion into gasoline refinery, my fixed cost are $10 Billion. The ideal, rational price for me to make a profit? Probably at $4 a gallon? But my variable cost is $1.50 a gallon, because I\u2019ve got all these billions of dollars in the factory! What happens is, when I create commodity refineries, when the price below the profitable point, I will still keep running the factory, because I\u2019ve got a variable margin. I\u2019m generating cash flow even though I\u2019m driving the price down for everybody else in the business. So it\u2019s possible in the commodity business for every single producer to be losing money! And for them to all be acting irrationally, and they\u2019re all pumping out the commodity be it silver \u2014 if you\u2019re a gold miner, what can you do other than mine gold? Once I\u2019ve gone and I\u2019ve invested $100 Billion in mining gold, if the price of gold is cut in half, but my variable cost is $400 an ounce and it\u2019s $800 an ounce, I\u2019m mining gold and selling it at $800 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $700 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $600! When it gets to $500, I\u2019m selling it because the market is not rational \u2014 I can\u2019t transmute my $100 Billion of gold mining capital into Google stock!"}

Maybe a certain government wants to mine gold! Maybe I can\u2019t legally stop even if I wanted to stop! So when you have a commodity business where people have specialized capital and they make those investments, what happens over time everywhere in every industry in every commodity in the history of the world is: the producers overproduce the commodity because, in the phrase of Hotel California, You can check in anytime you want, but you can\u2019t ever leave! It\u2019s a one-way route! You go in, you can\u2019t get out! So that takes us to this real issue of gold, or the real risk of gold, which is: gold prices goes up by a factor of 10, capital gets attracted into commodity production. It\u2019s a feedback: people produce more, gold price goes down, people keep producing to try to recover their cash flows, lots of intelligent people become desperate. When men are desperate, they invent new techniques to produce more gold. They keep producing because they don\u2019t have a choice! They will produce down until the variable cost equals the price, then they will keep producing below variable cost, because it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re in a situation where they can lay off \u2014 for example: a government that takes ownership of a gold mine will produce below variable cost in order to maintain jobs."}

If you\u2019re Singapore and you turn off the airlines because they\u2019re not profitable, you turned off your bridge to the world! The politicians will run the airline below variable cost. If I want to keep jobs \u2014 and how many countries want to project jobs \u2014 if I want to project jobs, I will produce something and sell it below the variable cost. We do that with anything that is politically charged! When a government decides: education, healthcare, transportation, automobiles, local manufacturing, security, defense \u2014 defense is a great example of something that we produce whether we like it or not at a cost that\u2019s higher than potentially the value and use of it!

It takes us back to why Marjorie Merriweather Post was the richest woman in the world! Because Post cereal was starch was stable in a box for a year! Stability at room temperature! Like, Coca-Cola is stable at room temperature in a can. And gold is stable energy! So yeah it\u2019s energy but nonetheless it\u2019s a commodity, and you know what they call a business when it\u2019s been totally wrecked? They call it commoditized! [inaudible] And so every businessperson forever has always strived to avoid being commoditized! That\u2019s the origin of branding, right? We branded sugar water, we branded Gucci bags, we branded everything. We patent things, we brand things, because we want to avoid the inevitable result! The result is: as soon as something is commoditized and open to the public and anybody can produce it, its value goes to the variable cost of production and then it goes below! For example, Apple Computer \u2014 worth $2 Trillion today \u2014 Google, worth more than a Trillion, Facebook. These are valuable networks! But are they the most valuable networks? No! They\u2019re not the most valuable networks to humanity \u2014 they\u2019re the most valuable non-commoditized networks! Because if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on Google, it\u2019s inconvenient. But if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on the power company, it\u2019s deadly! If I cut off your power and your water or even turn off the bridge \u2014 people die! If I turn off Google, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 nobody in New York City\u2019s going to die, right? And so people forget this! And this is the danger of putting all your wealth, of storing your wealth in Apple stock! The world thinks Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 Big Tech \u2014 they\u2019re a store of value! And post-pandemic, everybody surged into the NASDAQ five, and the NASDAQ, because of Big Tech equity \u2014 this is a store of value! I\u2019ll be safe here! We\u2019ll you\u2019ll be safe there for a year, or two years, but you know, General Electric and General Motors and Standard Oil were once, they were the most important networks on Earth, and they changed humanity a lot more than Google, Apple, and Facebook did! And you want to change your life? Try to go a week without electricity and see if there aren\u2019t riots, murders, mayhem! So people don\u2019t ask the question, Why is it that I get my electricity for nothing? Why do I get my water for nothing? Because you try to go 3 days without water, 3 days without electricity, you see what that\u2019s like! And the answer is: because those two things got declared as public utilities \u2014 that they\u2019re so important that nobody have a monopoly on it! As soon as Standard Oil became so instrumental that it changed the Western world, politicians got interested in Standard Oil! And if your power company said, We just decided to jack the cost of electricity by a factor of 10. Would you pay it? Sure you\u2019d pay it, right? Would you complain? Who would you complain to? A politician, right? So we\u2019ve got these networks, they\u2019re really important! But eventually if they\u2019re important enough, they become commodity networks. And so that\u2019s an interesting characteristic. The reason that gold doesn\u2019t work over time is \u2014 we have two examples. It doesn\u2019t work over time because people produce 2\u20133% more of it every year, and over 100 years that means you lose 90% of your energy. It doesn\u2019t work over time because there\u2019s counterparty risks, and the Polish bank, through no fault of their own, got overrun by the Nazis in World War II, and Beijing bank got overrun by first one regime then another regime then a third regime! So that\u2019s another reason it doesn\u2019t work! And a third reason it doesn\u2019t work is if the people become threatened by the network \u2014 so for example 1933, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt found gold to be inconvenient \u2014 if the people become threatened, they complain to the politicians. The politicians might go ahead and take action, and in this case, the reason they were able to take action is because all the gold was sitting in the same place! So if the gold\u2019s sitting in a vault and we know where it is, and it\u2019s under the control of institutions, the institutions are under control of government and therefore that heightens the counterparty risk because of the centralized nature of gold. So the best case for a gold network is you\u2019re gonna lose 90% of your energy over 100 years! But the likely case is you\u2019re gonna lose 95%-98% of your energy over 100 years. And if we look at Nicholas Taleb\u2019s range of outcomes, if you take the 100 biggest cities in the world and you put your gold in the best bank in any of the hundred cities in the world, it looks like in 95\u201396 of them or maybe 99 of them, you lost all your money! You lost all your gold!"}

Because it is so heavy and hard to transact \u2014 compared to Bitcoin, that\u2019s non-corporeal, it can be transmitted at the speed of light \u2014 because gold is so heavy to settle, that that leads to its centralization in bank vaults, and that becomes the ultimate honey pot for politicians and governments, frankly! And the other attack vector we didn\u2019t discuss is that temptation is always given into! As soon as things get dicey, governments immediately monopolize that gold energy network, which is the most important in the world!"}

Every good technology is smarter, faster, stronger! Every technology! Smarter, faster, stronger! So coming to digital gold versus gold: physical gold is not fast enough! How fast is it? If I wanted to move $100 Million of gold, as we talked about, it\u2019s gonna cost me $250,000. So that\u2019s an impedance! But how long is that gonna take you? A week? A month? Somewhere between \u2014 you wanna move 3,000 lbs of gold from New York? I\u2019ve got a month I\u2019m guessing, if you want to get all the protocols set up. So you\u2019re talking about a quarter-million dollars and a month to move the gold. Assuming I needed another custodian and I used Bitcoin, and I wanted to move $100 Million to Bitcoin \u2014 and this is where Bitcoin critics are just utterly wrong and missing the point! \u2014 they all think, Oh, well it takes 30 minutes and $5 to move Bitcoin! And they\u2019re comparing it to a new crypto network that has no value on it! And they\u2019re saying, I can find a way to move it in 5 minutes for a nickel \u2014 but that\u2019s not the point! The appropriate comparison is to gold! How long would it take to move $100 Million of gold? Because there\u2019s $250 Trillion in assets in the alt-assets! And there\u2019s only $25 Billion of real assets in the altcoins or the alt-cryptos. So how long does it take me to move the $250 Trillion around? And when you think about that you realize that Bitcoin would move it in 30 minutes instead of 30 days. Okay? That\u2019s 1,440x as fast! A thousand times as fast a minute versus 1,440 minutes in a day. And so it\u2019s a thousand times as fast, but then it\u2019s $5 versus $250,000! So that\u2019s 50,000x cheaper! So now we\u2019ve got people saying, Oh well it\u2019s very energy efficient \u2014 blah blah blah! Well it\u2019s not, really! It\u2019s inefficient in the way that it\u2019s inefficient to create an electro high speed transit system, a mass-transit system. It was expensive to build the mass-transit system, it got really really cheap to move onto the rails! If you look at the history of railroads, the biggest thing in the 19th century was railroads. It was pretty expensive to create the railroads! It became really cheap to move on the rails! So what we do is we\u2019ve created crypto rails in order to make it 50,000x cheaper to move! But it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s 50,000x cheaper, it\u2019s that it\u2019s 1,000x faster and 50,000x cheaper, and then when you start to multiply 1,000 x 50,000, and you realize \u2014 it starts to be 50,000,000x faster, and then you start to add that third dimension, which is maybe a computer that thinks about this while you\u2019re sleeping 18,000 times, and you realize eventually you get to 50,000,000,000x faster! And now we\u2019ve got to a new engineering or new scientific metaphor which is: superconducting networks! There\u2019s impedance going through an electric power network and you\u2019re losing it, so the solution is that I need to get this superconducted! So I gotta cool the network down to close to near-zero, and it\u2019s expensive! And the point is: Yeah! It\u2019s expensive to get to near-zero, and then the impedance disappears in the network and the friction goes away! And what could you do if the friction went completely away?"}

You could think about when you encrypt monetary energy on the Bitcoin network, it\u2019s like achieving escape velocity out of the gravity well! What we\u2019ve done \u2014 we paid a price to get out of the gravity well. Throw a baseball on a baseball field, it goes a couple of hundred feet. Get out of the gravity well, throw the baseball, it\u2019ll go around the Earth forever! So how much more distance do you get out of the baseball if you pay the price of getting out of the gravity well? It\u2019s not like 10x better, it\u2019s not 100x better, it\u2019s not 1,000,000x better, it goes to infinity, and it never stops! And that\u2019s the breakthrough that people don\u2019t get, it\u2019s like, What can I do if I had vacuum, and I was rid of friction? And yeah there\u2019s a price to pay! And that\u2019s your phase change and your state change, and that\u2019s why I would say: Bitcoin is the most efficient system for channeling energy through time and space in the history of mankind! We\u2019ve never figured out how to channel energy with no impedance and channel energy with no loss! But let\u2019s come back to the outer space analogy: take your flashlight and shine it in your basement. Take your flashlight and shine it on your baseball field. Now get into outer space and take your flashlight and shine it, or flip it the other way: the Hubble telescope! How much better are the photos you get from the Hubble telescope than the photos you get from a telescope that has to shoot through the atmosphere?"}

It\u2019s something that\u2019s just altogether unique and we\u2019ve just never had it before! If you now conceptualize that and you go through your thought experiment, you realize: we need a monetary system, and our monetary system\u2014the three in front of our face are, let\u2019s take it\u2014fiat is a monetary system, gold is a monetary system, Bitcoin is a monetary system. If I put my $100 Million of monetary energy \u2014 I have energy. I take energy, I sell it on the grid, you give me money! I take my money, I put it into the US dollar bank \u2014 it\u2019s in fiat. I wait 100 years, and it\u2019s 7\u20138% asset inflation rate, I have a half-life of 10 years, so I get cut in half 10 times! Okay? $100 Million\u2026$50 Million\u2026$25 Million\u2026$12 Million \u2014 it\u2019s gonna get painful!\u2026$6 Million\u2026$3 Million\u2026I only cut in half 5 times!\u2026$1.5 Million\u2026that\u2019s 6 times, now it gets really painful!\u202670 basis points\u202635 basis points\u202617 basis points\u20268 basis points! By the way, 8 basis points if you don\u2019t get hyperinflation! 8 basis points if your nation wins every war! So we\u2019re not even \u2014 what to say is: you\u2019re losing 99% of your energy. 99% of your energy is being charitable! Now let\u2019s generate $100 Million worth of electricity by burning coal or nuclear power or peddling on my flywheel or rowing on my row machine \u2014 however you got to it \u2014 windmills! Let\u2019s sell it to the grid, take the $100 Million, and let\u2019s to go J.P. Morgan and let\u2019s buy $100 Million worth of gold and let\u2019s have them custodian for me. Put it in their vault \u2014 I guess I could just take it with me, it\u2019s 3,000 lbs! It\u2019s $2,000 an ounce, or whatever the number is! Okay so 1.5 tons \u2014 no! I gotta put it in a vault, right? So I put it in a vault and I pay for custody fees and going in there\u2019s a fee, and then I\u2019m paying, whatever, 20, 30, 40 basis points a year to keep it, and then the miners are out there doing their mining thing and it\u2019s probably 200 basis points worth of additional gold. So that\u2019s 250 basis points a year. And if I watch it and assuming it\u2019s just a dead rock and it\u2019s heavy, I\u2019m not moving it \u2014 I\u2019m doing nothing with it, I\u2019m just staring at it \u2014 then I\u2019ve just gotta add on the counterparty risk and then the fracking risk, or the technology risk. The fracking risk is \u2014 academics always opine about shortages. Academics have been saying there\u2019s an oil shortage, and energy shortage coming! They\u2019ve been saying it since the Club of Rome in 1973 or something! They said it in the \u201950s, \u201960s, \u201970s, \u201980s, and \u201990s, and the world always predicted that we were gonna run out of oil or energy in about 10 years. I studied this at MIT \u2014 I created computer simulations about it. There\u2019s an entire school of thought \u2014 system dynamics \u2014 that studies these things. And the flaw in the reasoning is: it\u2019s a linear interpretation of the world instead of a closed feedback or a non-linear interpretation of the world. The linear interpretation of the world is: we\u2019ve got 10 years worth of oil because that\u2019s what our main proven reserves are! The closed loop interpretation of the world is: when we actually get to 5 years worth of reserves, people start looking for more reserves! And so, no company wants to carry on their balance sheet more than about 10 years worth. And then they just keep finding more, but they don\u2019t publish it. We\u2019re not factoring in human will to live, human ingenuity! People have a tendency that when you tell them they\u2019re about to run out of something, they reprioritize, they think a little bit harder, and they come up with an innovative solution! So that\u2019s what happened with fracking. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil, we had a crisis, and eventually the price of oil went high enough. The people sat down and said, You know? If we invent a new chemistry, and if we raised some capital, we can go ahead and implement fracking, and we doubled the amount of oil! And we did it fast! We had 5 Million barrels a day for like 40 years and that was conventional wisdom and everybody thought, That\u2019s it! And then we went the next year to 6 Million, the next year to 7 Million, the next year to 8 Million, the next year to 9 Million, the next year to 10 Million! And I watched it happen, and I watched all of the big investment bankers \u2014 J.P. Morgan and the like \u2014 they went and they raised billions of dollars from investors and they invested in these fracking companies, in Chesapeake Energy and all these others popped up, and we were awash with oil! And the next thing you read is that we have too much oil! Because it\u2019s a commodity! Because if you put $100 Billion into anything, you invent something new! So for you to be a \u2014 this is why being a cynic and being a pessimist about technology is generally a losing trade, because you\u2019re assuming that human beings won\u2019t invent anything new and have no capability to do it different!"}

And 99% of the population generally will just tell you why it\u2019s impossible and be cynical and be critical and they\u2019re fearful. And the 1% will say, I think I\u2019ll just go try it! And of course the 1% is generally right! I mean, they\u2019re wrong until they\u2019re right! The technology fails until it succeeds. But if they just keep trying, the likelihood that you\u2019ll invent electricity or airplanes or antibiotics or better techniques for agriculture or mobile phones or YouTube\u2014the likelihood is high! It is highly likely that someone in the future will come up with a way to extract all the energy that you\u2019re ever gonna need from some element the size of a sugar cube. We don\u2019t have it yet, and I can probably find a million conventional thinkers that\u2019ll tell us why it\u2019s impossible. The same guys that told John Harrison he couldn\u2019t discover longitude with a clock, and the same guys that told the Wright brothers they couldn\u2019t fly! It would be those same guys\u2014and they\u2019ll be right until they\u2019re wrong! And in this particular case, that\u2019s a good thing! That\u2019s a good thing if what you want is abundance. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s a crippling intellectual mistake to run a monetary standard on a commodity that can be produced by man! Ultimately, you have to run a monetary system on math, right? As you pointed out before \u2014 mathematical money \u2014 because 2 + 2 = 4, and as long as 2 + 2 = 4, human ingenuity is not the enemy! And this is a basic sociological principle, really, which is: do you want to design a system assuming that people are stupid and will not evolve and cannot defeat it? Or do you want to design a system assuming people are smart and channel the energy of human ingenuity into making the system work better? And this is why gold is defective! And why a decentralized crypto network of which Bitcoin is the most successful in the history of the world \u2014 that\u2019s why it is effective, because Bitcoin is channeling human ingenuity into making it better! And every commodity is channeling human ingenuity into making it worse, as a money! So if we come back to this idea, Bitcoin is the ultimate energy network! Well we\u2019re gonna bleed 99.5% of our energy on a fiat network. We\u2019re going to bleed 95% or more of our energy on a gold network. Once you calculate the fully diluted Bitcoin count \u2014 21,999,999.98, as I heard from Andreas the other day, that number just slightly less than 21 Million \u2014 once you\u2019ve done that, then you just realize that it\u2019s a lossless monetary energy system through time. Through space, it has a slight loss in the form of transaction fees, but it\u2019s a good thing, and the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are like a little bit of impedance and/or a little bit of gravity, a little bit of friction. And the goddess of wisdom that created the universe gave us a little bit of friction \u2014 it\u2019s a good thing! No gravity, no friction \u2014 your life gets really really complicated!"}

That\u2019s why the idea that I\u2019ve gotta drive transaction fees to zero is a silly idea! It\u2019s like, No! What we want to do is drive inflation or the loss of energy over time to zero, and then we want there to be a slight loss of energy when we reorganize all of the monetary energy. When I send $100 Million from New York to Tokyo, I don\u2019t mind spending $5. I probably won\u2019t mind spending $50! When Bitcoin has $250 Trillion of energy into it, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t pay $25 Billion in transaction fees! People forget \u2014 again \u2014 this is the problem of the crypto community: they\u2019re fixated upon a prototypical coin network that\u2019s a lab experiment, and they\u2019re comparing it to Bitcoin, instead of comparing Bitcoin to actual monetary or asset networks in the real world! So for example here\u2019s a real asset network: it\u2019s called real estate! I have $100 Trillion of real estate. You have a house. Let\u2019s say you have a $1 Million house. You wanna hold \u2014 this is a good example \u2014 let\u2019s assume that real estate is my energy network! If you wanna actually carry a $1 Million house 100 years \u2014 in Florida, there\u2019s a 2% real estate tax. You would pay $20,000 a year every year for 100 years, assuming that the house was capped and not reappraised, and so you\u2019re in essence going to lose the house in 50 years! Right? Under the best of circumstances! You\u2019re gonna lose all your wealth in about 20 years if you store your wealth or your monetary energy in a real estate network in Florida. So if you go to any other real estate jurisdiction, they\u2019ve all got different tax rates over time, but this is why you can\u2019t really store energy in property, because the tax rate generally will bleed you out in somewhere between 20-100 years. Now that\u2019s the inflation rate, or the energy loss rate over time. What about over space? What if you wanted to transfer a $100 Million house? What if I want to buy it from you? So you want to exchange \u2014 heat exchange, energy exchange \u2014 you want to exchange the energy in the house? Well it\u2019s a 6% transaction fee, and at the point that I said, Robert I want to buy your house, I\u2019ll give you $1 Million bucks for it. How many days \u2018till closing? 30? Probably 30! Okay, so you just paid $60,000 and waited a month in order to do your transaction! Now compare that to Bitcoin again? 30 minutes? $6 bucks? 30 days, $60,000! This is why we don\u2019t use property as an energy network! By the way, some people do! You can ask people point blank, How are you gonna actually give your money to your granddaughter? Well I\u2019m gonna buy property. But it where? California? Florida? Where? It\u2019s the same counterparty risk! It\u2019s worse than gold! You can move 3,000 lbs of gold in 30 days for $150,000-$200,000! You can\u2019t move $100 Million worth of property in 30 days to another country!"}

If Bitcoin gets to be $100 Trillion and there\u2019s 1% transaction fees, it\u2019s going to be \u2014 well pick any number and multiply it by 1%! It\u2019s $1 Trillion a year in transaction fees! Nothing wrong with that! What\u2019s the entire size of the \u2014 you know what the spreads are in the bond industry? Like, I used to buy and sell convertible debt. There were 200 basis point spreads. You could buy at 0.98%, you could sell at 0.96% \u2014 the banks got in between! So all of the financial system is built on taking a spread. That\u2019s why New York City has tall buildings! We\u2019ve talked about this before. Wherever there\u2019s a node in a network \u2014 a rail head, Venice, Paris, London, New York \u2014 wherever there\u2019s a node in a central network where there\u2019s exchange, there\u2019s a transaction fee. And if you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s only 1% or 2%! When you\u2019re unlucky \u2014 I mean there\u2019s a reason people refer to free ports. Free port meant that when you pull your ship into our port we weren\u2019t gonna steal it all! You know what the great breakthrough is in Singapore? Here\u2019s the breakthrough: we\u2019re gonna have a port in the middle of the Pacific where when the ship comes into our port, we don\u2019t take all of their cargo! Or we don\u2019t take 10% of their cargo! That\u2019s your idea? Yeah! That\u2019s my idea! We\u2019re gonna let them stop here and not seize 10% of their stuff! Wow! That\u2019s a brilliant idea! By the way, that\u2019s such a unique concept that Singapore is Singapore! It is the greatest port in the Pacific \u2014 because it\u2019s so rare that a country agrees not to take 3% of what you have when you stop! You can\u2019t even come into the United States without filling out a customs form where they charge you a 10% duty on whatever you have in your possession! The point is: it\u2019s very common to take 10% of what you have when you come and when you leave. That\u2019s why those cities are cities! That\u2019s why those empires are empires! So when someone sits around and they whine about $5 in transaction fees is too great, they\u2019re whining because it\u2019s more expensive than their laboratory experiment on their scientific workbench that no one\u2019s using! Yeah, I can conceptualize hypothetically in my perfect world a perfect system where it was better. But the real world is $100 Trillion worth of real estate and $250 Trillion worth of bonds and stocks and gold and silver and other property! And that stuff\u2019s moving around with transaction fees which are high enough to have paid for all the buildings in London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Venice, and Rome! It\u2019s not a new idea to charge transaction fees! It\u2019s not a problem! And the beauty of Bitcoin is, as more miners come on, they create a very competitive industry, and if a miner charges too much transaction fees, someone else is gonna drive the cost of transaction fees down, and if the revenue from transaction fees falls below the variable cost of running the mining rigs, people are gonna take mining rigs out of production eventually \u2014 unless a government wants to subsidize them! Unless a government\u2019s gonna be subsidizing the crypto rails which create the 21st economy, and that\u2019s a reason why mining is a bit riskier as a business than owning Bitcoin! Because you\u2019re getting into a commodity business where you may get driven down to the variable cost of the electricity, or below the variable cost of the electricity if someone else wants to get into the business and they can. It\u2019s good for Bitcoin, it\u2019s good for everything built above the chain! Caveat emptor if you wanna get into the commodity \u2014 or the business of encrypted energy!"}

I think that\u2019s a great point too that you bring up the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are set at fair market value.

How good was that? Another great episode with Mr. Saylor! I think we\u2019re starting to see things coming together in this episode where all of this foundation we\u2019ve been laying starts to relate and highlight the significance of Bitcoin in the modern age. We started out talking about Bitcoin being the first true digital monetary network in history. There had been prior attempts with things like E-Gold and other things, but they had never solved the issue of counterparties, frankly! We\u2019ve never had a trust-minimized digital money that was basically more or less free of counterparty risk! And Saylor brings up the great point that Bitcoin \u2014 at the time that we recorded was well over $200 Billion market cap \u2014 and when you look at Bitcoin through that lens as a digital energy network, other digital energy networks like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc., one they pass that $100 Billion milestone, it tends to be kind of a point of no return! And also a point that leads them to realizing these winner-take-all dynamics in digital competition. And he also makes a great point that, at that point in those companies\u2019 life cycles, those digital energy networks\u2019 life cycles, 99% of the investment community still doesn\u2019t get it! When Amazon or Apple is at $100 Billion market cap, people were still just writing them off and didn\u2019t realize that these were gonna be even multi-trillion dollar companies today! So I thought that was really interesting that Bitcoin is really at that juncture where it\u2019s crossed the multi-hundred billion dollar market cap threshold, and that gives it a lot of resiliency to disruption or downside potential, where it still has just a ton of upside potential if you look at it even in the context of gold\u2019s market cap, or other stores of value. And I liked that Saylor went to how these digital networks, they\u2019re dematerializing some ineffable quality. Like social media is friendship, or with Apple you could say maybe it\u2019s information or communication, and with Bitcoin it\u2019s money. And it\u2019s taking that ineffable quality to a lower energy state, something that\u2019s more crystalline-like, and when it does that \u2014 using the analogy of a phase transition \u2014 let\u2019s say water going from liquid to ice, all of this thermal energy is released! And in an economic sense that would be value or cash flows or market cap. What I think he called was an exothermal reaction, where is actually collapses to a state that requires lower energy to remain cohesive, and gives off that excess energy in the form of value of some kind. I thought that was a brilliant way to look at it! And it calls to mind again standardization, right? When we achieve certain standards and everyone starts singing off the same song sheet, productivity just explodes! So our effort necessary to maintain the network collapses, so the network gains a lot of density, and then in doing that it just throws off all of this \u2014 whatever the ineffable quality is that it\u2019s aiming for, whether it\u2019s energy or value or productivity for instance. And then Saylor was so kind to actually answer the question that we always ask on this show, which is, What is money? And the way he puts it is that, Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. And indeed if you go back to what we talked about in Episode 1 to those Stone Age technologies, that\u2019s what human beings have been doing to advance themselves. That is what distinguishes man from animal in fact, is that we harness energy and channel it across the field lines of our intellect, essentially. The three Stone Age technologies we looked at were: fire, missiles, and water. Fire was harnessing and channeling chemical energy, missiles were kinetic energy, and water was gravitational energy! And in the modern era, we\u2019ve evolved past that and now we\u2019re dealing with things like thermal energy, electrical energy, and nuclear energy! And the point that he makes is that, All of the meta-energy, if you will, that controls all of the others is money! Money is the claim on the collective savings of humanity. It\u2019s a claim on the efforts present, past, or future of all of us! So any group that commands one of these forms of energy can be commanded themselves by money. So it makes money this form of meta-energy, which I thought was a very interesting definition! [1:16:27] And it\u2019s also what defines civilization in a way. It\u2019s like, What types of energy are we harnessing? Are we a Stone Age civilization that\u2019s only harnessing fire? And at what scale are we doing that? At what scale are we channeling that energy? Those two aspects are kind of what defines civilization in a lot of ways! And he makes the point too that the challenge has always been moving the energy across domain, and this domain can either be a jurisdictional or governmental domain \u2014 how do you get your capital out of one country into another with the least loss possible, it could be characterological \u2014 so if I\u2019m going from thermal energy to kinetic energy, what\u2019s the most efficient way to do that? We could look at something like the steam engine was such a breakthrough because it allowed us to transition energy the most lossless way. Or even just moving the energy across space and time! If we can harness it and store it in a medium that\u2019s reliable and then transport it somewhere else and redeem it at later times for later uses, that has a lot of value as well! As humans try to go into the world and solve problems. So in that lens, historically at least, gold was energy money! It\u2019s what captured the residual energy that mankind was able to produce, that was not able to be put to a higher and better use. So if we couldn\u2019t dedicate our efforts towards any other activity that could increase productivity more than say gold mining, then we would just go and mine gold! And gold, again being this hard energy money, would sort of be \u2014 it\u2019s annual appreciation would be a proxy for the aggregate productivity growth in an economy. And unless your investment could outperform that, say it\u2019s 2-3% a year, then you would just mine gold! So it kind of provided this floor for human energy, and it was a medium through which we stored and transported it. But, I love this part where Saylor went into the math behind why gold sucks! Even though it was the best thing we ever had historically, it still sucks as an energy money! One was, If you want to move gold around the world once, say it costs you 25 basis points, which on $100 Million is $250,000 just to move it around the world once! So if you\u2019re doing that once a quarter that\u2019s 1% energy loss per year. And then something \u2014 which we got into \u2014 you would almost have to do, because if you\u2019re gonna store gold, you\u2019ve gotta put it in a vault. It\u2019s gotta be physically safeguarded over a long period of time, and you have to trust a counterparty. You have to trust a custodian! And as we went through history, many of these custodians and nation states have fallen over, so if you wanted to transport wealth across 100 years, you would necessarily need to change locations rather frequently just to avoid and minimize that risk! So that was across space, say it costs 1% a year to move it 4\u20135 times a year across space. And then also, gold production increases by about 2% a year, so gold\u2019s got a 2% dilution built right into it from gold mining. So if you put those two together, call it 3% loss per year on this monetary energy batter \u2014 you\u2019ve got a 22-year half-life! In 22 years, holding your value in gold, you\u2019re gonna get cut in half! So that\u2019s just not that great as far as building something with a long time horizon! After 100 years, you\u2019re talking about 87% loss in value if you\u2019re storing in gold! And that\u2019s your best case! That\u2019s assuming that you move it to the right places and you don\u2019t end up storing it in a Frankfurt or Tokyo in 1900 or any of these other cities that lost a war or their institutions were compromised. This assumes that you make the right moves with it! Your best case is let\u2019s say a 90% loss in value. Your worst case is 100% because of confiscation outright, or theft. If you\u2019re Poland and Germany invaded your country your gold was stolen! And Bitcoin is just fundamentally different because it\u2019s this form of money that\u2019s digitized energy! So it\u2019s not stored in a physical corporeal form that can be seen, targeted, confiscated. It\u2019s informational, which allows you a lot of unique ways to custody it in these ultra-high security schemas that are largely resistant to these forms of counterparty risk that we\u2019ve seen gold succumb to in the past. And then we got into commodities, the economic principles surrounding them. [1:21:54] And I liked how he described gold mining in that the cap-ex deployed into gold mining is really largely for the purpose of mining gold, and the switching costs related to it are very high, so you can\u2019t just turn your gold miner off and start mining silver, right? In some cases, depending on the actual piece of equipment, it only may be useful for mining gold. But assuming it\u2019s useful for mining something else, you have to pull it out of the mine, put it on a truck or a ship, ship it somewhere else, redeploy it, not to mention all the training and security involved with that! So very high switching cost on the cap-ex related to gold mining, and this leads to specialized producers overproducing! So they\u2019ll overproduce this commodity \u2014 gold \u2014 down to the point where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, so there\u2019s no profit. And even below at times. Again they\u2019re trying to amortize the cost of this cap-ex that invested in gold mining. Or, it could also possibly \u2014 if they get desperate enough \u2014 they could also seek a government subsidy that can allow them to mine below the cost of capital even further! And so all of this leads to commodity money getting destroyed! The incentives are to always increase its supply and always compress its margins. The way Saylor puts this is that the energy being channeled into commodity production, it\u2019s actually \u2014 the incentives related to it \u2014 are targeting human ingenuity at destroying that commodity! You\u2019re commodifying it, which is to say compressing its profit margin and increase its supply! Whereas those incentives in Bitcoin are fundamentally different, which we\u2019ll touch on shortly. But the interesting thing here with gold as a commodity or energy money is that it was a stable form of energy at room temperature. Which as we touched on in prior episodes, is akin to the breakthrough with consumer packaged goods, with Post foods, so they could store food energy at room temperature in the form of corn flakes or other canned or dried goods. This also points to \u2014commodification at least \u2014points to this interesting configuration in the world where we have, say, the electric and water networks. And in our civilization they\u2019re clearly the most important, right? If you turned off electricity or water, chaos would ensue! Whereas if you turned off say Google or Amazon, it might be inconvenient, but it\u2019s not necessarily gonna be this whole breakdown in society! But, Amazon and Google are tremendously more valuable on a market cap basis than electric and water networks, and the answer to why is because electric and water networks are commodified. They have become this network that\u2019s so fundamental to civilization that we\u2019ve optimized how we produce and distribute these goods in a way that makes them ultra-cost effective to the consumer. Whereas things like Amazon or Google, they haven\u2019t been commoditized yet. They\u2019re still new enough, they\u2019re newly explored industrial territory if you will. There\u2019s still very large margins there and they\u2019re also monopolists. As we saw earlier in the Steel Age in the railroads and whatnot, in these newly charted industrial spaces you tend to have monopolies first before commodification. First of all the monopolists set standards. Once the standards are set, the commodification sets in and actually compresses the margin and leads us to the more free market environment we have today! So commodification also points to why FAANG stocks \u2014 which are being predominantly used as a store of value today \u2014 since the store of value function of fiat has been so compromised, we see a lot of institutional capital pulls, high net worth individuals, everyone really, that would typically depend on fiat currency as a store of value, resorting to the FAANG stocks or other high-flying tech stocks, as a store of value! Something that is reliably scarce enough to hold its value across time. But commodification \u2014 the history of it, and the economic principles behind it \u2014 actually point towards why that\u2019s a really bad strategy for the long run! Because we\u2019re early in the digital age, these data monopolies, although they could be expected to persist for some time \u2014 years, possibly even decades \u2014 it\u2019s very unlikely that the large profit margins they\u2019re enjoying today will persist far into the future. What\u2019s more likely is that now that standards are established, we\u2019ll see commodification of some of these digital utilities that are monopolized today! If history is any indicator. So in that way the FAANG stocks, although they\u2019re like a primary store of value today maybe second only to government bonds, and increasingly so now that government bonds are largely going negative, they make for a really poor long term store of value. And this also points to Bitcoin and the uniqueness of it in that Bitcoin is like the ultimate store of value through this lens of commodification, because it actually resists commodification! So Bitcoin mining is this race to produce hashes more cheaply. We\u2019re thinking about hash as a vote or a lottery ticket trying to solve the puzzle to win the coinbase reward, which is the newly minted Bitcoin in every block every 10 minutes. So the commodification of Bitcoin is actually in the energy being allocated into its network, however \u2014 and this is where Bitcoin is so unique \u2014 is that, every 4 years, the algorithm adjusts itself in such a way that it actually pushes back on this commodifying force by cutting its new supply flow in half! So at the halving, the operation and energy expense being allocated to generate a hash\u2014which is to create Bitcoin basically\u2014that same cost flows into half as much Bitcoin being produced! So as Bitcoin is undergoing this downward pressure to cost of production as people figure out how to generate hashes more cheaply with cheaper energy or better ASICs or whatever the breakthrough is, the algorithm pushes back every 4 years! You\u2019re pressing down cost to production in one way, but every 4 years we\u2019re gonna double it! And that\u2019s actually the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin so interesting, because that keeps ratcheting it\u2019s marginal cost of production higher, and as we know by studying commodities and money, that the marginal cost of revenue or the market price tends to converge to the marginal cost of production. So the algorithm actually has this rising floor cost of production, and that\u2019s what\u2019s ratcheting its market price higher and higher! And if you look at the price action of Bitcoin historically on the log scale matched over these halvings you see it perfectly! It\u2019s not to say that that will hold indefinitely into the future, but it\u2019s definitely very unique in that we\u2019ve never seen an asset that has this \u2014 at least we\u2019re 12 years in \u2014 very predictable and algorithmically driven market value. It\u2019s definitely influenced by the algorithm! So that\u2019s really interesting and really unique to economics. The other thing that\u2019s interesting to me about that is it\u2019s inverting the economic principles behind commodification. So if you think: the ratcheting effects in, say, gold production will actually be to produce gold more cheaply over time. So just make gold more and more cheaply over time, which actually points to why gold was selected as money because it was so resistant to commodification! You couldn\u2019t get the cost of gold production lower because it\u2019s so scarce and hard to produce! But because Bitcoin\u2019s pushing back, instead of all of that energy flowing into producing cheaper Bitcoin, it\u2019s actually pushing us to just seek out cheaper energy, so it\u2019s created this global perpetual incentive scheme to figure out cheaper ways to make energy. Because that\u2019s the only way to access cheaper Bitcoin production, effectively, although Bitcoin just keeps getting harder to produce! [1:32:23] So it\u2019s just really really unique economics to think about! And then we went into the settlement aspects of Bitcoin, and why comparing it to another crypto asset is simply the wrong comparison. Saylor made a great point that, if you want to compare the cost to settle in Bitcoin, you have to compare it to gold, because with gold, you are settling in finality. If I flip you a gold coin, you put it in your pocket and walk away, you and I have participated in an irreversible transaction! There\u2019s no authority in the world that can make you give me that coin back, and there\u2019s no authority in the world that can \u2014 aside from gold mining \u2014 that can devalue that coin! So we\u2019ve transferred a token of self-sovereign wealth. It is a final transaction, a final settlement. And there\u2019s only one other asset in the world that lets you do that in a fully depoliticized way. You could argue that Ethereum allows you to do that, but Ethereum is subject to political attack vectors, we don\u2019t know its whole supply, there is a small group of people that control its functioning, whereas it\u2019s just not true for Bitcoin. It\u2019s the only truly decentralized digital asset in the world! So that points to another way to think about Bitcoin. Another analogy that we went into was the superconductive monetary network. It\u2019s a lossless energy network. So we can now transmit this meta-energy that is money across time, across space, across jurisdictional domain, governmental domain, with the least amount of loss! And the analogy there to superconductivity is that superconductivity is effectively cooling the conductive material to a very low temperature. So a very low entropy medium, and by getting the entropy out of the channel, it maximizes the flow of energy! There\u2019s the least impedance or the least friction in the channel. And I love that analogy for Bitcoin, because that\u2019s the breakthrough that Bitcoin is, right? It\u2019s the first asset we have in history that has absolute zero-percent noise in the channel, which is: unexpected supply and inflation. Everyone knows and can agree to what the supply is and what the supply ever will be! And the other thing that analogy points toward is that it\u2019s very expensive to achieve that! There\u2019s a great deal of energy expenditure necessary to achieve superconductivity, or to achieve this breakthrough, but once you get there, you release all of these productivity gains! Again, kind of like that phase transition to a lower energy state: when it crystallizes, it just throws off this exothermic reaction of value, cash flow, profit, whatever it is! That\u2019s what Bitcoin\u2019s done! We\u2019ve now had this singular moment breakthrough which we could call the Genesis block\u2014pretty everything from there is a step function of the algorithm\u2014that is now releasing all of these gains into the world in terms of reducing frictions to trade, reducing the noise and theft in the channel from inflation, and then giving us a medium of wealth storage that can\u2019t be confiscated! So it\u2019s taken a lot of unpredictability out of money, if you will! And that same achievement can also be analogized to achieving escape velocity, which I thought was a really cool analogy. And that once you get \u2014 you know there\u2019s a huge expenditure to get into orbit \u2014 if you imagine a rocket, how much fuel it has to expend, how much ingenuity and design and science has to go into building a rocket to get it going fast enough away from the Earth to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational field \u2014 but once you get into orbit, all of a sudden your returns on energy expending go to like near-infinity! The example Saylor gave was throwing a baseball in a baseball field. It\u2019ll go a hundred feet if you\u2019ve got a strong arm. You throw that same baseball in orbit, it just goes around the Earth forever! So your returns on energy expended just explode, it just becomes astronomical! And about this Saylor said, Bitcoin is the most efficient system for channeling energy through time and space in the history of mankind. If we just sit with that for a while and really think about the profundity of something like that, and that we are the species that channel energy across time and space. That\u2019s what distinguishes us as man! And here we have the system that has achieved this function to a higher degree than any other system we\u2019ve ever created! That\u2019s the breakthrough that Bitcoin is! It\u2019s something truly remarkable! And it\u2019s why so many of us have decided to devote our life to it, talking about it, educating others! I love the engineering mindset and lens that Saylor brought to this equation. I talked about a lot of these aspects of Bitcoin previously, but I was more focused on the time side, which time too is like absolutely scarce, but it\u2019s more of an experiential aspect of reality. Whereas Saylor is very focused on the energy, which is much more of an engineering or physicist aspect of reality, and much more measurable and objective than even time! So I think it\u2019s kind of saying the same thing, but just speaking to a different audience in a way. I think it\u2019s just really good stuff that he\u2019s bringing to the table! The last part I thought was cool about the absolute zero superconductive monetary network for achieving escape velocity, was the example of the Hubble space telescope. So for the whole history of astronomy, we\u2019ve been pointing our telescopes toward the sky, but we\u2019ve dealt with atmospheric distortion \u2014 something we\u2019ve had to correct for, something that for certain objects far into the distance we just couldn\u2019t even see, and it\u2019s all because we had this distortion of the atmospheric shell that surrounds our planet! But again once we achieved this escape velocity and we got into Earth orbit, we got a telescope up there in the form of Hubble telescope, that when we started to see our Universe in a whole new way with a whole entirely new degree of clarity and precision unlike anything we have ever seen before! Just totally free of atmospheric distortion! And it\u2019s because we eliminated the frictions to visibility, if you will. We\u2019ve eliminated the frictions to communication \u2014 in this case, communicating light to the eye or light to the telescope \u2014 and it gave us this entirely new perspective on the Universe. And I think Bitcoin is just going to do something similar! We\u2019ve eliminated the atmospheric distortions, if you will, of counterparty risk, monetary inflation, commodification \u2014 all of these things that have screwed up every monetary system historically and broken civilization after civilization \u2014 all of a sudden we have this invention through Bitcoin that\u2019s like the Hubble telescope! It exists in an orbit that\u2019s beyond man\u2019s reach \u2014 which is really important, so it\u2019s not vulnerable to counterparty attack vectors \u2014 we all know what the inflation rate is and ever will be, so there\u2019s no unexpected inflation. And it\u2019s just a lossless energy network, as Saylor says! It\u2019s something that\u2019s a really big breakthrough! The other thing there is the price signals that it would propagate. Price signals being the coordinating force in any economy \u2014 they\u2019ve always suffered from these distortions that we just mentioned like inflation and counterparty risk and what have you \u2014 uncertainty in general, entropy, entropy in the channel. By being an entropy-less or entropy-minimized monetary channel, a Bitcoin-denominated world promises to allocate capital more efficiently than ever before! And that may sound kind of economic-nerdy when you say allocating capital, but that means putting people and assets in the right place! So they\u2019re best satisfying wants or best solving problems for the demands of market participants! So it will lead us to a world where more of our desires are more easily satisfied. This is a really really big deal! And Saylor talked too \u2014 I like this \u2014 that there\u2019s kind of two types of people: we have the doers in the world, and we have the nay-sayers. I would also say we could call those the tinkerers and the bureaucrats, or the entrepreneurs and the legislators. And what distinguishes these two people is: one is action-oriented \u2014 willing to fail, willing to take risks, willing to put their skin in the game, whereas the other one is just contrarian \u2014 says things can\u2019t be done. I flash back to the example of the Wright brothers where every intellectual in the world\u2014there was basically consensus among them all that man would never fly! Until these two guys flew in their garage. So it\u2019s a really idea to bet against human ingenuity. If history shows nothing else, it\u2019s that we have this amazing ability to problem-solve in a way that we can\u2019t even fathom! So the point being \u2014 when we looked at a commodity money versus something like Bitcoin \u2014 is that it\u2019s a really bad idea to try and run a monetary system based on a commodity. It\u2019s much better to run a monetary network which is intended to be a system for allocating our time and our energy based on math! Based on a system that has inviolable rules or one that incentivizes fair play versus a twisting of the rules, because that would actually produce the best outcome, and the best moment of play. When rules are fixed, players are gonna play the game to the best of their ability. But when rules are bendable or breakable, you\u2019re actually creating incentives to behave in a corruptive or exploitative way. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is. Through that game theoretical lens you could say that it\u2019s a fixed rule set that no one can change or manipulate. And looking at a money based on a commodity versus a money based on math, Bitcoin is actually channeling human ingenuity in a way that causes it to improve over time, and in a way that causes civilization to improve. Whereas a commodity money is gonna be channeling human energy and ingenuity into the compression of the profit margins on that commodity, and the overproduction of that commodity! So it makes so much more sense to be in a true, digital money with a rule set based in math, versus something based on our ability to produce it in the natural world! It\u2019s such a leap forward in innovation and in potentially civilization advance as well that it\u2019s hard to even comprehend how big of a deal this is! And finally we touched on the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. So although it\u2019s a \u201clossless\u201d monetary system, there is a need \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be a need \u2014 for some resistance in the channel, which we would call transaction fees. And this is essentially the fee we\u2019re paying to the miners for securing the network. And we could think, as Saylor alluded to, the goddess of wisdom always introduced a little bit of friction! It\u2019s kind of like all things exist in opposition. We need something to push against to move forward. You could also think of the transaction fees as the expense or the tax we\u2019re paying to the governors of the network, which the enforcers of the rules are the miners. So in the same way you pay taxes to the government ostensibly to protect and preserve your private property rights, in the Bitcoin universe we actually have to pay this tax to the mining network so that they can secure the monetary network itself and preserve our private property rights in the Bitcoin time chain. So to argue that a crypto asset needs to eliminate the transactions is just sort of ignorant of this fundamental truth that we need it in a monetary network. What we need truly in a monetary network is zero unexpected energy loss or inflation, which Bitcoin provides. So I hoped you guys enjoyed that episode! Again that was our first session on Day 2. We\u2019re now into Bitcoin theory, we\u2019re getting into the Modern Age and it\u2019s only going to get more interesting from here, so I\u2019ll see you in the next episode!"}

Our special guest today is Michael Saylor himself, fresh from the Bitcoin for Corporations conference in which he promoted Bitcoin to corporate America. He made a very very strong case for Bitcoin, why it matters for corporations, and why it matters for corporate balance sheets. We\u2019ve had Michael on before\u2014we spoke about his ideas on Bitcoin and his ideas on inflation and cost of living, and he\u2019s been an absolute thunderball of inspiration and powerful ideas since coming into the Bitcoin space over the last year! And it\u2019s an absolute pleasure to have him back again! Thank you very much for coming back, Michael!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [04:44]: My impression was: I was surprised at how much enthusiasm there is! We started in August, we were the first public company to make a serious commitment, and then Square followed us, and then Marathon Patent did a pretty big Bitcoin acquisition for their balance sheet a few weeks ago, $150 Million. And then when Tesla did, we\u2019ve now got four public companies in a row that have all made pretty material commitments! Of course, the market\u2019s been enthusiastic! Generally, the market\u2019s been very supportive of all the Bitcoin companies. If you look at Square\u2019s stock, PayPal\u2019s stock, Riot Blockchain\u2019s stock, Marathon\u2019s stock, Microstrategy\u2019s been well treated, I think Tesla of course is the most successful stock of the year. We\u2019ve checked off one question, which was, How will public shareholders view this? And there was some trepidation, and in fact they\u2019ve viewed it enthusiastically! For example, since Marathon did their $150 Million Bitcoin acquisition, their stock doubled! If you\u2019re wondering how the public shareholders will view it, oftentimes the thing that holds back public companies from doing something is their concern about how it will be perceived by their outside shareholders. And because it\u2019s very difficult to meet with outside shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re changing every minute of the day between 9:30 and 4:00 PM, right? Your shareholder base is changing! So it\u2019s like trying to grab onto a whirlpool in the middle of an ocean! You can\u2019t quite get your hands around it \u2014 it\u2019s dynamic! That\u2019s a challenge, but as we came in the conference I thought\u2014first of all, there\u2019s a lot of demand bubbling up! We had a lot of people asking us! A lot of people asking us, How\u2019d you do this? What should we do? There\u2019s illegal issues, regulatory issues, where you trip the 1940 Act, are you gonna need an ETF, what\u2019s the accounting treatment for it, what\u2019s the appropriate corporation governance? You know, rather than try to have one meeting at a time \u2014 Saifedean, you realize at some point, if you had 40 hours of meetings a week for the next 30 years, well that\u2019s like 2,000 times 30, right? What is that, 6,000? You can touch 6,000 people in 30 years! You just can\u2019t go fast enough! So you can\u2019t do these one at a time. So we thought, let\u2019s just go ahead and add it as a track to Microstrategy World, which was all virtual, and I thought \u2014 by the way, Microstrategy World last year was 2,500 of our customers in a room and it cost us $4 Million, and it cost them probably another $6 Million, so we spend $10 Million in 2019 to put 2,500 customers into a convention center. This year\u2019s Microstrategy World, we probably spent 1/15th that much money, our customers spent nothing, so we spent probably 1/30th! We reduced our travel and entertainment and event budget by 97%! We reduced all of our travel and events budget by 98% year over year, if you want an interesting factoid \u2014 98%! So Microstrategy World was pulled off for 97% less money, we had 21,000 people registered instead of 2,500. We thought, We\u2019ll tack on Bitcoin for Corporations as an afterthought. I thought, Well if we get 800 that\u2019ll be good! Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll probably get 1,000. Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll get 2,000! And I went on television and I said, Well I think we\u2019ll get 2,000, and then we had this surge, and the day of the event \u2014 no joke, it broke the Internet! Like it actually broke our video server, and the stress was, we blew through 15,000 people and I was on the phone with my IT people saying, Get more capacity from our vendor! And for like an hour or two hours in the morning leading up to the noon thing we were like maxed out and I was worried! So some enterprising cyber hornets \u2014 I love the Bitcoiners, they\u2019re so enterprising! \u2014 while I\u2019m trying to solve the problem the conventional way, someone turns on livestreaming to YouTube, and they set up bootleg live streaming channels that have thousands of people on them! When we finally got to the noon session with Ross \u2014 who you introduced me to by the way I think, thank you!\u2014 so we got to the noon session with Ross and we had 8,500 come into that session, so I thought I\u2019d have 2,000 and we went to 8,500! I thought I\u2019d have 1,500 companies represented, and it was actually 7,000 companies represented in the live session! And then the live session got bootlegged out and posted on YouTube, went viral, I think we\u2019re up to 250,000 views now! [09:58] So I guess the summary would be: exceeded my expectations! And we had people from Space X there, you know, some of Elon Musk\u2019s companies, we had people from Marathon there. The ones you would expect were there, but of course there\u2019s an avalanche of private companies, and there were a decent number of public companies and treasurers and CFO\u2019s that were lurking. Some of them don\u2019t want to have their names mentioned as you can imagine, because it\u2019s a sensitive topic, right? It\u2019s material for a company! But I think we can call it a success, because on television for the past few days, we\u2019ve had the CEO of GM asked if he\u2019s gonna invest in Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CFO of Twitter asked about Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CEO of Uber asked about Bitcoin! We just had the Miami, Francis Suarez, announce that they\u2019re moving forward to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and it\u2019s become part of the conversation, even to the extent that now people are grappling with the accounting and the volatility issues, which I account to be an incredible success for all of us! Because a year ago, no one would have even discussed this! This morning we had a milestone: in the CFO section of the Wall Street Journal, the challenges of incorporating Bitcoin on the balance sheet for CFOs was discussed in an article, and I think that\u2019s the first time that the Wall Street Journal in the CFO section had ever actually brought up the topic of Bitcoin! So the implication is: it\u2019s in the conversation everywhere! And increasingly, people have to come to terms with why they\u2019re not doing it. And there will be technical reasons \u2014 Oh! It\u2019s volatile, right? I mean, it\u2019s going up 200% a year, but it\u2019s going up, it\u2019s making us large sums of money in a volatile fashion, that\u2019s a technical reason. If you\u2019re an investor and your reason for not investing in something is, It\u2019s making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion \u2014 I\u2019m not even gonna say what I think of that! It\u2019s quite amusing to me! [12:14] But if I had to be criticized, I think I\u2019d like to be criticized for making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion! And then they\u2019re grappling with the accounting issues, because if you hold it as the underlying asset, it\u2019s currently accounted for as an intangible on the balance sheet, which is the most conservative way. Kind of like the way you\u2019d account for patents or things like that. You know, if you hold it as a fund, then it may, under certain circumstances, be accounted for as an investment asset. But then if you have a fund, it\u2019s a security! And if you hold the asset, it\u2019s property and a commodity! And if you have a lot of securities, at some point you might trip the SEC 1940 Act and become a finance company, because you have more than 40% of your assets as securities. There are a lot of nuances and people are grappling with them, but they\u2019re good debates, right? Good discussions to be having right now! And a year ago, no one would have even considered these matters! So we have injected this into the conversation I think around the world, and I think the Bitcoin conference was part of it. Clearly the Tesla purchase was helpful! And I think February 8th, you could call Mainstream Day, Saifedean! February 8th, this year, was the date when the entire story of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset crossed outside of the Bitcoin and the Crypto community, and it was in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Irish News, The Straits Times \u2014 every major financial publication everywhere in the world, and all the mainstream media! I got invited the next day to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, FOX, CNN, NPR! And I\u2019m like, No more! I can\u2019t do any more! But the point is, CNN, NPR \u2014 these are not Bitcoin journalists, these are mainstream sources! So I think the message is exploding into the mainstream \u2014 you could start the clock: February 8th was the day the shot was heard around the world! And that, combined with the Bitcoin for Corporations Summit, placed this in the public domain. The beauty now of course it, I used to meet with 100 people, and I could meet with 10 a week, and then we met with 8,000 people, and then it went viral to 250,000 people, and now we\u2019ve published our Bitcoin Playbook, and that\u2019s out there circulating amongst lawyers and accountants and advisors and investors, and we just let that percolate and I think good things will happen!"}

I was going to say the exact thing that you mentioned which is: one year ago, none of this was going on anywhere! Nobody was talking about any of this stuff! I remember exactly it was one year ago, it was a conference, and I was with somebody who works in a Bitcoin company \u2014 they were talking about some blockchain nonsense \u2014 and I was telling them that the case for corporations really is: hold a small part of your balance sheet in Bitcoin! And especially if you\u2019re operating internationally, it will help you get around banking closures and it\u2019ll protect you from inflation also! The response I used to get when I\u2019d mention this to people was always, No! It\u2019s too volatile! And the accounting would be too much of a headache! There\u2019s no way anybody would do it! And it\u2019s incredible, and it\u2019s almost entirely down to you, how the conversation\u2019s entirely shifted in a year now to the point where we have a complete playbook that the lawyers and accountants can just go to microstrategy.com, download your corporate playbook, and they have the complete guide to how they need to answer those questions, and we\u2019ve already had thousands of them show up! So I think I can\u2019t but commend you for your incredible service to the cause! And this unbelievable contribution of just putting this out there and forcing it upon people! People call it speculation and people say, Well people are just speculating! But I think ultimately, every economic decision is speculation, and maybe the reason this speculation is paying off is because it is a better economic decision! Maybe it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a better asset on the balance sheet and the world is discovering that!"}

If you were walking through the desert and about to [die of thirst] then I dropped a water bottle that was sealed from a brand that you\u2019d never purchased in a supermarket before, it wouldn\u2019t be a speculation to crack open the water bottle and drink the water!

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [18:03]: So a couple of thoughts I had. You made this point: you were talking about money progressing from soft to hard. The gold standard was the culmination of commodity monies from glass beads and seashells and stone coins and the like, and copper and brass and eventually we get to gold and gold is pinnacle and silver is next. And so gold is the hardest commodity money, it lasts the longest, and then you make the point: human beings are able to take a longer view! Your time horizon stretches out! If you had seashells as money or carved wood sticks, your time horizon wouldn\u2019t last beyond the rotting of the wood sticks. Or your time horizon wouldn\u2019t last longer than when people trekked off of the seashore to get more seashells. So gold is the hardest money of that time period, and human beings were able to take a long view. They can create longer lasting structures, right? If you have a harder money, you can create a longer lived structure and that structure would be an institution. And the hard money is working against time. Time is the impedance, and the money is flowing through time! So I started thinking about that as an engineer and I thought, Materials progress from soft to hard, and we build with wood and then we build with brick and then we build with stone and then we build with iron and then we build with steel! And steel is, right now, the winner of the materials, and using the hardest material, human beings are able to create the largest and the tallest structures! They\u2019re working against gravity! So time is an elemental force, gravity is an elemental force, so the significance of steel is, I\u2019m able to build a 100-story skyscraper, and the significance of strong money, or gold money, was, maybe I could create a 50 or 100-year old dynasty of some sort. Maybe I could even build a cathedral based upon the gold! Money progresses from slower to faster. When we get to Bitcoin, you\u2019ve got a harder money than gold, so if it\u2019s harder, that means in theory you can build structures like institutions that\u2019ll last longer than the gold institutions or the fiat institutions! I had the thought when Jack Dorsey just announced today that he put 500 Bitcoin into an institution or an endowment to finance Bitcoin development with a focus on Africa and the like. So presumably Bitcoin development, Lightning development, etc. And I thought, 500 Bitcoin will eventually be \u2014 if you don\u2019t spend it \u2014 it\u2019ll be worth $500 Million! We\u2019ll get to $1 Million a coin and then maybe Bitcoin will start to appreciate at 20% a year, 30%, and eventually it\u2019ll slow down, but you could borrow against $500 Million\u2014$50 Million a year \u2014 which is enough to finance a development unit of hundreds of software developers! Forever! You know, a simple rule of thumb: 500 BTC might reasonably support 500 professionals working an organization forever! Okay? Why? Because Number Goes Up, it\u2019s a store of value! If I put the equivalent amount of money into government bonds, the half-life is not gonna support anything, right? 500 BTC you can calculate it today \u2014 500 BTC is $25 Million, right? So $25 Million invested in something which is going up less than 20% a year is losing value! So the S&P wouldn\u2019t work, gold doesn\u2019t even work, they\u2019re both clocking in at 15% a year! Sovereign debt doesn\u2019t work! So the NASDAQ sort of works, it\u2019s going up. Big Tech sort of works, but you couldn\u2019t really say forever with Big Tech, because it\u2019s tied into \u2014 it\u2019s got so many risks and complexities! So if I endow an institution with the hardest money, I could reasonably have a 100-year or multi-100-year time horizon! And I\u2019d look you in the face and I\u2019d say, Yeah! It looks to me like 500 BTC will support 250 people at $200,000 a year, 500 people at $100,000 a year. I mean if you\u2019re supporting people in Africa, developers in Africa, right now the cost per engineer is $25,000-$50,000 a year, probably $25,000 a year! So you could support 500 people forever! Let\u2019s call it 1,000 years! I mean we could go back and forth, but \u2014 so hard money lets you work against time with an institution. And then I think you\u2019ve got this other dimension, which is, Is it smarter and is it faster? Bitcoin is maybe 10\u2013100x harder than gold, and so we can look out hundreds and hundreds of years. But it\u2019s millions of times faster than gold! I pointed this out the other day: if you have a $1 Billion block of gold that\u2019s 30,000 lbs, moving it across the continent is probably a $5 Million, 1,000-hour exercise. 1,000 hours to organize a few 747s, lots of armed guards, lots of diplomatic issues. So $5 Million, 1,000 hours! And if I want to move a $1 Billion block of Bitcoin \u2014 $5, 1 hour! A million times cheaper! A thousand times faster right now! And so that means when money progresses from slower to faster, humans are able to create higher frequency structures, and they\u2019re working against space or against friction! So longer-lived structures have to work against time. How am I gonna endow the foundation for 1,000 years? And higher frequency structures are all about, I need to move $1 Billion of gold every 2 hours! Or $1 Billion of money every 2 hours! Not every 2 months. And the gold, of course, is so low frequency \u2014 it doesn\u2019t oscillate at all, right? I mean, if you have 30,000 lbs of gold, how frequently does it move? I mean, didn\u2019t the French send that aircraft carrier to pick up their gold once, in a century?"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [25:35]: People that criticize Bitcoin for being slow, they\u2019re running these lab experiments in a garage on their little altcoin moving no money around! And it\u2019s kind of like criticizing someone running a power reactor when you\u2019ve got a lighter in your hand, you know? Like, it\u2019s totally unrelated! It\u2019s silly! If you\u2019re gonna compare the speed and the efficiency of Bitcoin, you have to compare it to the gold network, because you need to have final settlement on $1 Billion of money, of tangible property! And you\u2019re not really getting $1 Billion of settlement on a fiat network without so many other things. So I guess my point is: we have something that\u2019s gonna last a lot longer \u2014 it\u2019s harder. And then we have something which moves faster, so you create the potential of high-frequency structures which are inconceivable! Like a bank that actually makes $1 Billion loans and moves the money tangibly every day, every hour, every minute! There are certain structures people can\u2019t conceive of because they never thought about being able to tangibly move $1 Billion of monetary energy in 37 minutes and then move it back! In the crypto world they\u2019ve got this idea of flash loans, maybe that\u2019s the closest thing? I don\u2019t know how enamored I am of a flash loan that lasts for like 400 milliseconds? I don\u2019t know! It seems to me to be interesting but cute \u2014 maybe a little bit more gimmicky? I can definitely see the application of a loan that lasts 87 days! Or 31 days! Or maybe moving a block of money for 187 days! If I can do it with two institutional counterparties without the banks in the middle and the governments in the middle \u2014 and we\u2019ll get to this in a second, this fiat issue \u2014 that opens up a new world! You could imagine in like 1600 in Renaissance Europe, they\u2019re building buildings with masonry and they\u2019re 5 stories high and someone says, You know one day we\u2019ll have steel and we\u2019re gonna build 100-story skyscrapers and they\u2019ll be shaped differently! You know? And the architects couldn\u2019t even conceive of that because they didn\u2019t have a material strong enough. I don\u2019t think people can conceive of the kind of banks or the kind of institutions that we\u2019ll have with high-frequency money! And I think this last issue is that money progresses from dumber to smarter. Humans are able to create more complex structures and they\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 complexity? Maybe entropy is the word! So we\u2019re either working against time \u2014 we gotta be harder, we\u2019re working against space \u2014 we gotta be faster, we\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 we gotta be smarter! And the material is the semiconductor chip to make us smarter combined with Bitcoin, and the material is the network to make us faster combined with Bitcoin. I mean Bitcoin is basically sitting on the network on the chip getting harder, faster, smarter, and the conclusion you come to is: just like architecture, where I can break the laws of gravity \u2014 what does steel give us? It didn\u2019t just give us 50\u2013100 story buildings! It also gave us cantilevers and it also gave us bridges, right? And Carnegie made all his money by the way \u2014 I read his biography \u2014 his big customers were municipalities buying iron and steel for bridges! Bridges are a pretty big deal! Actually, you could make the argument: bridges may be even more important to civilization than skyscrapers! I mean, knock out the bridges in Manhattan and everybody starves to death! You ever see in a bridge \u2014 the bridge that connects San Francisco and Oakland, or the Bay bridge that connects the eastern shore of Maryland to D.C. \u2014 with the bridge it\u2019s a 1-hour commute. Without the bridge it\u2019s a 12-hour commute! Or it\u2019s an 18-hour drive! In one case I drive to work, in the other case, I don\u2019t! Right? It ends the civilization! So I think this element of money \u2014 I think you put your finger on something very fascinating, which is: as the money gets harder, we can see further into the future with our institutions! But I think, as it gets smarter and faster, we can construct institutions or relationships that are inconceivable before with slow, soft money! And I would say, that takes us to fiat. Fiat is softer money. It\u2019s faster than a block of gold, but it\u2019s still so much slower and stupider than Bitcoin!"}

It\u2019s a machine in a sense \u2014 it has its own truth within it! You can verify it even though it\u2019s a little bit expensive. But with fiat it\u2019s ultimately manual. But today\u2019s use, it is generally faster to move it around than moving around physical gold, but its real drawback as you were saying \u2014 in holding onto value for the future\u2014that\u2019s where it\u2019s really not good and in that sense, the way that I look at it is: the harder the money, the more it incentivizes us to lower our time preference and therefore makes us think more and more about the future, because the harder the money, the less uncertain the future! Because now you have something that\u2014I have this wealth, this monetary energy that I\u2019ve stored \u2014 and I have more certainty in the fact that it\u2019s going to be there in a year or in 2\u20133 years. So 1, 2, 3 years becomes more of a foreseeable thing for me, less of a uncertain thing for me, and so I start discounting less! When I start discounting it less, I start effectively lowering my time preference and providing for the future. And this is why I think the harder got\u2014silver and gold were continuously getting harder and silver was eliminated and gold was hardest\u2014that was the pinnacle of human achievement, arguably! This was when we made the most incredible technology! This was when we invented all these incredible things like the airplane and many, many, many things of the 19th century which I mentioned in The Bitcoin Standard! And I think in the 20th century, maybe we\u2019ve reversed that process because our money is getting easier and so the future is becoming less certain and so we\u2019re becoming more high time preference because we discount the future more!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [32:15]: I agree with that! Yeah I think you\u2019ve put your finger on something there which is: the future gets hazier and you see more anxiety! I mean I know as a corporate CEO, in March \u2014 as I was staring at a block of $500 Million US dollars and I was watching the money supply expand and the dollar devalue, my anxiety went through the roof! My anxiety went up so high that it kind of kicked me out of the fiat standard into the Bitcoin standard, right? Like the boiling frog, or jumping out of the boiling whatever! I mean it literally shocked me! It\u2019s all about engineering a mechanism or engineering a security for yourself, right? I mean, steel allows me to stand on a cantilevered structure a hundred feet over a canyon! Or it allows me to stand on a bridge 1,000 feet over the Hudson River or the East River with security! I can even drive a car over it and steel allows me to stand 800 feet in the air! And you imagine the insecurity of that, taking the structure away! Human beings are able to go to places with engineering. Space stations, right? We\u2019re able to go places with engineering, where otherwise you literally can\u2019t live! Like there\u2019s no life there without the engineering! You know, you got me thinking about the fiat standard and some of the criticisms I\u2019ve heard lately about energy consumption of Bitcoin got me thinking about, Well what\u2019s the comparable system? Again the critics are people that\u2014they have a little toy railroad train in their garage and they think, Well my toy railroad train is more efficient than Bitcoin! But they don\u2019t really contrast the energy consumption of Bitcoin to the energy consumption of the alternative system that it is replacing! So if you look at the fiat system, money\u2019s gotta do two things: it\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange and a store of value, and Bitcoin kind of is one structure and the fiat is another structure. So I look at the current system and I think, Well to make this work, when we replace the gold standard \u2014 I mean the gold standard in its \u2014 when commodity money reaches its pinnacle I suppose after all the shuffling around we eventually arrived at gold coins and silver coins! And gold in my opinion is store of value, and silver is the medium of exchange! You know, one of them was the day-to-day currency! A gold coin was like 8 grams, a quarter of an ounce? Feels like it\u2019s about a $500 coin? And so the gold coin is about 1 weeks salary for a laborer, and you wouldn\u2019t have used a $500 or $1,000 coin to pay for things routinely, but if I gave you a stack of ten of them, that\u2019s your treasury! So the silver coin is the medium of exchange, and in that standard you\u2019ve got a very clean structure! Gold coin, silver coin, you mine the gold, you mine the silver, you mint the gold, you mint the silver, you store the gold, you store the silver, they all circulate around! And eventually maybe they\u2019re gold notes, right? Maybe some notes that are fractional or fully reserve-banked \u2014 moving that around. [35:51] When we went to the fiat standard, we replaced that with\u2014the Treaty of Genoa got me thinking about this, Saifedean! \u2014 we replaced this with diplomats, corporations, accountants, lawyers, programmers, security guards, contractors, buildings, armies, software, mints \u2014 we kept the mints, we kept the printers, we kept the gold mines, we kept the vaults, and then we tacked on ideas like ETFs, bond indexes, bond funds, financial managers, and everything else around them, in order to create a medium of exchange and a store of value! I\u2019m trying to figure out how much energy is consumed by\u2014what is it, like 100,000 bank buildings? J.P. Morgan has 200,000 people, so I\u2019m guessing there must be in the finance industry around the world\u2014in the US it\u2019s like 8 Million \u2014 so half of the finance industry is tied up in store of value medium of exchange! So if we could figure it out it\u2019d probably be like 40 Million people in the world! Maybe it\u2019s 20\u201340 Million people! So what\u2019s the carbon footprint and the building footprint and the concrete footprint and the steel footprint and the electricity consumption of \u2014 and I was kind of kind \u2014 I\u2019m not really allocating all the armies and the like, but you could probably say, if you really wanted to keep track of the real cost of the system \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Yeah I mean, the first cost of the system is probably 20\u201330 Million bankers and financial advisors and the like! That\u2019s the primary cost! The secondary cost is all the government infrastructure, the diplomats and the military officials and the aircraft carriers and the armies and the back and forth! I guess the third cost is actually the wars themselves that get waged back and forth! And then I think the fourth cost \u2014 the pernicious cost \u2014 I guess is the inflation! If we\u2019re burning \u2014 you said 7\u20138% was the monetary inflation on average \u2014 if there\u2019s $500 Trillion of monetary assets and you\u2019re debasing 5% of it a year, even, that\u2019s $25 Trillion! So I dunno \u2014 $50 Trillion a year? It must be $50 Trillion! If we could somehow calculate that number \u2014 I mean if you really wanna do something useful \u2014 calculate the cost of the infrastructure, the banking infrastructure, then the governmental infrastructure, and then the first order cost of the currency debasement and the second order impact on the currency derivatives \u2014 the stocks, the bonds, and the real estate! And then after you\u2019ve done that you could throw in the business insolvency and the destruction of good enterprises and the political insolvency \u2014 destruction of good countries, right? The inefficiency of the system results in the destruction of entire countries! I guess the best example being like the meltdown of the Weimar Republic due to the Treaty of Versailles, which was I think largely the result of poor treatment of debt and, following World War I, I mean they pretty much crashed that entire political system because of the way they layered the debt asymmetrically on the Germans and not on the French and the Americans! We know how that one ended! Which wasn\u2019t good for anybody! I think we can see, in the 20th century, we see an example of lots of countries destroyed by the fiat standard. I\u2019m sensitive to all the companies destroyed by the fiat standard as well! The example of that is: as they keep cranking up the monetary expansion rate and as CEOs keep attempting to have their stock hold value, the only way the stock can hold value is to expand the cash flows per share faster than the rate of money expansion! And that means that in an environment where the money\u2019s expanding at 7% a year, if your company\u2019s growing at 3% a year, you can\u2019t store value in the stock, and the political pressure to hold value in the stock causes you to take on massive debt, and then the massive debt is used to either issue dividends or buy the stock back, and so what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019ve taken on $1 Billion of liabilities to actually pump the stock up and then you\u2019re impoverishing the company! Eventually you end up with the company having billions of dollars in debt and no equity, and then when you hit a crisis \u2014 like a technology crisis like Amazon attacks Toys \u201cR\u201d Us while they are insolvent \u2014 or you have a pandemic crisis and they shut down your restaurant and you\u2019re insolvent! So the crises create insolvencies because the companies are undercapitalized because they took on debt under political pressure to keep their stock up! And you could see that playing out even right now, where the majority of CFOs \u2014 like we just saw, I\u2019m not gonna name the CFOs \u2014 but the majority of CEOs and CFOs will say, We\u2019re gonna take our cash and buy our stock back, and conventional financial thinking is: Reward CEOs and CFOs for buying stocks back and issuing dividends, and criticize them for buying Bitcoin or tangible assets with their cash flows! Like, I would be criticized as a speculator taking risks with my balance sheet even though today I have $3.2 Billion of tangible assets on my balance sheet! A year ago I had $500 Million, right? And conventional wisdom is, You should give away the $500 Million and have zero! So conventional thinking is: decapitalize the company! And you\u2019re really ostracized or criticized if you convert cash from a weak asset to a strong asset! Primarily by conventional thinking. I know I said a lot, and I threw a lot out there but I should pause and we should just talk about it because I think there\u2019s a lot of interesting implications and they start with this idea of the fiat system and the fiat standard!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [42:51]: Yeah! That is great! Thank you for that! The cost of the fiat standard is all the things that you mentioned. There\u2019s also the business cycle which is constantly causing misallocation of capital and causes businesses to make malinvestments which get wiped out all the time! And then there\u2019s the fact that \u2014 and this is primarily outside the US , it\u2019s a much bigger problem elsewhere\u2014 which is that you have the countries pay its balances, all of their international account and their current account, all of it is settled with the central bank\u2019s cash balance, which is also used to back people\u2019s deposits in the banking system, and it is also used to buy government bonds, so essentially just financing government bonds. [43:41] And it backs the national currency. So you\u2019re constantly putting all of society\u2019s savings and all of the society\u2019s ability to trade with the outside world essentially as collateral for government to borrow against! And of course, government has high time preference incentives to continue to abuse this all the time, and so it ends up creating all kinds of destruction of savings and destruction of capital. I think that\u2019s really \u2014 well it\u2019s hard to estimate which is the biggest \u2014 but if you think about a century of misallocation of capital, when you think about, How much capital was misallocated? And, How much capital was essentially leaked away from prudent, productive people who have put it away to finance their future and then suddenly saw it go Poof! because their central bank had printed it! And all of that went to finance wasteful government spending and war and investment in things that were not chosen on the market! If you think about the opportunity cost of that over a century, I think the world would be a very different place! And I don\u2019t necessarily have to speculate about technological achievements that we haven\u2019t made, but I think with the things that we have, owning a house with 24-hour electricity and running water is probably something that would be attainable for everybody in the world if money was hard! If you think about it, anybody, particularly people in the poorest country in the world, if they had had gold for the last century, it would be almost trivial for people to be able to secure a modern house with electricity and running hot water as a basic infrastructure! I think the upside of where we would be is almost unimaginable for people in our position! [45:29] But I think the bare minimum would be that: basic technology would be far cheaper all over the world and far more easily available because people could afford them! It\u2019s not that expensive to build an engine that gives you 24-hour electricity! It\u2019s a really simple engineering problem that\u2019s been solved in many places in the world for many many decades. And it just keeps getting cheaper every year! I think the reason that so many people in the world don\u2019t have it is because they have bad money that just continues to lose value. And it ruins their time preference as we were saying earlier! It prevents them from thinking of the future."}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [46:03]: One thing that\u2019s interesting to me is: in the perfect gold standard, the store of value is a gold coin and the medium of exchange is the silver coin. As I read The Fiat Standard, I see we kind of had to abandon the gold standard because we needed faster money and we needed larger quantities of it! You know, we replaced the gold standard with this network of tens of thousands of banks and hundreds of central banks and armies of accountants and lawyers and bureaucrats! The currency was the medium of exchange, the store of value when the fiat system worked \u2014 first they tried the store of value as gold \u2014 it seems like they layered on fiat currency over gold to try to do that, and then over time as the gold got seized and it was synthetic gold or hypothecated gold, and then in 1971 the semblance of that started breaking down and then the store of value in the fiat system was sovereign debt! If we look at the world today, there\u2019s all the currency, and the theoretical store of value, right? If you ask a corporate treasurer, What are you gonna do with your treasury, I need to store my value? Well I don\u2019t hold my cash outright, I would hold it in government debt \u2014 treasuries were the gold. The gold standard is treasuries! And that kind of worked! For example, the currency system \u2014 international currency trading \u2014 used to kind of work! There was price discovery in the market! For example, you remember when Greek debt was trading like 8, 9, 10%, and I remember Spanish debt or Italian debt used to trade 5\u20136%. I would say if you go back to before the EU was formed and you had all these countries with all their different currencies, the currencies were in a competitive market, and if a country wanted to keep its currency from collapsing, you had to raise the interest rate! So you remember when people used to have 12% interest rates and 8% \u2014 under the Volcker regime, we go back to the \u201980s: you had Ronald Reagan \u2014 he was fairly conservative, Volcker was conservative. There you had the fiat standard, but they took the interest rates to 18% in the US! The thinking was, countries had to compete to make the currency viable: you had to have interest rates that were market-set, and in that world you have 8% 30-year bonds and you had 5% bonds. In 2010, short-term interest rates were 5%! So you remember you were saying, Well the money supply was expanding at 7\u20138%, maybe 7% or something! In that world, if I\u2019m a corporate treasurer, I can get 5\u20136% on bonds. Call it credit-worthy bonds, AAA credit. The store of value in the fiat system, when it works \u2014 and we\u2019ll go back to good ole days, Ronald Reagan when it was the good ole days \u2014 when it works you buy credit-grade bonds, AAA-rated, you buy sovereign debt, it yields 4, 5, 6%, the money supply expands either 3% or 7%, say it\u2019s expanding at 7\u20138%, you\u2019re getting a 1\u20132% loss, I give you $100 Million \u2014 the half-life of the money is 35 years! So in that world, you can have \u2014 by the way, 35 years or 30 years is kind of a magic number, it\u2019s your career, Saifedean \u2014 so if I\u2019m a CEO or I\u2019m a corporate treasurer and I\u2019m running on the fiat standard in that time period, I can take my capital, I can put it into like credit-worthy bonds, not take a lot of execution risk, not try to guess what happens with Zoom versus Tesla and I\u2019m not \u201cspeculating,\u201d right? The fiat standard, when it works, gives you sovereign debt and credit instruments that allow me as a responsible corporate treasurer to protect the assets of the company for the next 20\u201330 years, long enough for the company to execute its business strategy. That used to work! But then something started breaking down in the last 30 years! And today it\u2019s busted! There\u2019s no price discovery, sovereign debt is not a store of value! Last week the junk bond index dipped below 5%, it was 4.9%! Okay? The theoretical risk of junk bonds, the risk of default to anybody is 4%, but to a rational person it feels like it\u2019s 8%! It\u2019s 4\u20138%, is the risk on the bond, which means that if you\u2019re getting 4% yield, you\u2019re at best zero and at worst, it\u2019s a negative real yield of 4% or something after credit adjustment! So that tells you that corporate bonds, sovereign debt, and junk bonds are no longer stores of value. And the currencies yield no interest! The US 30-year swap was 72 basis points a year ago. Today, it\u2019s 175\u2013180 basis points! And that\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get! [51:34] The EU 30-year swap is 20 basis points. It\u2019s nothing! There\u2019s no yield! So what can you say? You can say: the fiat standard has broken down starting the year 2020, because at this point there is no tangible store of value where all the traditional treasury instruments are no longer stores of value! Now, when did it start? And I\u2019m going over this in my head \u2014 forgive me, I read your book, you got me thinking, I\u2019m literally thinking about this this morning but I\u2019m thinking \u2014 I\u2019m thinking it started to break down with the Japanese in 1980s. I think the Japanese had a crisis, the crisis was: the digital revolution, computer chip came out, Intel, Microsoft \u2014 the Japanese dominate analog electronics, the world shifts to digital electronics, their exports start slipping, and as the world moves to the Computer Age, the Japanese economy weakens. Their reaction is: the central bank starts to intervene. They\u2019re a closed system and authoritarian, a single government in a closed system under economic crisis. And so they start buying everything, price discovery disappears, asset inflation goes through the roof, real estate in Tokyo goes through the roof, zombie companies start to manifest themselves, the economy freezes! And that\u2019s the first place you start to see the breakdown of the fiat standard! The interest rate goes to laughable numbers! Non-competitive, and it\u2019s like this self-referential closed system \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever! And America looks at it and in America we have 18% interest rates, you know? And so the Japanese response was central bank intervention, and they were the first major country. Maybe not the first, because I\u2019m not a student of China and every other country. I just noticed in Japan. Then what happens next, America has the Reagan revolution and so Reagan and Volcker really define the game plan until 1988. And we have the fiat system lurching toward normal \u2014 you had savings accounts that yield 6, 7, 8% interest! You know, the way you know that there\u2019s a semblance of normalcy is: checking accounts yield 0% and savings accounts yield 8% interest and the banking system offers those things! You know, a savings account allows me to save money! If the money supply\u2019s debasing at 7% a year, the savings account is yielding 7% interest, there\u2019s some hope! When I was a kid, there was hope! And then Clinton came in and Clinton inherited a great economy and Microsoft\u2019s killing it and there\u2019s the Internet revolution and Google and Apple \u2014 this is the rise of America and all of a sudden we thought the Japanese were gonna own everything in America! They were buying the Rockefeller Center, Sony was crushing everybody, etc. So we lurched in 1980, an inflection point! America got its mojo back and we thought technology and the Internet \u2014 that makes us leaders! We didn\u2019t think we were world economic leaders when Reagan was elected! I mean, people really thought the Japanese, they were setting up Toyota plants, there\u2019s a movie Gung Ho \u2014 we thought we were gonna be working for the Japanese! [54:54] The world took a left turn, the Japanese economy missed the digital revolution, and I think this is deep-seated in the Japanese language. It\u2019s a pictographic language, that they didn\u2019t have the programming skills. They missed the digital revolution! America started to rise, the rise of Western Europe, the US started to prosper from digital productivity. And Clinton inherited this very healthy economy from Reagan, and Clinton was kind of a moderate. And we went on to 2000. And what happens in 2000? The EU! And before the EU you had all these different currencies and when you crossed Europe, every currency had to have its own interest rate and its own bank, and they\u2019re competitive with each other! And if a currency prints too much, their currency crashes and no one\u2019s gonna save them! And so there are interest rates! Go look at the interest rates \u2014 they\u2019re real interest rates! It was like a 7%, a 6%, an 8%! Right? There are consequences to irrationality under the fiat standard when there\u2019s 100 central banks and they\u2019re all competing! And you talked about it in your book: there\u2019s all these central banks! The US as a currency swap was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t 87% or 90% of all currency \u2014 it was like 30%! You can see this manifest itself in 1980, because when you had different currency systems \u2014 the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indian, South America, the German bank, the U.K., the French, the US \u2014 they\u2019re all different currency systems. And the US had to raise their interest rates, and there are consequences to our inflation! We had to take our interest rates to 18\u201319% to actually fix that problem! We couldn\u2019t print money with impunity! It\u2019s like pissing in your own bath tub! It\u2019s a small bath tub, and there are consequences to foiling your own bath tub, but when it\u2019s a big ocean, there are no consequences and you feel like you can \u2014 if you print $1 Trillion in a $10 Trillion economy that\u2019s a problem. And if you print $1 Trillion in a $50 Trillion global economy that\u2019s 2%, right? That just goes away! So in 1980, you couldn\u2019t do it! And we started lurching toward globalism, and then the EU was this big change! And what happened? Well the EU came with a light hand, but it was a massive increase in governmental authority and fiat authority. Because now you\u2019ve got an EU central bank! In my opinion, the biggest beneficiary of the EU? When the EU formed, the biggest beneficiary was the US! Because you saw every local country \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Here\u2019s what I saw: when I traveled through Europe in the \u201990s, there were 10 languages \u2014 the menus were in 10 different languages \u2014 10 different currencies, I have to change money at every border, I started with $1,000, I ended with the equivalent of $780 or $900, the money-changing was expensive, and I couldn\u2019t read the street signs! When you travel through Europe after the formation of the EU, all the menus converted to English, EU adopted English as the second language, you converted to the Euro, and if you\u2019re living in Portugal or France or Spain you\u2019re thinking, Well I had to give up Portuguese and Spanish and Italian for English! And I had to give up the peseta and the lira for the Euro, but I might as well just convert it to the dollar! The Italians aren\u2019t gonna adopt French! And so it\u2019s almost like all the Europeans agreed to adopt English, and then they started pegging to the dollar! And the US was the big beneficiary of the formation of the EU, because now everybody had to accept English and the dollar, and that played into TCP/IP and the Internet, and Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and the entire US economy benefited! And it was US San Francisco progressive views, San Francisco technology, US law. The American legal and economic and cultural system encroached on Europe in a big way! We saw the formation of a Western Europe and the United States, a billion-person trading bloc trading in dollars, convertible dollars trading in English language subject to basically US trade law! So what happened next? Well, the EU was weak, and there was a crisis, and it used to be that, if I wanted to buy Italian bonds I could get 7\u20138% yield, and the German bond yield was 2%. And the Germans had the best credit rating and the French were next, but the Portuguese had a weaker one and the Italians had an awful credit rating and their bonds yielded great! And the Greeks, at some point \u2014 you could probably go back and pull the bond yields, it probably tells the story of the death of the fiat standard, right? Or the encroachment of the fiat standard! If you look at bond yields in European countries from 2000-on, there\u2019s a point at which they all pretty much pegged to the EU bond yield, and that was as the EU central banks started taking responsibility for the default of the Greeks. The Greek crisis was probably a seminal event! [1:00:56] When the EU bailed out Greece, that was an expansion of the EU central bank! I almost think about two crises: we had the Great Financial Crisis, when the United States bailed out every bank, and we forced them all to take hundreds of billions of dollars, and we bailed out every European bank with US dollars! And it seems like once we did that, we owned them all! Like, the US dollar as the world reserve currency, it went from being 30% to 40% to 60% to 80% to 90% after that crisis! And it seems like after the debt crisis of Greece, and after the Italian debt crisis when the EU central bank bailed out those countries, the EU kind of owned them as well! The summary is: by the time this is all said and done, interest rates in the European Union have crashed to zero, short-term interest rates are negative, long-term interest rates were like 8 basis points for 30-year money on a swap a few weeks ago! And so what you really got is the massive expansion of the EU central bank and the Fed from the year 2000 to the year 2020. And as they expanded, all corporate debt, all sovereign debt, stopped being an effective store of value! The currencies became dominant and for whatever reason, the US currency just got progressively stronger and stronger from 1980 to the year 2020! And now the entire transformation has taken its hold!"}

They\u2019re actually charging like \u2014 they\u2019re offering 15 basis points yield and charging 25 basis points management fee! The literal fee is higher than the yield on the account! The marketplace has migrated, and it\u2019s being forced. And stage one was gold, stage two was sovereign debt, and then the rise of corporate, AAA-rated debt. You could almost say that in order to replace the gold standard, we had to have an army of credit rating agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s and S&P and you could say the rise of the junk bond market might be explained by this! \u2014 people desperately chasing after store of value without equity risk. Finally they threw in the towel and they started absorbing some equity risk! And then in 2020, we kind of kicked the thing into high gear, right? March of 2020 is the point where everything just breaks! Like, because 5, 6, 7% money expansion against an 8% S&P index and against a 5% bond yield or 4% credit worthy yield and 8\u201310% junk bond yield \u2014 you can sort of almost make that work, but it stops working when the money supply expands by 25% and the S&P yield is 15% and the junk bond yield is 4%, and the sovereign yield is 0\u20131%!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: I think right now the only two store of values \u2014 the people are smarter in some ways than the politicians and mainstream media, because even the 23-year old Uber driver knows that they\u2019re probably better off to buy Tesla stock or to buy a market basket of technology stocks, or even take a flyer on GameStop, or buy Bitcoin, than they are to put their money in a savings account and wait! I think that what\u2019s happened is, people have migrated, smart money has determined that there\u2019s only two stores of value left! Really smart money that\u2019s brave says, Bitcoin! If you\u2019re really progressive and if you\u2019ve got some courage, then you realize that the best store of value is Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s digital gold! The other layer of smart money that is either very comfortable \u2014 they\u2019re already wealthy, they\u2019ve got plenty of money and they\u2019re comfortable or they\u2019re conventional \u2014 the comfortable, conventional smart money has decided that Big Tech or growth is the store of value. And the best surrogate for that is NASDAQ. If I go right now case for Bitcoin, and I look, what does that show me? ROI 1-year it\u2019s saying Bitcoin is 356% up, NASDAQ is up 43%, gold is up 14.7%, S&P is up 16%, and treasuries are 2%, and your money expansion was 25% or whatever you want to plug in! And if you plug in 15% going forward you can see you\u2019ll tread water with gold and S&P \u2014 maybe! I wouldn\u2019t [with gold]! I think that you\u2019re more likely to tread water with the S&P. I think with gold, gold is in a ballistic trajectory \u2014 it got a boost in the crisis \u2014 now it\u2019s losing momentum, it\u2019s broken down in the last 6 months and it\u2019s about to crash! And you\u2019re going to see people short gold, reallocate from gold, the price is gonna crash! And it\u2019s probably the scariest possible investment right now, because gold only exists as long as people are looking for a non-sovereign store of value, and you only need one, right? And there\u2019s only one that can be! And you pretty much have to be brain-dead to be allocating to gold versus Bitcoin in the year 2021! You\u2019re just gonna have to go through like mental gymnastics! So I can buy the argument that I buy a market basket of all the stocks, because you\u2019re just buying the economy, but I can\u2019t really buy the argument of gold anymore! And of course, treasuries are disasters because you\u2019re long money \u2014 not only are you taking on cash that\u2019s losing 15% of its purchasing power a year, you\u2019re locking yourself in for 20\u201330 year duration! By the time you get the cash back you\u2019re going to have lost 95% of your money, so that\u2019s just foolish! But you\u2019ve got growth, right? Everybody wants growth! They\u2019ll take growth discounting risk to zero! They\u2019ll even take the prospect of growth, right? Like if you just tell me a story, and if I can\u2019t have growth then they\u2019ll buy GameStop because at least there\u2019s the potential of \u2014 if I can\u2019t have growth, I\u2019ll take speculation of growth, and if I can\u2019t have speculation of growth, I\u2019ll just take speculation of a short squeeze! All of those are more compelling than anything left in the fiat system!"}

So the interesting thing will be to see how this develops! Now you\u2019ve been saying that you don\u2019t think Bitcoin threatens the dollar. So would you say that Bitcoin threatens treasuries, but doesn\u2019t threaten the dollar and therefore we can continue to see maybe just more inflation in the dollar, but governments continue turning value against Bitcoin and continue to collect taxes from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin replaces their treasuries, puts them on a tight leash, and makes their inflation a little bit more transparent, but their dollar continues to survive! Is that how you see it?"}

It\u2019s a crypto-anarchist idea! I could be more supportive of Bitcoin replacing the Zimbabwe dollar, or the Venezuelan Bolivar! Like, in a government where all of the institutions of government have broken down, an utterly corrupt, dysfunctional government where they can\u2019t function anymore, and that\u2019s a hyper-inflationary environment \u2014 I\u2019d probably be more supportive of that! Because there, people are going to starve to death! So there\u2019s billions of people in collapsing economies where the currency is collapsing. There, some kind of stable currency \u2014 it might be even a stablecoin like the US dollar sitting on a crypto-rail backed by Bitcoin, which might be what Tether is or what something is \u2014 I think that that\u2019s probably got a value, that\u2019s probably got a place! But in the United States and in Europe, as the fiat currency expands, it maintains its place as a medium of exchange and a lawful currency and as legal currency. And it will, and we should hope it will, because I don\u2019t think anybody wants France or Germany or the US to look like Zimbabwe, right? I mean those are literally countries where the rule of law and the right to property break down! When the rule of law and your right to freedom of speech or the right to life, liberty, and property break down, you\u2019ve got a situation of true anarchy! And then \u2014 I suppose if you\u2019re a crypto-anarchist and you support reinstalling free speech and right to property via a crypto network \u2014 I get that! That makes sense! But in a country that has a rule of law and a right to property, the logical thing that happens is, when people lose faith in the currency, they migrate to gold! When gold isn\u2019t fast enough \u2014 by the way, gold is an antiquated, elitist asset! I mean, the criticism of gold that people should focus on is that it\u2019s elitist! How do 500 million people buy $1,700 worth of gold? Calculate: what is the mark up on $1,700 worth of gold coins purchased $87 at a time, right? Isn\u2019t that like 40% mark up? Like, aren\u2019t you looking at \u2014 I mean elitist is, I\u2019m gonna basically pay double! I mean even coins are expensive! If you want to get gold at a reasonable price you have to buy a bar of London good delivery gold, which is 400 ounces at a time \u2014 that\u2019s $800,000 blocks of gold\u2014and you probably have to buy five of them from J.P. Morgan to get treated anywhere close to reasonably, right? So gold is an elitist store of value. It is not accessible to the billion people in the Western world \u2014 in Western Europe and the US! It\u2019s certainly not accessible to the 7.8 Billion people on the planet! And so, if you\u2019re going to deliver a store of value to everybody with a mobile phone on Earth, Bitcoin is your best bet! Bitcoin is gonna be running transaction fees of less than 1%. 1\u20132% would be high, you know? Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be nothing compared to the cost to acquire and store and maneuver gold! Gold is elitist and gold is antiquated, because I can\u2019t move $37 worth of gold from point A to point B to pay for an Uber ride! I can\u2019t fund with gold! Gold is not bankable! Gold is slow money. With Bitcoin, we\u2019re on the verge of a world where you\u2019ll have $1 Trillion of Bitcoin\u2014you can plug a billion consumer accounts into it and you can offer people the ability to borrow against the Bitcoin at 4% interest! J.P. Morgan offers you securitized loans up to loan-to-value 50% against conventional assets at LIBOR +50 basis points if you\u2019re an institutional customer! You could get LIBOR +200 basis points if you were a consumer! You\u2019re talking about 2\u20133% interest! So in a world where a major bank were to plug into Bitcoin, there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t get to a point where a billion people could borrow money against Bitcoin at 2% and then never sell the Bitcoin forever! I think in the next 36 months we\u2019ll see 4\u20135% consumer loans against Bitcoin! When\u2019s the last time you got a loan against gold? No! And then we\u2019re onto this next thing which is, Okay, we\u2019ll write off gold. Well what\u2019s next? Bond indexes? No. So we migrate to stock indexes! I think the free market in the Western world is inventing asset classes to serve as stores of value, and they\u2019ve been doing them legally and ethically, and the government allows you to create asset classes! I mean, when $1 Trillion moved into the Vanguard 500, the S&P 500, the government didn\u2019t block that! So I think that the right way to think about it is: Bitcoin as a store of value asset class, as digital gold, growing to be $10 Trillion, and then $20 Trillion and then $40 Trillion. The big model I have is a monetary planet. And let\u2019s say the monetary planet is $500 Trillion, it\u2019s a gaseous planet! The outside of it is $100 Trillion worth of M2 or M3 money \u2014 currency, derivatives and the like \u2014 Euros, Dollars, etc. And so that\u2019s currency that\u2019s moving through all the governments on Earth, and that\u2019s gonna continue as long as there are governments on Earth! Then inside of that is $400 Trillion worth of other assets, and it\u2019s broken up between real estate and collectibles and stocks and credit instruments and bonds and derivatives. $350 Trillion of the $400 Trillion \u2014 I dunno, maybe it\u2019s not that \u2014 maybe $200 Trillion of the $400 Trillion is what I\u2019ll call currency derivatives! Their value is based substantially or in part on the discounted value of the future cash flows of the asset. So stock\u2019s valued on future cash flows, commercial real estate\u2019s valued on future cash flows, and bonds valued on future cash flows. Those are currency derivatives. Now inside that is a higher quality set of assets \u2014 I\u2019m gonna call them trophy assets, collectible assets! A beach house in the Hamptons, Palm Beach, a Picasso \u2014 even a trophy equity, to the extent that own Disney because I love Disney, because I love Mickey Mouse, because Mickey Mouse was part of my formative experiences! A trophy piece of debt, it\u2019s a piece of debt for the Children\u2019s Hospital in my neighborhood because they saved my kid\u2019s life. Like something that you would hold and you would value because it\u2019s part of your self-identity! A football team, a soccer franchise \u2014 things that people love and they would hold them irregardless of the forecast of the discounted cash flows into the future. Your personal home \u2014 your personal home has value to you, your personal car, your personal yacht, your personal plane! These things have value to you because you love them and they will be pried from your cold, dead fingers! And it doesn\u2019t matter what the interest rate is \u2014 it\u2019s your house! It\u2019s your lake house! So that stuff is a harder asset. And then in the middle of that is a $10 Trillion hardcore gold which we\u2019ll call non-sovereign store of value fungible money. And inside that, in this burning red-hot thing at the center of the Earth \u2014 that\u2019s crypto! There\u2019s a Trillion-dollar crypto fire in the middle of the $500 Trillion planet! And that Trillion-dollar crypto fire was started from a spark by Satoshi, and it\u2019s burning and it went from a Billion to $10 Billion to $100 Billion to a Trillion \u2014 the Bitcoin fire! And that is the hardest, fastest, smartest, strongest monetary asset in the history of the human race! And it is expanding and it is boiling these things, and it is boiling gold! And the first thing it\u2019s gonna do is it\u2019s gonna replace gold, and gold will collapse into the crypto fire! And then it will suck in sovereign credit instruments, negative-yielding sovereign debt, to the extent that that\u2019s held as a store of value! It will subsume some debt indexes and some equity indexes. And it\u2019ll probably expand from $10 Trillion to $20 to $40, $80, $100 Trillion, and it could get all the way to say $200 Trillion, and when it\u2019s $200 Trillion, it\u2019ll be the stabilizing framework and the gaseous monetary planet will go from $500 Trillion up by 10% to $550, maybe it\u2019s +15% a year, right? If it\u2019s +15% a year, your $500 Trillion monetary planet will expand to become an $800-$900 Trillion \u2014 what\u2019s after a trillion, is it a quad \u2014"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: We\u2019re headed toward a Quadrillion \u2014 a Quad planet! And Bitcoin will expand at 250%-300% a year\u2014for the last decade \u2014 and that\u2019s about as fast as it can go, because anything faster than that rips the wings off the airplane! People ask, How fast can human beings accept change? I think, if you look at the history of business, companies growing faster than 200% a year are rare! I mean, that\u2019s pretty much as fast as it can go! So it\u2019ll go 200%, and it\u2019ll track that way, and then I think at some point when it crosses gold, it\u2019ll slow down to 150% and 120% \u2014 you could probably work it out over the next 20 years as it goes from a Trillion to $200 Trillion! It might take 30 years. It might take 20 years. It might take 10 years. Somewhere between 10\u201330 years, right? If you look at the rate. And where we\u2019re headed is: a world where there\u2019s 8 billion people on the planet with a mobile phone, and those 8 billion people are storing value in digital gold, and probably that mobile device is gonna have a hardware wallet embedded in it that\u2019s gonna be the token, and you\u2019ll have multi-signature multi-hardware wallets securing digital gold which has become \u2014 I dunno what is it gonna be, a third, or half? \u2014 you have to ask the question theoretically, Saifedean! What portion of the monetary planet should rationally be store of value? And I think it\u2019s self-equibilating, because as more monetary energy \u2014 it\u2019s like magnetism, you\u2019re de-magnetizing something, you\u2019re de-monetizing something! \u2014 as more monetary energy falls off of gold and off of silver and then off of indexes into Bitcoin, price discovery will return to these other assets! So price discovery\u2019s gonna return to gold and it\u2019s gonna return to its ornamental and antique value! And price discovery will return to silver, and price discovery will return to stocks and bonds. What you can assume is that in a free market, price discovery will return, the bond prices will fall, the yields will increase, real estate prices will fall, the yields will increase for commercial real estate, you will see stock prices fall, dividend yields and yields will increase \u2014 everything will rationalize in a free market. Market dynamics, conventional market theory dictates that: no asset can be any more attractive than any other asset in a free market, because capital will flow and migrate so as to equalize the expected return on all assets! Now what you\u2019re gonna see is certain markets become not free! The way you break that is you pass laws! The extreme cases will what you\u2019re seeing going on in India right now. What you saw in China makes it impossible to convert your RMB into Bitcoin. And India\u2019s threatened by it, Nigeria\u2019s threatened by it. You\u2019re gonna see back and forth, and you\u2019ll see some countries will embrace it and other countries will run from it! But you know, the Chinese made Google, Twitter\u2019s illegal, Facebook\u2019s illegal, right? That\u2019s gonna happen! And it didn\u2019t stop them from being successful other places! I think you\u2019ll probably see the Western world will embrace digital gold, I think you\u2019ll see banana republics, corrupt regimes, attempt to resist it! On the other hand, I\u2019ve traveled all through China and everybody\u2019s got a VPN and they\u2019re looking at Twitter and Facebook accounts with VPNs! It\u2019s really difficult \u2014 can they actually stop it? Not really, right? I mean they can\u2019t stop it, they actually have a hard time stopping money traveling on crypto rails over VPNs and the TOR network. On the other hand, will they suffer from it? Yeah! There\u2019s a big cost to not have Google! I mean there\u2019s a big cost to not have YouTube, right? There\u2019s a big cost to not have electricity! There\u2019s costs to reject technology! If your money moves a million times faster, then that means the cost of capital for the world that embraces the technology drops, and that means that innovation accelerates! And you can cling to your gold coins and your giant stone coins of the Yap people and whatever, but at some point \u2014 there\u2019s a cost not having Google Maps, man! Cars that don\u2019t drive themselves, you know? There\u2019s a cost! And eventually it reflects itself in the Cuba standard of living, or the North Korean standard of living, and even the Chinese can\u2019t necessarily stop this thing! So bottom line is: I think the fiat system is going to continue as a currency, and it should! The currency rails work fine! What people still haven\u2019t got through their head is, I could have 150% of my assets in Bitcoin! You can have a million dollars, you can buy $1 Million in Bitcoin, you can mortgage your house, buy another $500,000 in Bitcoin, you could take out a personal loan against your future earnings if you\u2019re a doctor \u2014 buy another $500k in Bitcoin! If it was me, I\u2019d mortgage my house, I\u2019d sell my gold, and I would raise debt and I would buy Bitcoin! You can have 100% of your assets in Bitcoin, get a bank that will give you a loan against Bitcoin, if Bitcoin is going up at 25% a year, and if your expenses are going up at 5% a year, you can borrow money to pay for your coffee and to pay your rent and to drive your car and to live your life forever!\u2014 never pay it back \u2014 keep the Bitcoin, and your debt-to-equity ratio will fall! And so at some point you could literally fund everything in Bitcoin, and so you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar is my point! You don\u2019t really want to spend Bitcoin! What you want to do, is you want to plug your Bitcoin account into a Visa card, and you want to pay for things with Visa, and you want to run up a debt, and you never want to pay it off, and you want to die owing money! It\u2019s not that complicated! You have a million dollars and it doubles every year \u2014 you eventually have $100 Million, you can spend $100,000 a year going up at 20% a year, or you can spend $100,000 going up at 50% a year, and you will die with $90 Million of equity, $10 Million in debt, never having paid tax! And you don\u2019t need to replace the Euro, you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar, you don\u2019t need to get rid of your Visa card, right? Those things don\u2019t matter!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [1:28:23]: Yeah I think another argument in favor of this is the fact that maybe Bitcoin is actually reducing the demand for the creation of dollars and Euros because if people don\u2019t buy as many treasuries as they do, then fewer dollars are created. People don\u2019t get into as much debt, and fewer dollars are created. And so if people are holding Bitcoin instead of holding debt instruments on their balance sheet then less debt takes places, and the key concept in The Fiat Standard is that fiat is debt. So basically Bitcoin reduces the demand and the supply for fiat! But I guess it\u2019s unfortunately it\u2019s not a choice we get to make, it\u2019s an outcome of markets. So the question is: Can the dollar hold on? And can printing the dollar manage to maintain the Bitcoin storm? I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see! But there are reasons why we can see Bitcoin continue to grow without the dollar having to collapse. I\u2019ve got another question for you, switching gears a little bit: you waltzed into the Bitcoin world at a very very good time, you know! You came in at what was it $7, $8, $9,000, and within a couple of weeks we are now almost at $50,000 \u2014 it\u2019s at $47,000 I think right now. Obviously part of that is probably you and the impact that you have had \u2014 all the evangelism that you\u2019ve done! But also, we\u2019ve had periods in Bitcoin before where prices have declined for quite a while, so if this was high school, you would be signing up for high school the week of the prom and the graduation! You didn\u2019t sit with us through the dark days of holding the \u2014 buying the $1,000 top and watching it go down to $150 over two years! So I\u2019m wondering: you went in at a time where this was a possibility! We could have had another two years, you know? You may have chanced upon Bitcoin in 2018 and Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed much between 2018 and 2020, but if you bought in March 2018 you would\u2019ve witnessed the decline for quite a while! So I\u2019m wondering, was your entry, were you just thinking, Alright, this is now better technology \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna be buying as much as I can! Or was there some kind of price analysis going on in a sense of, We\u2019ve consolidated for a while, so most likely we\u2019re gonna be getting another jump! Would you have bought as aggressively in 2018? And do you follow any particular models for thinking about the price?"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: When I look back at my life, I can count all sorts of fortunate occurrences \u2014 so I\u2019m lucky! Second, I think the best time in human history to buy Bitcoin was starting in March of 2020! If you want to look at this entire thing\u2014starting from March of 2020 the world changed forever! That was the risk/reward point where the risk had diminished by 99%, and the return and the use case had amped by a factor of 100! It was an inflection point in March of 2020! Look, I wouldn\u2019t have bought it at all in February of 2020! I didn\u2019t know it existed \u2014 I didn\u2019t really care to think about it! The world was totally different in February versus in April, so I think March is the beginning of the new era. I think that people in the Bitcoin industry, I think to a certain degree, they\u2019re biased by their history, and it\u2019s a liability for them. I think it\u2019s baggage that they should lose! I think that most people in the Bitcoin industry \u2014 most people in business, most people in life, they want to draw on their experience, because there\u2019s a bias that, I want to make decisions based on my experience, and I want to feel that everything that I experienced was worthwhile! And if I felt pain, I would like for it to have meant something, right? So what if I looked at you and I said, Saif, nothing that you experienced between 2010\u20132020 was relevant! And you could basically flush it all down the toilet and take a clean sheet of paper and start again! That doesn\u2019t feel good! Right? Psychologically it\u2019s hard to let go of that, but let me give you an example of inflection point: for 10 years before March [2020], we had tried to use video conferencing and I used Webex. And my experiences were uniformly awful for the entire 10 years! I could probably write a book on all of the bad meetings and all of the awful dysfunctional business results that came from that, and I fired people that wanted to use video conferencing and wanted to work remotely the previous year! Okay? And I had lots of experience! And then in March we decided to use Zoom and Zoom was 100x better, and I had only good experiences! And the truth of the matter is, the entire decade of experience that I had with video conferencing was of no value whatsoever! It actually just saddled me with a prejudicial bias because I had scars and I had pain, and it\u2019s all irrelevant! So after March, everybody on Earth needed Bitcoin! 1,000 companies! You heard Ross last week, he said, I had 20 clients at the beginning of the year, I had 280 institutional clients at the end of the year, I have 90 in the pipeline now. Ross will have 1,000 clients! He\u2019ll go from 20 to 1,000! All of his experience before March, all of your forecasts before March \u2014 irrelevant! It\u2019s what I said to Keith McCullough, All your models \u2014 destroyed! Why are they destroyed? Because they\u2019re based upon the statistical interaction. A tidal wave hits the beach! Okay? I drop a bomb on your head! Your entire history living in the town or playing on the beach \u2014 irrelevant! Irrelevant! You want it to matter \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! When $100 Trillion of capital comes through a nozzle \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! If you took every trade of Bitcoin from the point that Satoshi did the whatever and the pizza transfer took place, all the way through the blow-off top, all of it is irrelevant! Let me explain it a different way: if Elon Musk woke up tomorrow and decided, Screw it! I\u2019m buying $10 Billion of Bitcoin instead of $1.5 Billion of Bitcoin! That one decision renders irrelevant all of the studying of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory between today and last March! One person, one thing, makes a difference! And likewise, March rendered irrelevant the statistical models in the history before! What\u2019s going on right now is, on February 8th, on Monday, the day that you woke up, if you read the news, the world changed again! You have to keep redoing your models! The human race, I mean \u2014 read Paleo-theory: we ran around getting chased by wolves and apes for 3\u20134 Million years, starving to death! Life was difficult! And 10,000 years ago we invented agriculture \u2014 life changed again! 100 years ago \u2014 life changed again! The life of a human being today: the challenges, the dynamics \u2014 how many children get up and worry about getting eaten by a wild animal today? It\u2019s irrelevant, right? The history of the human race is irrelevant to a decision \u2014 like, you\u2019re gonna get in a car and drive the car? You can kill yourself in 3 seconds! What matters is, you\u2019re in the frickin\u2019 car! When you engineer a new system, it completely renders irrelevant your history! If I take a gun and I point it at your head\u2014and there\u2019s a bullet in it \u2014 nothing in the world that you\u2019ve lived through matters other than: can you get me to not pull the trigger? Everything else is irrelevant! And so, engineering machines, and when your circumstances change \u2014 when you\u2019re skiing down a ski-slope and there\u2019s an avalanche, all your skill as a skier \u2014 rendered irrelevant! All your skill as a human being! It\u2019s back to this issue of the guy that was the chairman of HNA \u2014 he was the richest guy in China, worth $30 Billion! 2 years ago? He went hiking in the South of France, stood on a rock wall, had a selfie taken, tripped and fell to his death! All of his money, all of his models, all of his lawyers, 87 Million frickin\u2019 people in China \u2014 irrelevant! In 1 second, he broke the law of gravity and he died! The point here is: Bitcoin has moved into a different zone, a phase shift! It was in one phase from 2010\u20132015, it went through another phase 2015\u20132018. When Bitcoin pulled ahead after the fork wars it moved into a different phase. And then in 2020 it moved into a different phase. And at the point that publicly traded companies started buying it and institutions started buying it and mainstream media started coping with it, when a Senator got elected, the mayor of Miami Beach, Senator Cynthia Lummis \u2014 when these things happen, when Gary Gensler takes his role at the SEC \u2014 you\u2019re in a different phase! And so, you have to recalibrate all of your models based upon a whole new set of assumptions. And it\u2019s like I took the spear out of your hand, I gave you a bow and arrow! The human race changed! I take your bow and arrow out of your hand, I gave you a gun! I take the gun out of your hand and I give you a bomb! As I change the engineering, the outlook changes and you cannot draw on your history anymore! You have to think differently!"}

Those shares can be sold and the price of the shares \u2014 the derivatives can go down \u2014 the underlying Bitcoin can never be sold per the charter! Ever! Ever! So you see, there are fundamental different things that are going on! Last I checked they had $30 Billion of Bitcoin. That\u2019s $30 Billion of Bitcoin that can\u2019t be sold! Okay? Held by institutions! A very different world! So these are sources of inertia falling into Bitcoin. And the volatility is not the same! If you look at the drawdowns, they\u2019re not the same.

But then one day you grow up and you have a furnace in your house, or maybe you plug into someone else\u2019s electrical system and you have an electrical heater \u2014 you\u2019re not a Boy Scout anymore! Right? It\u2019s a totally different world, and the system, the network, is much more mature, it\u2019s just much better engineered, there\u2019s much more monetary energy in it, there\u2019s much more inertia. I mean ultimately, there\u2019s massive amounts of monetary inertia in the system! It\u2019s like an air compressor. We\u2019re compressing energy in a monetary battery and it\u2019s accelerating if you look at the rate at which energy is flowing into it! And as that energy flows, it\u2019s stabilizing! So the more monetary energy flowing in the system, the more stable it is, the more inertia it is, the more difficult it is to change the direction, and the less volatility it has! And I think that you\u2019re gonna continue to see that as these banks evolve! It\u2019s very clear to me ever since March, you can literally see the volatility and the instability in the entire network being damped by rational actors!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Saifedean Ammous [1:44:13]: Let me give you my counter-case: I think ultimately, the more money comes into Bitcoin, the more the price goes up, the problem there is that you start getting more and more Bitcoin minted, so effectively Bitcoin becomes more inflationary as the price rises and I think this might be why the halving dynamic always will have a big rise but also a crash, because over the past 4 years in the previous halving period we had 4 years in which we were making 1,800 Bitcoins a day worth on average 7, 8, $9,000, so you had about $14 Million a day of new Bitcoins being produced! So for the price to hold around that level, we had to have $14 Million of new demand a day. Now, there\u2019s only so much more the demand can increase! There will come a point in which the demand goes up, and so the price goes up, and then the price of the new coins that\u2019ll be mined is also going up massively, so then the new supply becomes bigger than the demand \u2014 the demand can\u2019t keep up with the supply, and you witness an inflection because there\u2019s also a lot of leverage! A lot of people that are leveraged in so they get wiped out and then the technicals of the chart turn, and then we can have another big drawdown! What do you think?"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [1:45:30]: I\u2019m not really a big believer in the halvings as being a driver going forward! Again I think that all of these models are mental models that were formed in the early years, and I think that you should throw them all out! And you should start to reason from first principles and build a new model! For example: I\u2019m staring at the screen of Binance right now! The 24-hour volume of BTC is 93,000 coins on Binance. If you double it, that means there\u2019s probably 180,000 coins traded today! 900 Bitcoin is irrelevant! The amount of Bitcoin being created is so de minimis compared to the volume of the trading, it\u2019s irrelevant! And also, I think it\u2019s irrelevant to any rational investor! It\u2019s just irrelevant to me! For example: there\u2019s 21 Million fully-diluted Bitcoins! Done! End of Story! Like, I don\u2019t care at what point they get printed because \u2014 again, what\u2019s the ratio of 93,000 to 900? The amount of Bitcoin getting mined is 50 basis points! It\u2019s half of a percent! Like when we\u2019re doing a trade, we pay half a percent as the fee! Like, people with serious amounts of money \u2014 they\u2019re gonna blow through this! They don\u2019t care! What matters a lot more than all of these concerns about the halving is if Paul Tudor Jones wakes up and decides to double his allocation from 1% to 2%? Or from 2% to 4%? That matters more than all of these other things, because the demand is excessive! So I think a better way to look at it is, it\u2019s emerging as an asset class like the S&P 500 index. And when it gets to be $10 Trillion or $5 Trillion or $3 Trillion just like the index, there\u2019s so much money coming in and going out of it that it\u2019s stabilizing the index, and it takes \u2014 if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class like gold, it would take a Trillion dollars! Why do you think I didn\u2019t buy gold? It\u2019s because I said, Well it\u2019s gonna take $20 Trillion to drive gold up by a factor of 10! How much does it really take, right? If you have a Trillion dollar asset class, then a Trillion dollars will probably drive it up by a factor of 10. Like if you double the demand? Maybe more! But if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class, a Trillion dollars drives it up by a factor of 2, maybe, or 50%. So as it gets more monetary energy, the inertial component gets greater, the liquidity gets greater! I really think for institutional investors, the halving just doesn\u2019t matter anymore! The dynamic that matters is \u2014 another example: if Dan Schulman wakes up tomorrow and says, I think I should put Bitcoin on PayPal\u2019s balance sheet! Dan Schulman has a $300 Billion company! He could put $10 Billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet! When Coinbase becomes public, they might be worth $100 Billion! If the CEO of Coinbase decides to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet, he could put a Billion on the balance sheet! $2\u20133 Billion! The decisions of individuals! Ray Dalio is giving a speech at ConsenSys. Ray Dalio\u2019s got $150 Billion of assets under management. If he decides that Bitcoin is 25% as good as gold, won\u2019t they buy like $10 Billion of it? Ray Dalio, Brian Armstrong, Dan Shulman, right? Individuals! There\u2019s probably 10,000 people in the world that have the ability to put a Billion dollars on the network! 10,000! And there\u2019s 1,000\u20132,000 that have the ability to put $10 Billion on the network! Again, every model that you have and all the history that we have is all irrelevant if any of them act! The actors, the actions that get taken place obsolesce and they overwhelm any statistical models, because the statistical models are based upon \u2014 like if you told me \u2014 for example, in 2018 you have a bunch of Bitcoin and crypto traders that are trading with leverage that have no banks, they can\u2019t borrow money against their Bitcoin, okay? Those people have a very short time preference, Saifedean! You\u2019re the time guy, right? The people that have the shortest time preference I\u2019ve found are crypto traders! I mean, they\u2019re thinking about whether or not it\u2019s trading down in the next 8 hours, right? So when I ask people, Why don\u2019t you put 100% of your assets into Bitcoin they say, Well I need money to live on! Well why don\u2019t you just borrow money? Who\u2019s gonna loan me money? BlockFi! Oh BlockFi, they charge 12%, 10%, right? So there\u2019s a very embryonic industry right now\u2014the consumer banking industry that\u2019s banking Bitcoin. By the way: name 5 companies that\u2019ll give you $100 Million loan against Bitcoin? Name 5. Can you? No! No! It\u2019s embryonic! I can name 5 that\u2019ll give me a $100 Million loan against Apple stock! Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley \u2014 everybody! Okay? And here\u2019s my point: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to change! What\u2019s changing is the banks! The banks are changing! NYDIG will give you a loan! Genesis will give you a loan! When Coinbase will give you a loan \u2014 Binance is rolling out some credit products. PayPal won\u2019t give you a loan yet, but what happens when PayPal gives 340 Million people a loan at 4% interest against Bitcoin? What happens to Bitcoin? Well, time horizons stretch out! Now I can own it for 30 years. Oh you mean I don\u2019t have to sell my Bitcoin to buy my Lamborghini? If you actually believe Bitcoin\u2019s going up by a factor of 2 every 2 years you\u2019re an idiot to sell your Bitcoin to buy your Lamborghini! The Lamborghini\u2019s gonna cost you $100 Million! Why don\u2019t you borrow the money to buy the Lamborghini and keep the Bitcoin? Well I\u2019m afraid! I\u2019m afraid of what? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna crash down by 80%. Why? Well because it did once before! Okay? So you see this circular reasoning which is: I lived in a world of crypto traders on leverage with no banking with no institutional support, and so I act. It\u2019s just like your time preference: I\u2019m afraid to plan for the future because I don\u2019t trust the money! A lot of people in their head, they think Bitcoin is volatile, I don\u2019t trust it, I won\u2019t be able to borrow against it! And that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy! There\u2019s only a certain amount of \u2014 rate\u2014at which you can change people\u2019s perceptions, right? It takes 3, 4, 5, 6 years! As the HODLers discover that they can borrow money against Bitcoin, and as the institutions come in \u2014 by the way, what\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019s famous quote? We find a company we like, our preferred holding period is forever! Is Warren Buffett still owning Coca-Cola stock? Yes! Did he sell it to buy a Lamborghini? No! Did he need to? No! Why? Because he could\u2019ve borrowed against it! Yeah! What\u2019s the impact on Coke stock? It\u2019s not so volatile! Right? Because he\u2019s a HODLer! So this is not an uncommon idea! So institutions that hold gold, how long have they been holding gold? Like, forever! What happens if you replace gold with digital gold? You hold it for 50 years! By the way, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be able to buy Bitcoin! Bitcoin below $20,000 \u2014 gone forever! Bitcoin below $30,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin below $40,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin in the $40,000\u201350,000 range? Who do you think is selling this stuff? The weak hands, with high leverage, are selling. Who do you think is buying it? Institutions! That have more money than God! That have 1,000x as much money as they\u2019re buying with this stuff. And which ones? The first 1%, just the early vanguard. So as this happens, the institutions take ownership, their time horizon is a decade. The banks come online, that means we never need to sell it ever! I mean all these guys on crypto Twitter go, Well what are you gonna do if you ever need money? And the answer is: I\u2019m never gonna need money! Right? Institutions never need money! If I ever wanted a little bit of cash, I could just borrow a little bit, but the truth of the matter is, the people buying this stuff are endowments! Harvard endowment, Yale endowment, right? So it\u2019s a different set of holders, it\u2019s a different banking relationship, it\u2019s gonna be more diffuse. As it\u2019s more diffuse, the volatility falls! You\u2019re gonna have the stories of Ruffer, Saifedean! Ruffer bought $750 Million of Bitcoin below $20,000 when it traded at $40,000 they took half off the table, so they took a $750 Million profit. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t trade up beyond $40,000! So then it traded down to $31,000. They might have bought back in, Saif! Those guys, the big institutions, they\u2019re going to be damping it on the upside, on the downside, and collaring it. And this will continue for a while! So it\u2019s a different dynamic because of the players and the capital and the banks and the security, and it\u2019s going to continue to evolve and the risk profile and the perceptions will evolve!"}

So 3% now, but if the price goes up 10-fold, if it\u2019s at $480,000, then you\u2019re doing about half a Billion of new Bitcoin being minted every day! Which is a lot of [inaudible 1:58:26]"}

It\u2019s 25 basis points right now? And my point again is: it\u2019s 25 basis points \u2014 what\u2019s the most profitable investment you can hold on your treasury? Bitcoin, right? Tell me a miner that doesn\u2019t believe in Bitcoin? The stupidest thing you can do is sell your Bitcoin! Don\u2019t sell your Bitcoin! Okay? So, what\u2019s gonna happen? I actually think you\u2019re gonna see the polarity flip on this! I think that as miners become public like Riot and Marathon, I think they\u2019re gonna think about it and they\u2019re gonna realize they should just keep mining but stop selling!

What happens if $10 Billion comes from the public markets into the Bitcoin market because these miners \u2014 I think Marathon\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap, Riot\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap \u2014 what happens if they double and they issue debt or issue equity? My point is: all your models are destroyed! Humility here is \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people here that can tip the apple cart here! So if you construct this model based upon the past, you\u2019re dismissing the actions of rational actors! It\u2019s rational for a miner to buy Bitcoin, not sell Bitcoin! It\u2019s rational for a miner to go public! It\u2019s rational for Square or PayPal to buy more Bitcoin! They might not, by the way! It\u2019s irrational not to! They might not because of volatility. How do you convince your customers to buy Bitcoin with your app when you\u2019re afraid to buy it on your balance sheet, right? Isn\u2019t there a little bit of a marketing hazard there? So there\u2019s rational actors with capital that can move this Bitcoin and they can change the volatility and they can drive it very very hard. And the only thing that keeps them from doing it is getting up in the morning and deciding they\u2019ll take a risk! If you basically bet that nobody will act rationally and nobody will take a risk, then you can run your historical models! But if I can break your model \u2014 if I break your model with action \u2014 then you probably ought to have a more open-ended view of the world, a different model! I look at it and I say, Everybody on Earth with money should buy this stuff and all 7.8 Billion people need it and it\u2019s only distributed to 0.1% of the market \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with this picture? At some point, someone is gonna decide to do the rational thing! Arguably they\u2019re doing it now! If price is going up 300% a year, that seems to me to be rational risk-takers acting about as fast as they can reasonably act! Without, you know, going through the sound barrier! Going through the sound barrier \u2014 there\u2019s a shock wave, and you rip the wings off the airplane! We\u2019re kind of pushing up against the sound barrier \u2014 the rate at which \u2014 what\u2019s the fastest an asset class can take on monetary energy without burning itself up! This might be close to the fastest! Because it\u2019s accelerating, isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t seen the numbers \u2014 someone should calculate the annualized yield, but I thought it was 230% RoR something, over the last 5\u201310 years."}

You know, Zimbabwe inflation rates are different than the US and the US is radically different than a year ago! So I think you gotta take into account monetary policy and I think you gotta take into account technology! Stock to flow doesn\u2019t take into account what happens if Tim Cook decides to build Bitcoin into the Apple Watch and into the Apple Phone? Those actions in technology, they have an impact, and doing it sooner rather than later will do it! And I know for a fact there are 10 people in the world \u2014 all they would have to do is put out a press release and they would move the price of Bitcoin!

And so you know, that\u2019s needed \u2014 people like you and MassMutual to show up and carry the banner after we\u2019ve done the light lifting \u2014 you guys do the heavy lifting taking us to $100k! And I think, yeah! 2025 is when you would expect people like Apple to be building their entire company around something like Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s a little maybe too early for them to start now but I think maybe by 2025 they\u2019ll be sold and they\u2019ll be convinced and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take us further! So the trend undeniably is Number Go Up! But what the model shows is that that number going up happens in spurts after the halving and then there\u2019s a bit of a come down and consolidation after it, that it follows this market pattern. So it seems to be holding up now, and that for me \u2014 and it\u2019s really sacrilegious as an Austrian economist to be saying this \u2014 but it suggests that maybe there is something about the way that the network works that is forcing this! And in fact, if you read Mises, what Mises says is, The reason you can\u2019t perform economic calculation and make scientific predictions in economics, is that economics does not have a constant. There is no constant in economics. In physics, in chemistry, in math, in all those things\u2014well not in math \u2014 you go back to a physical constant that is personally determined and easy to assert them and all of them go back to constants of nature, eventually. So based on that you\u2019re able to make scientific relationships and devise them. And it seems to me that \u2014 maybe\u2014the stock to flow model is showing us the ability to form calculations with human action for the first time with this kind of accuracy, maybe 21 Million is economics\u2019 first constant!"}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor: Well I think one effect is: the first 10 years, stock to flow and Bitcoin miners selling Bitcoin bootstrapped the network. I think we\u2019ll see an inversion, it\u2019s possible that all the Bitcoin miners become public and they stop selling any Bitcoin, and they become banks of their own, they start issuing equity and debt to finance the market, and you could actually see a reverse polarity there! As Bitcoin crashes into institutions that are publicly financeable, I think the dynamic changes quite a lot, because they have different options to access liquidity! So it\u2019s a different network when it\u2019s individuals that are unbanked that are in the cash business, than it is when it\u2019s institutions that are very very well-banked and well-financed! I think the network moving toward the point where it\u2019s just all transaction-based, and I think the transaction block size \u2014 those will get larger and transaction fees will go up and the network will settle into some equilibrium there as well."}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "text": "Michael Saylor [2:08:27]: I just take all the money in the world and I figure about half of it needs to be allocated to actual collectibles\u2014trophies! If you look at the typical person, everybody owns a set of things: their house, their car, their boat, their trophy assets that they\u2019re gonna keep, and those will have monetary value imbued in them. Those are the goods and products and whatever. And then there\u2019s another chunk which is just the treasury \u2014 everybody\u2019s got a natural treasury. And that\u2019s capital saved up for the future against uncertainty! I think it\u2019s natural that Bitcoin will just continually absorb that treasury energy from endowments, from corporations, from individuals, and my estimate is that it feels like it\u2019s about half! Half of everything should be treasury and the other half is tangible property! You can estimate it by counting the volume of gold and the total amount in sovereign debt: half of sovereign debt\u2014maybe you want to give a loan to your government because you love the government, but my experience is that 90% of the money invested in sovereign debt wasn\u2019t because we loved the government, it was just a store of value! And if you look at the S&P I think people invested in the S&P because they just didn\u2019t have confidence in their ability to pick stocks \u2014 they wanted a store of value! So I think if you added up all the store of value asset classes, you\u2019ll probably find yourself getting to a $200 Trillion number, plus or minus, against $400\u2013500 Trillion \u2014 it depends on how you calculate it! So you kind of conclude it\u2019s like 40\u201350%. And it\u2019s kind of common sense, right? Half of your money is, you want to save as fungible asset, and the other half you invest in things you love or things you believe in or you take risks on companies or the like. I think that was pretty obvious back in the day when savings accounts existed, it\u2019s just that savings accounts have been destroyed and so now people are saving in the stock market!"}

So long before I discovered Bitcoin I was a Paleo enthusiast and I think that a lot of stuff that comes out of thinking about how Paleolithic man lived for 3 Million years, I think is really useful health advice! What did your forebearers eat, and how did they live 100,000 years ago I think is helpful! It\u2019s helpful in your fitness routines and your eating routines. I think that 100,000\u2013200,000 years ago people ate lean proteins and they ate low-sugar content \u2014 maybe nuts. They didn\u2019t eat sugar-laden fruits and they probably didn\u2019t eat highly-engineered modern food, they certainly didn\u2019t eat any processed food. So my view is, I am pretty much carnivore! I eat a lot of steak, I eat a lot of chicken and fish, but I think that vegetables and nuts are okay! I think the keto diet is a pretty good diet. I understand the Salisbury Diet, I think that in the event that you have auto-immune diseases or inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s very effective, and so I can imagine living off of all meat, but I think it\u2019s equally reasonable \u2014 if you\u2019re coming up with a theory of health, I think if you start with the question: how did human beings live for 3 Million years before the modern agricultural age? And you model your lifestyle based upon that, I think that\u2019s consistent with the healthiest lifestyle, and your conclusions are: you\u2019re probably not gonna drink orange juice, you\u2019re not gonna drink cartons of vodka, you\u2019re not gonna consume processed foods, you\u2019re not gonna sit in a chair all day long, you\u2019re not gonna be afraid to be out in the sun all day long, you should probably do vigorous activity, and you should probably eat lean, healthy proteins!"}

Just getting rid of all plant matter and your body is made out of red meat and if you just eat red meat your digestive system will just have an enormously easy time with it! So I saw you drinking some cola there! I think if you ate a lot more beef, you would need fewer snacks and fewer pick-me-ups and fewer caffeine things!

Welcome back to Episode 3 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show here in the Saylor Series! So we\u2019ve covered with Michael Saylor so far the rise of Man through the Stone Ages through the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we saw how mankind can have a misstep that causes him to regress 1,000 years, and up into the Steel and Industrial Age. And today we\u2019re gonna go even further into the future, and the arc of all this is we\u2019re seeing how mankind does take these evolutionary steps forward in terms of both his morality and the tools that he conducts his life with. And we see, as Michael says, that natural selection through this process, helps mankind become smarter, faster, stronger. And we\u2019re coming to see that the defensive attributes of technology tend to be more important than offensive attributes over time. This is just leading us deeper into and closer to Bitcoin, which as we\u2019ll talk about later, is the ultimate monetary defensive technology! And in that sense, humans \u2014 the reason we\u2019re able to progress in this way and the reason we\u2019re different than any other animal \u2014 is because we are actually capable of harnessing and channeling energy across these field lines of our intellect. So we can form these abstract concepts and ideas and then actually energize them by harnessing energy in the natural world. And that\u2019s why in a geopolitical sense, naval power has been the force that governs the world. He who dominates the sea dominates the world! And in that context we\u2019re looking now as we progress into the digital age, as digital space being this new high seas, if you will. So in this episode we\u2019re gonna get into a lot of that and we\u2019re also gonna finish off by talking about an area that Mr. Saylor is an expert in, which is the history of scientific revolutions. And we\u2019re gonna talk about in particular the technology diffusion S-curve, which is when a new idea starts to permeate a society, it starts out relatively slowly, toward this inflection point and becomes rapidly adopted at an accelerating pace, before finally hitting a point of full market penetration, it starts to level out. And this will be important to comprehend in terms of not only all the innovations we\u2019ve seen recently \u2014 especially the Internet \u2014 but also the path that we\u2019d expect Bitcoin to continue to follow. Finally we\u2019ll touch on war. And how it is an accelerant to innovation. And how it can accelerate us down that path of technology S-curve and leaves us eventually with technologies that would be perceived as miracles to primitive man. As Michael will say later, Sufficiently advanced technologies are indistinguishable from magic! So I hope you\u2019re pumped! We\u2019re still building this big foundation getting into modernity, and this will be one of the final episodes that gets us there! So with that, let\u2019s get into it with Episode 3!"}

If you want a great vignette on why it\u2019s important to have capital that\u2019s mobile, study or just read any history of the Warburgs and what their family went through, and what all the Jewish families went through in the 30\u2019s in Germany. And what the bankers had to do to move capital out of the country, and you get a very poignant punctuated appreciation for the need of having secure capital that you control! So there\u2019s some, I think, general themes of technology throughout history, if you look across all of these. The general theme is: human beings marching toward being harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And everyone that\u2019s succeeded \u2014 every empire, individual, company \u2014 they all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger. George R.R. Martin, he wrote a bunch of books \u2014 he\u2019s known for Game of Thrones, but he also wrote a bunch of books on superheroes, or at least he called them wildcards. And it\u2019s about a bunch of superheroes or super-people that have genetic mutations, and they get it from some virus, and it\u2019s a universe full of normal people, and then jokers \u2014 people who have been hideously deformed by this virus, and then aces \u2014 people that have been given superpower. And he takes a very modern view of it, and he starts to analyze superpowers: a guy figures out he can shoot laser beams out of his hands, another woman can be invisible, or some dude can be a thin man! And he goes, There a lot of these superheroes, but after a while we quickly realized that the most powerful ones were the ones with defensive superpowers. Defensive attributes overcome all of the offensive attributes in a battle! So for example, the guy that\u2019s indestructible with no other superpower, can pick up a machine gun and kill everybody! And you can shoot him a million times, but he\u2019s indestructible! Whereas, the guy with the laser beams jumping out of his hands, he\u2019s just as mortal as you and me! And you hit him with one rock\u2014he goes down and he\u2019s dead! So it\u2019s the impossible-to-kill ones that end up winning all the battles between superheroes in the smackdown, and the ones with the sexy things, or sexy, really cool superpowers \u2014 they\u2019re useless! Because the guy that\u2019s got none of those \u2014 he just gets a bazooka and he just fires! Or he\u2019s like, I\u2019m indestructible so I\u2019m gonna set off an atomic bomb in the city and kill everybody but myself because I\u2019m indestructible! It\u2019s pretty easy to win the war if you\u2019re indestructible. And it causes you to come to a conclusion about history and who wins in history: unbreakable is better, antifragile is best! So the superhero that\u2019s good is the one that you hit him and you can\u2019t hurt him! But the superheroes that are most frightening are the ones where you shoot him with a laser beam and now they can shoot your laser beams back at you! And you mind-read them and they absorb your mind-reading and they can mind-read you! And you fly at the speed at the sound and now they can fly at the speed of sound! [11:05] Like that character, what is it \u2014"}

Maybe Rogue! It\u2019s the one that absorbs your power and plays it back at you! You know, pretty soon it\u2019s like, I am indestructible and I have every other power and you just better get out of the way! And that\u2019s antifragile, right? I\u2019m looking for the fight! I\u2019m looking for people because I\u2019m just gonna absorb their thing! So you see that theme through history: the really successful governments, empires, organizations, they\u2019re continually fighting, they\u2019re continually absorbing \u2014 the Romans absorbed the Carthaginian\u2019s navy in 90 days! It\u2019s easier said than done! It wasn\u2019t like some Roman politician said, These are Carthaginian ships \u2014 they\u2019re inferior to us. We will invent our own ships! It\u2019s like, Not too proud to copy, not too proud to absorb it! This kind of principle can explain the success the United States in the wars of the last century or more. Why did we win World War I, World War II? Why is America America? Well there\u2019s two narratives. Millionaires. One is: because we\u2019re more patriotic and we\u2019re righteous and we\u2019re better! The other one is: the Europeans were fighting in Europe and we were fighting in Europe! So we were fighting, they were soft! When you\u2019re dropping bombs in the middle of suburban Germany, you\u2019re attacking the soft underbelly of the citizens in Germany, or the soft underbelly of the citizens in France, or the Battle of Britain. This is the citizen population being ravaged by a war. And that destroyed their economies, right? Destroyed their culture! Same happened in Russia, Italy. It\u2019s happened in China, and the Chinese fought a war in China\u2019s soil. The Japanese fought sort of a portion of a war on their own soil with the atomic warheads. On the other and, the US hadn\u2019t fought a war on US soil since 1865. Okay? So who\u2019s hard? Back to this missile idea, right? If you can throw a missile 3,000 miles and your enemy can throw a missile back 300 miles back at you \u2014 it\u2019s pretty simple: I have a rifle, you have a pistol! I stand back 1,000 feet \u2014 your pistol\u2019s good for 200 feet! I take 100 shots, eventually 1 hits \u2014 you\u2019re a perfect shot, it doesn\u2019t matter! Longer arms! So this idea: art you unbreakable? Or back to terrain: what is the terrain? The geography determines a lot of things! If you take a modern ship: take a modern yacht built in the year 2020, with every piece of modern equipment on it. Now try to sail it to Afghanistan! You probably won\u2019t get there! Something will probably break! Try to sail it to Rome without stopping in a port along the way. You probably won\u2019t make it! Robert, nobody does! They all stop and hide somewhere! It\u2019s really hard to move stuff over the ocean thousands of miles! It\u2019s really hard! Now, why don\u2019t you try to sail an armada of 1,000 ships 3,000 miles in order to invade America? Germans couldn\u2019t sail 13 miles across the Straits of Dover! The Japanese couldn\u2019t cross from Japan to China during the kamikaze, and that\u2019s not very far! It\u2019s really hard! There\u2019s only one guy that ever pulled it off\u2014William the Conqueror in 1066! Nobody else managed to cross 13 miles. That\u2019s your hydraulic moat! It\u2019s really hard! It explains the culture of the U.K. It explains the culture of the United States. It explains a lot of other culture. It explains the balance of power, I think! If you just say, Here\u2019s someone that you couldn\u2019t kill who could kill you! I had the option to fight on your turf, but you would never have the option to fight on my turf. Now, that in and of its way is the reason that security is so incredibly important to the Bitcoin network! What is important is that it not break! If I\u2019m indestructible, I don\u2019t have to be the fastest, the shiniest, the whatever anything! I just have to be indestructible! If I\u2019m indestructible \u2014 the indestructible man goes and buys a machine gun and he\u2019s the most powerful superhero in the room, right? The indestructible blockchain goes and buys a digital app, or another crypto network, an off-chain app, or a Lightning, or a Binance, or a Coinbase, or a Square Cash or whatever, and it\u2019s just fine! It\u2019s the most powerful network in the room! [17:29] Because the thing that made it the winner was its indestructibility, its immortality! Not the fact that it could shoot laser beams from its fingers, or it was beautiful, or it could fly with its pretty wings, or it was invisible. All of these other things? Privacy, transactions \u2014 all these other things, they\u2019re interesting, but they pale compared to the characteristic of immortality! Being indestructible in the here and now \u2014 pretty useful superhero power! Being indestructible and never aging \u2014 double useful superpower! And as for the rest, if you\u2019re an open software protocol, someone\u2019s gonna code an extension to your protocol to give you every other cool power that anybody wants! I can find a way to construct every other superpower by hook or crook, and that makes me antifragile and now I\u2019m like the frightening impossible-to-stop superhero!"}

The mining rate, it\u2019s like a secondary particular effect that happens in the first few years of its evolution, but exponentially it becomes irrelevant. It\u2019s a second order driver. The first order driver is, [Is] the hardness infinitely hard? And then adoption and utility and inflation in the fiat reference frame that it\u2019s operating in. A couple more points that are worth making on technology and human history. Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. All of these things come down to: how did I channel energy? So, navy power. The British Navy ruled the sea, the Phoenicians, the Venetians, the Greeks, the Romans. The Americans today control the seas via their aircraft carriers and via naval power. And naval power is just bringing overwhelming stronger force to bear that\u2019s faster, that\u2019s harder, than any other force anywhere on Earth. I park an aircraft carrier somewhere and death rains from above! So we\u2019ve seen all empires are driven by a naval power. In time, we invented airplanes. And then air power became the thing! And air power is again all about death from above: the most powerful navy idea is airplanes flying off an aircraft carrier! First it was the battleship by: show up in your harbor \u2014 I blast everything. Then it became air power. And if I could get above you \u2014 and we saw this in [inaudible 21:56] \u2014 it is impossible for a modern nation state to function if it does not control its own air space. You saw that in the First Gulf War, the Second Gulf War. The United States, especially the United States air force, could pretty much bomb any country back to the Stone Age in a matter of a week, once you lose your air supremacy, once you lose control of your air space. There\u2019s no hope for you! You can take out every port, every power reactor, every generator, every serious building, they\u2019re all gone. Death from above! There\u2019s nothing you can do! You\u2019re at the bottom of the gravity well. And with technology today, someone can sit out 6 miles up \u2014 you can\u2019t shoot down a plane moving at high speeds 6 miles up! You have to fight the gravity well to get there! They\u2019re just working opposite: it\u2019s an energy thing, right? So I\u2019m moving from a lower energy state\u2014I\u2019m on the ground moving enemies around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I have a boat, I\u2019m moving heavy masses around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I\u2019m above you dropping munitions on you. Then after that, it became nuclear power! You harness nuclear power and that ended World War II pretty definitively in a hurry. Then we go to space satellite power! And then you go up the gravity well some more, and that manifests itself primarily with GPS. If you look at the impact of having a Global Positioning Satellite, that\u2019s what allows me to drop a laser-guided bomb or a drone anywhere on Earth and guide it day or night to anything! And that\u2019s a massive source of American supremacy \u2014 controlling those GPS satellites! And you lose them \u2014 big problem, too! [23:53] One of my favorite books, and I note it, is The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. And in it, Robert Heinlein, he writes about a bunch of Loonies\u2014basically Libertarians that live on the moon that believe in making their own way, and their motto is, There ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch! Abbreviated to TANSTAAFL, and he introduced that idea, and he introduced that idea. And they take it to the extreme, which is like, You\u2019re air\u2019s not even free on the moon\u2014you pay for everything! You pay for water, you pay for food, you pay for air. Everybody pulls their own weight. No one waits for a bail-out. There\u2019s no bail-out coming from anybody. And they\u2019re not big fans of authority. They don\u2019t like being told what to do! And the plot of the book winds on that they\u2019re being oppressed by Earthlings who are making them work as slaves and they\u2019re taking 90% of their economic productivity and shipping back basically their future to Earth and they\u2019re gradually suffocating and starving them to death. It\u2019s just onerous. Taxation without representation! But onerous. So the Loonies decide to fight back with the help of an A.I. computer. The first A.I. computer I can remember! The name of the computer is Mike, by the way! And their technique is they realize that they\u2019ve gotta catapult, and they start tossing rocks down the gravity well, and they just take a big rock, put it in their catapult, and it doesn\u2019t take that much force to toss it off the moon because they\u2019re low-G, they\u2019re tossing the rock out of a 1/8th G or whatever, and it hits the Earth, goes into a trajectory, and of course this starts picking up speed! And by the time it lands, it\u2019s like an atomic warhead. They just start tossing \u2019em at random places until the Federation Empire that\u2019s oppressing them decides that maybe it\u2019s had enough! And of course the lesson is: it\u2019s humans channeling energy, but they\u2019re channeling gravitational energy \u2014 and a lot of it! And there\u2019s a lot more energy than the stuff that we have! All through human history \u2014 since a million years ago to today \u2014 it\u2019s really the story of intelligent people looking around for, Where is the energy coming from? And how do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?"}

They predicted the rise of what they called narrowcasting, as opposed to broadcasting, which we would call social media today. They predicted the rise of anonymous digital cash which would be disruptive to the nation state, which we would think Bitcoin is. And it also predicted the digitization of securities, so other property rights going away from a government function to be provided via software. And one of the things that was interesting there is that they compared digital space to the high seas. Basically saying, The reason why whoever controls the high seas controls the world is because that\u2019s the most frictionless environment! You can move things with the least energy on the seas, once you can conquer them. So whoever controls that domain sort of controls the world. But also \u2014 because it\u2019s frictionless \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to project dominion over the high seas. So we don\u2019t have law, really \u2014 we have international waters everywhere in the world! And they compare that and analogize it to digital space, where it\u2019s a frictionless space that whoever is dominant there will be dominant in the 21st century, but it will also be very difficult to project dominion. So it will be unregulated, largely! So they\u2019re using that to kind of make the case for digital cash, and the fact that people would be able to escape oppressive regimes. Once you get your capital in the digital space, you\u2019re no longer under the thumb of the government of the local oppressive monopoly. So I just think it\u2019s interesting how it just always comes down to the terrain, right?"}

It seems like it gets harder for any one government to assert control over the things that take place virtually. So there\u2019s a lot of virtual empowerment going on, but there\u2019s a lot of other things going on too! I guess I would end this section with just a couple of dynamics that I think I\u2019ve seen over and over again with technology. When I was at MIT I studied the history of science and I read about the structure of scientific revolutions and I studied all different types of technology diffusions. And there\u2019s certain things that pop out. A lot of times you\u2019ll see an S-curve where it\u2019ll start slow and it\u2019ll accelerate until it reaches diminishing returns, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not an interesting technology anymore! You see that a lot! But, one of the lessons of history is: it\u2019s very difficult to figure out when the curve starts, and it\u2019s hard to stop it once it starts, but it\u2019s a lot easier to invest in it and to forecast it once it starts. But before it starts, people will say, Well next year this will commercialize\u2014or in 2, 5, 10 years. You could be off by 2 years, you could be off by 100 years! You remember Google Glass? How big that was gonna be? And how that was a lead balloon, and how many years is it after Google Glass and it\u2019s still not gonna happen next year either! Technology fails until it succeeds \u2014 that\u2019s another trend and another theme. So you see over and over again people pick at technologists and they\u2019ll say, Oh it\u2019ll never work! It\u2019ll never work! It\u2019ll never work! In the year 1902, before the Wright brothers flew that next year, if you\u2019d asked the most learned people on Earth, they would\u2019ve given you 100 reasons why airplanes will fly, and they would give you 100 examples of how they didn\u2019t fly, and they would talk you to death. And the thing about these paradigm shifts is, oftentimes it\u2019s not the learned individuals that make the breakthrough! Aircraft weren\u2019t designed by professors of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering and fluid dynamics and mathematicians \u2014 they all failed miserably! The Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics! They had a bicycle shop \u2014 tinkerers! They\u2019re the ones that ushered in the age! And they did it against all conventional wisdom! And on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci tried to develop his own flying contraption! Every brilliant person for hundreds of years tried it \u2014 failed! All failed! And then some dudes in Dayton, Ohio that have a bicycle shop succeed. It happens like that! The story of John Harrison inventing, discovering a method to determine longitude on the ocean \u2014 it\u2019s articulated in the book, Longitude, it\u2019s an amazing story! Everybody knew how to find lattitude, it was easy, it was just like, against the North Star. But longitude\u2019s very hard because the Earth\u2019s spinning all the time and it required massively complicated calculations! They gave it to Newtonian professors at Cambridge and Oxford \u2014 the smartest mathematicians and astronomers in the world \u2014 no one could figure it out! Finally they posted a \u00a310,000 prize and John Harrison\u2014who was not a mathematician, he\u2019s a clockmaker \u2014figured it out! And the way he figured it out is he made a clock that was accurate, and they put one clock on the ship, and they set it to the Greenwich Observatory, the royal observatory, which is in Greenwich, England. Hence the term, Greenwich Mean Time. Greenwich Mean Time comes because you sail down the Thames past the royal observatory in Greenwich, you set your clock on that, and then you have another clock, and then every day at noon \u2014 if you\u2019re in the Caribbean you look up and then you set that clock \u2014 and then you just subtract the time on the one from the time from the other, multiply it by 15 degrees and you\u2019ve got your longitude! It was a tinkerer\u2019s solution to a problem everybody else wanted to solve with star charts and tables and complex math! But of course, ships\u2019 captains in the middle of the Caribbean or in a storm, they can\u2019t do complex math! They just wanna stay alive! So you see lots of examples in history where people try to do something and they either accidentally discover it like Penicillin, or a tinkerer discovers it, and not the educated \u2014 and then all the professors crap all over it, and they all swear it\u2019ll never work! And the tendency is either to reject it \u2014 people don\u2019t like change \u2014 or it doesn\u2019t get embraced until everybody dies, or until there\u2019s a war! And war has a way of opening your mind because when someone drops a bomb on your head and you\u2019re burning or screaming, then the pain causes you to take a more open-minded attitude! So a lot of stuff happened after World War II and happens in various wars, and you can trace it through human history! That drives innovation faster! Generational change will drive it faster. People keep trying it, and then just because it\u2019s failed 1,000 times doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t succeed, but when it does succeed, then it\u2019s probably unstoppable for a while! And hence, yeah you just get to this phrase, which is kind of punctuation for modern technology: Arthur C. Clark writes, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And it was a great quote, it\u2019s a quote that I put on the back of my prospectus when my company became public in \u201998. I believed it then \u2014 we have thousands and thousands of examples of magic things in our lives today! Literally magic things, that are just technical things! It\u2019s always been that way, and to a primitive man, a rifle looks magical! Or an airplane! And now, we\u2019re starting to deal with some software technologies and digital technologies that don\u2019t just look magical to a primitive man, they\u2019re gonna look magical to a modern man! Because they just really are getting pretty magical!"}

So that was Episode 3 of the Saylor Series. I hope you enjoyed that! We continue our progress towards modernity, and laying this really solid intellectual foundation through the lens of technology, anthropology, civilizational development, military \u2014 all of these aspects that lead us to the importance of Bitcoin as money! And as I said in the intro, I like to think of this whole arc as an evolutionary process. I actually consider that evolution is the inorganic form of innovation, or you could say that innovation is the organic form of evolution. So they\u2019re both about colliding ideas together and with reality, to test which ideas, strategies, and approaches work best. Which offer the highest utility to the organism or human being that\u2019s set an intention and an aim. It\u2019s through this iterative process\u2014as Saylor says it makes us harder, faster, and stronger. And I think what\u2019s starting to shape up here as I think you\u2019ll see is that the defensive attributes tend to be even more important than offensive attributes. So if you have an ability to defend yourself say behind a wall of water \u2014 you\u2019re in the United States, we\u2019re defended on both sides by large walls of water in the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, we have this natural defensive advantage! So it\u2019s really difficult to invade us without having long-ranging weapons when we dominate the naval territory already. We are the dominant naval force because of our access to the oceans and our protection from hostile powers. And I liked the analogy that Saylor gave when he talked about the George R.R. Martin superheroes \u2014 I think they were called the Aces. It wasn\u2019t the superhero with the best offensive capability \u2014 the laser beams out of the eyes or whatever \u2014 that became dominant, it was actually the one that was indestructible! Because he could essentially subject himself to any situation and survive! Which reminded me of that saying which I think is from Sun Tzu \u2014 it might be from Lao Tzu \u2014 If you wait long enough by the river, you live to see the bodies of your enemies float by. So it\u2019s this point that, if you are optimized for survivability, that tends to make you dominant competitor over time, right? Time is on your side! Whereas time would be a raid against all of your competitors. And as time being the ultimate judge of all things, it\u2019s probably the defining competitive competency you could have, is just really high resiliency or robustness, or ideally even, antifragility, where you\u2019re actually improving from the hostility you face in the world! And advancing through adversity! So I thought that was interesting and clearly plays really well into the Bitcoin narrative. We were looking at how the terrain had shaped battles throughout history and why America fighting in Europe in say World War II was much different than war taking place on American soil. We were fighting and attacking the soft underbelly as Saylor called it, but we weren\u2019t exposed to that same level attack ourselves! Well with the small exception of Pearl Harbor. And that\u2019s why the nation that controls the sea controls the world, because that is the terrain that it\u2019s the hardest to project power and dominion across, so whoever is dominant there just runs things! You can move energy around the world much more quickly and bring to force to bear much more quickly anywhere in the world. And so when you look at Bitcoin through that lens, it\u2019s like it\u2019s already the longest and most rigid chain, so it has already become dominant! If you look at digital space and compare it to the ocean, Bitcoin has dominated digital space for monetary networks! It\u2019s impossible to compete with it as money, because it\u2019s already perfected all the properties that make money money, and it\u2019s done so in this digital terrain that all other competitors would be competing for! Which is: it\u2019s a very low friction domain, so you can move things at the speed of light in the digital space. And you can defend things with cryptography at very low cost! You can basically erect these impenetrable walls of encrypted energy at relatively low cost. So Bitcoin has just optimized for that! It gives us a way to store the vital life energy that is money behind a wall that basically cannot be breached! I like that military analogy pointing to it as a very fundamental breakthrough. And the other thing there \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk about this in this episode \u2014 that I think about, is: it sort of balances this antifragility or robustness with also a degree of adaptivity. So even though Bitcoin is the longest chain and the most rigid, it has these unbendable rules that favors its holders, it also still maintains this ability to adopt new features that are beneficial to it! And one of my favorite authors and good friend, Brandon Quittem, he\u2019s written about this! In Mycelial space this is called Horizontal gene transfer. So when a Mycelium \u2014 which is the underground informational network of a fungus, like a mushroom \u2014 when it encounters a threat in the environment, it can actually code new enzymes and proteins and defense mechanisms against that threat at one particular spot. These Mycelial mats can be tens of, hundreds of square miles in size! But if it encounters a threat, it creates a formula to neutralize it, and even any one spot of that Mycelial mat, it can incorporate those lessons into the entire organism! So it\u2019s actually learning from interaction with its competitors at the edges, but then incorporating all of its lessons into the entire organism! Which is something that Bitcoin is capable of doing! So it\u2019s kind of a tangent but pretty interesting stuff in regards to Bitcoin! And then, as we said earlier, what distinguishes us as human is that we have this unique ability \u2014 I think Saylor described it earlier \u2014 we\u2019re the only animal that plays with fire. So we have this special ability to mold our behavior in a way that allows us to harness energy and then we can channel it. We can create these abstractions of thought and speech in the ideological space, and then we can use that energy to energize these formulas that we\u2019ve created. And that\u2019s what makes us human! That\u2019s what we do! When you look at anything \u2014 you look at a table or a house or a computer, all of these things began as ideas that we then funneled energy into. We harnessed energy in the natural world whether its hydrocarbons or fire \u2014 which was kind of the Stone Age energy network \u2014 solar radiation, whatever it may be! And we channel that energy into the manifestation of these ideas. And that\u2019s what helps us become more productive and enjoy a higher quality of life over time. It\u2019s such a radical new way to look at humanity, it really makes you appreciate being human! I think too, we were talking about the naval power and how that\u2019s shaped us throughout history. Naval power was the predominant aspect of what determined which nation is in geopolitical control, but what I think \u2014 and I got this from I book I read called The Next 100 Years \u2014 that predicted that in the 21st century it would actually no longer be control of the seas that mattered so much, but it would come to be control of space. And you see that somewhat in US military dominance today in that we control the seas actually with our aircraft carriers, which essentially means we can control the air space of nations. Again back to fighting the battle on the terrain that favors you most: by going into the sky\u2014again this very frictionless space of air \u2014 we\u2019re also able to take advantage of the gravity well that is the planet. So we can drop bombs at a very low cost. For a plane to release a bomb is essentially no cost once it\u2019s up there, but it brings us gigantic force to bear on its terrestrial targets! And that\u2019s why it\u2019s in that sense we can consider today being this extension of naval power. It has the highest optionality. It has the greatest, most degrees of freedom both offensively and defensively. It\u2019s really hard to shoot down one of these aircrafts moving at supersonic speed, which gives it a lot of defensive capability, but it also can bring a lot of force to bear really quickly by dropping bombs or shooting missiles. And all of this is facilitated by control of that frictionless space in the sea, which is the aircraft carrier, which itself is very hard to attack because it\u2019s thousands of miles out to sea, it\u2019s just flying these planes in! So that\u2019s why the aircraft carrier today is the dominant military technology. But I think as we get further into the 21st century, if you go even another layer higher say into low-Earth orbit, you can get into a territory that has even more offensive and defensive optionality, and it\u2019s just way harder to attack! It\u2019s literally in orbit! And in the book I referred to, The Next 100 Years, I think they were called ion cannons. So the thought was, whichever country came to get these ion cannons into orbit first would have a power that\u2019s even superordinate to what we consider aircraft carriers to be today. So the space \u2014 if you want to call it space, it\u2019s kind of just Earth orbit \u2014 is the next frontier for military dominance. I think that will be really interesting to see shake out as we look at the development of history through this lens going forward. And Saylor brought up that book The Moon is a Harsh Mistress that really brought this point home to me, because there were these rebels on the Moon, and they were tired of being tyrannized by Earthlings, so they basically took advantage of their ultimate high ground and just started throwing rocks at Earth! And because it was at the bottom of that gravity well, the Earthlings were forced to capitulate eventually and give into their demands! So it just keeps going back to this principle of holding high ground, holding the best terrain in any confrontation. [51:35] Like the moon, digital space, it is the ultimate high ground! It enables us, even as an individual today with Bitcoin, you can safeguard Billions of dollars of capital, which is life force, by memorizing a 12-word seed phrase. You can move it around the world at the speed of light permissionlessly at virtually zero cost! If you\u2019re talking about moving $1 Billion worth of Bitcoin you can probably move it for from $5-$20. You try to move that same $1 Billion across space in a fiat currency system, you\u2019re gonna spend a lot of time navigating regulations of both the regime you\u2019re sending from and the regime you\u2019re sending to, you\u2019re gonna pay a lot of bank fees, you\u2019re gonna be answering a lot of questions, you\u2019re gonna be probably paying a lot of taxes as well. The number one export of empires is being security! They gatecheck all these movements of value across their domain. And so these rights and abilities that were reserved for the nation states in eras past \u2014 where they could move goods and capital \u2014 if they\u2019re dominant militarily they could do so pretty much without permission, they could do whatever they want! That same capability is now being delivered to the individual via software! So it\u2019s this radical new worldview that\u2019s shaking out where, because we don\u2019t need an empire to honor \u2014 at least the property rights of money with Bitcoin \u2014 as far as we can see today, maybe other property rights will follow as well in time. But that is a big slice out of a pie! We also don\u2019t need the nation states to honor the property rights of money, that entire function of trust and security has fallen to distributed software! And it\u2019s hard to even fathom how big of a game changer that really is! And when I think about that a little more, it\u2019s just that these digital high seas, they\u2019re weakening the geographic constraints to being. All of a sudden, you\u2019re not as beholden to the local monopolies and systems, because you can now participate in this global network that has many more degrees of freedom and a much lower need for permissions. You don\u2019t need to check as many boxes and satisfy as many bureaucrats interacting with the digital domain. It really is this much more of a pure free market environment, where the best ideas win if you\u2019re able to serve your customer! By whatever means necessary you can earn a living! My mind goes back to a story of girls in the Middle East that are actually prohibited from holding bank accounts! It\u2019s illegal for women to hold bank accounts in certain countries, so this contributes to their disenfranchisement, because they can\u2019t even earn a living in the home. So women not only are perceived as second-class citizens but in many ways are second-class citizens because they can\u2019t hold a bank account, they can\u2019t contribute to the livelihood of their home, so they\u2019re just forced to stay home and work and do as their told, while the men go out and make a living! But with Bitcoin, some of the women at least were able to find jobs online! Whether it\u2019s copy-editing or anything you could do that was informational. Any job that you could conduct online, which is more and more jobs as we become more advanced. And they were able to be paid and remunerated in Bitcoin! So all of a sudden they just leapfrogged this entire restrictive system that would really prevent them from even increasing their own condition in life. They cannot improve their own conditions because they\u2019re trapped in this cage, but all of a sudden Bitcoin gave them this exit option to just go out into the world and earn a living based on their own skills! So that\u2019s just one example of how the geographic constraints are weakened. And I think we\u2019ll see many more of those coming out. Another thing that comes to mind here is: I\u2019ve analogized Amazon in the past. Amazon came to be a dominant monopoly in the world because they essentially out-competed four digital distribution networks, which are a naturally scarce service for the world. You only need \u2014 it has a huge network effect, so there\u2019s big economies of scale and a big advantage to being bigger in that space. And Amazon was able to bootstrap itself in a way by leveraging two things, two benefits of being digital and not being a brick and mortar. Firstly, they were able to offer low prices to their customer because they had lower costs of fulfillment. They didn\u2019t have brick and mortar stores. For a while they were skirting sales tax, so they would distribute from a state that had low to no sales tax, and they were selling it to other states without being deemed for sales tax. So they\u2019re taking advantage of this digital space. And then Two, because in a bookstore you can only fit so many titles. Maybe you can fit only a quarter million books in a store, but the advantage to being online in an online store is that you have literally limitless selection! Anything that is available on Earth, you can sell in your store! So I think that\u2019s one of the reasons Bezos zeroed in on books \u2014 Amazon started out as an online book store \u2014 is because that is a product where that advantage is super favorable! There are millions of books written, the selection is just endless! They\u2019re a totally non-fungible thing. Every book is different. And I think Bezos started there and used that as his pressure point, because he could leverage not only the sales tax and lack of brick and mortar as we mentioned earlier, but he could also leverage the limitless selection capability of an Internet-based bookstore to really just dethrone a lot of competition. So he could offer it at lower prices and he could offer it at wider selection! So super interesting there! And he was smart enough to leverage the advantages of the digital business model in a really pressure-point focused way! And when I look at tech and Bitcoin through that lens, I see \u2014 and Saylor alluded to this as well \u2014 the overall trend is that distributed software and encryption is very empowering to the individual! So these things that we used to need large entities to satisfy, because there are a lot of fixed costs that you had to incur to deliver these functions, whether it was a bookstore or whether it was a bank custodying your gold \u2014 all of a sudden we could do these things via software at very low fixed cost! It can be replicated at near zero variable cost! So once it\u2019s up and running you can basically do it anywhere net of the actual physical distribution fees! Assuming there are some, right? If it\u2019s software there\u2019s basically no distribution fee either. That\u2019s what the Apple App Store is. And so, it\u2019s interesting to see how that \u2014 I\u2019m thinking about this a lot. It\u2019s like, Okay, we needed empires and large entities in the past to provide security, to create this intersubjective fabric of trust in the world so that we could interoperate, but now a lot of these human-based politicized or politicizable institutions are now going into trust-minimized software! Where it\u2019s like, Here are the rules, you can\u2019t bend them or break them! And Bitcoin is just the greatest expression of that! Amazon and stuff like that they still have a political dimension because they\u2019re traditional organizations. They\u2019re essentially under control. But something like Bitcoin is just a pure instance of that: it\u2019s just pure unbendable, unbreakable rules that help you channel energy across time and space, and satisfy wants more efficiently! I think too \u2014 and this gets a bit into the Sovereign Individual thesis \u2014 we didn\u2019t get into this a lot in the interview but, as people wake up to this truth that we have this ultimate savings technology in cyberspace or this non-state central bank, whatever we want to call it, it\u2019s a medium for permissionlessly storing your wealth in a way to no one can compromise! And you don\u2019t need any government to then acknowledge or honor the property rights you have in Bitcoin. You\u2019ve converted property rights to information! Owning is now knowing! With the increasing incentives to exit inflationary currency \u2014 again the book The Sovereign Individual goes really deep into this, but \u2014 the numbers are roughly: for every $10,000 you can reduce your tax liability, assuming you can compound that capital at an average return rate of 10%, you\u2019re talking about tens of millions of dollars over the average earner\u2019s lifetime. It becomes at least a multi-million dollar and in many cases tens of millions of dollars decision of holding your money in an inflationary fiat versus holding your money in non-inflationary Bitcoin. So I think as the market wakes up to this and starts to do the calculus, I think you\u2019re just gonna see this overwhelming demand for security from distributed tech \u2014 with such secure money as in Bitcoin \u2014 and it\u2019s just gonna pull demand out of these anachronistic security models like the nation state and banks and all these other politicized institutions! And you know \u2014 wow! It\u2019s just a lot to even think about! It\u2019s hard to even fathom where that goes! The Sovereign Individual predicted social media, they predicted Bitcoin. Another thing they predicted was the actual digitization of security \u2014 so other property rights getting eaten by software. And my general thought there is that the government\u2019s not gonna let go of any of this willingly. It\u2019s not like the government ever acknowledged and accepted Bitcoin! Bitcoin just grew up in the wild somewhat flying under the radar long enough to establish itself as something that\u2019s really difficult to take down now. Today I think we\u2019re at $350 Billion market cap of Bitcoin, so it\u2019s a really entrenched monetary network at this point, and it\u2019s exhibited a lot of antifragility! I think as \u2014 my theory would be \u2014 as Bitcoin continues to ascend and demonetize inflationary government business models, that some of these functions that governments have bureaucratized will just start to fall to free market competitors. There\u2019s just gonna come a point where governments no longer solve enough to keep \u2014 one example I like that I heard from Saifedean is \u2014 there\u2019s a national train agency in Lebanon, and he made the point that there hasn\u2019t been a track of railroad in Lebanon for 50 years. It\u2019s that old saying that, There\u2019s nothing more permanent than a temporary government solution! So we have all these layers of unnecessary bureaucratic buildup across the world in all the countries! Because they\u2019re not accountable to their PnL! There\u2019s no free market competition keeping them honest! So they get away with these asinine models where they have a train committee but no trains! So I think as those useless or worthless or unaccountable institutions start to shrivel up and die because there\u2019s no funding for them, that you\u2019ll see whatever functions that they provided or were intended to provide start to fall into the free market \u2014 I think software is just eating that up! So that is a lot to think about, and it\u2019s something to keep your eye on! I also liked how Saylor dove into this diffusion of technology which is really just another way of saying the diffusion of ideas. And it follows the S-curve. This is\u2014I think it\u2019s The History of Scientific Revolutions \u2014 and it talks about this S-curve where there\u2019s a beginning or there\u2019s innovators that adopt it first, and then it hits an inflection point say around 13.5% market penetration, and the innovation starts becoming adopted at a super accelerated rate! So the curve just goes vertical for a while until it\u2019s suffused and saturated the market sufficiently where it starts to level off and you have the laggards sort of adopting it late. And when we look at Bitcoin through that lens, we\u2019re very early in the flat part of the curve. We\u2019re far below 13.5% total adoption! We\u2019re probably more in the range of 1\u20133% as we sit here in late 2020. And Saylor just makes this great point that those curves are impossible to predict! You never know when it\u2019s going to work! The idea can exist for hundreds of years before it ever gets commercialized! You think back to the Native Americans that had the pottery wheel, but never figured out to turn it on its side and use it as a wagon wheel! The idea was there but no one had harnessed it or commercialized it! But his point is that once it does become commercialized it hits a certain critical mass that it\u2019s very clear to see that you can invest in it now \u2014 like we\u2019re almost right before it hits that vertical point and reaches just huge gains as the rest of the world wakes up to the importance and utility of the innovation! And I thought that was great. The other thing \u2014 in his book The Virtual Wave, which I read preparing for this \u2014 he laid out in 2010 saying Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google \u2014 buy these, hold \u2014 they\u2019re gonna eat everything! Don\u2019t diversify! Here\u2019s why \u2014 going into the network effects and all of this history of scientific revolutions and paradigm shifts. He saw that! And he\u2019s now proclaiming Bitcoin to be a similar pattern of proliferation! It has reached this critical mass! We\u2019re north of $100 Billion market cap! The race has been won, almost, for digital money, and now it\u2019s just a question of how big does digital money become relative to everything else, relative to analog money? If you\u2019re keen to believe the advantages that digital tech has over analog tech, I mean clearly I\u2019m a Bitcoin bull, I would say it eats all of \u2018em! It offers so much more utility to the users, and it\u2019s so much more energy efficient! It\u2019s as if: you don\u2019t adopt it \u2014 you just get left behind! So there\u2019s this Darwinian propulsion to adopt the hardest money and we can\u2019t get any harder than Bitcoin! It\u2019s 21 Million fixed and forever! And then he brought up too that these things seem crazy at first, like when the Wright brothers finally flew, had their first maiden voyage and figured out how to fly, he made the point that anyone you interviewed up until that time \u2014 you could have interviewed the smartest people in the world, they would tell you flat out it\u2019s not possible, mankind will never fly, it just can\u2019t be done! Until it\u2019s done, right? Until a tinkerer figures it out in their garage! Which points to \u2014 it\u2019s the tinkerers and not the theoreticians that bring about breakthrough! I feel like some people think that there are geniuses sitting inside of Harvard writing out a bunch of complex formulas that figure out this practical mechanical innovation in the world, and that\u2019s just largely not the case! It\u2019s entrepreneurs putting their skin in the game, failing, failing forward, learning from their mistakes, facing the unknown, adapting to the unknown, trying new things, and then all of a sudden there\u2019s a breakthrough! All of a sudden, the plane flies, the Wright brothers are sky-bound! So that\u2019s what drives humanity forward! It\u2019s this relentless impulse to tinker and play with things, not the intellectuals sitting in their ivory towers theorizing. And he brought up too that John Harrison \u2014 no one could figure out longitude! It was easy to figure out lattitude, but no one could figure out longitude. And how did they solve it? They put a reward in the paper! It was a \u00a310,000 reward: anyone that could solve this, how to calculate longitude, we\u2019ll give you a financial reward! So what did they do? They went to the free market! They incentivized the collective intelligence of humanity\u2014as best they could \u2014 through the newspaper at the time, and this guy John Harrison the clock maker comes out of the woodwork and figures out, Hey! I can solve this spatial problem which is the calculation of longitude at sea, with a temporal answer! He\u2019s a clock maker, right? So he makes this super-precise clock, which is just kind of out of the blue! Like, had he been a theoretician, he would\u2019ve just sat there and tried to figure out how to calculate space and observational things, but this guy took a 180 and he solved a spatial problem with a temporal solution. And that\u2019s the kind of problem-solving you get out of the free market that you just won\u2019t get out of legislated innovation or think tanks or things like this! So the point there I think is: you can\u2019t push water! Innovation is something that emerges naturally through us \u2014 our creative impulse! You can\u2019t force it! You can\u2019t yell at your garden to grow faster, right? It needs to go through its own natural process of discovery to get the best ideas to the surface! And the only thing we can hope to do in our socioeconomic systems is to incentivize that, right? They gave, they put a reward in the paper for this! That\u2019s what the free market is! Just go into the world: you have the liberty to do pretty much anything you want as long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone, kill anyone, or steal from anyone \u2014 these are the actual pillars of free market capitalism! And make bets! Invest your time, energy, and capital onto things you think \u2014 onto solving problems you think the market wants solved! And you think you have a unique way to do it! And by betting against one another, we develop better, faster, and cheaper ways of doing things! We incentivize this ideation process that rewards humanity forever in the form of innovation! And I like to say there that it\u2019s the tinkering entrepreneurs \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more problematic to problems than tinkering entrepreneurs! If we want to solve problems, we need to harness our collective ingenuity, and we do that through free market capitalism and tinkering, not through legislation! Finally, we got into war. We talked about it as an accelerant to innovation. My thought there is pretty simple. It\u2019s just that: war pushes you into a domain of high uncertainty where the relevance of everything becomes accentuated, because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen next, you don\u2019t know maybe how much food you need to save, or money, or what kind of money, or weapons, or where you need to be \u2014 everything becomes much more relevant when you\u2019re in unexplored territory, so to speak. And that \u2014 and they say, Necessity is the mother of all invention \u2014 it\u2019s like, all of a sudden, you\u2019re pushed by your survival instinct to necessarily figure out all your now very relevant surroundings very quickly. So it accelerates that S-curve adoption, or it accelerates these ideas that may have been idle for some time! All of a sudden there\u2019s a big impetus to figure it out. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now in 2020. We have a war on cash, we have a war on COVID, everyone\u2019s strapped into seclusion, a lot of people are out of work, inflation is right around the corner, so everyone\u2019s been pushed to figure things out and I love that Saylor paints that picture of the war on COVID being an accelerant to Bitcoin and to digital technologies more generally! And finally, I love this quote that he references from Arthur C. Clarke that, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic! All of these modern miracles that we take for granted, they\u2019re all generated from free markets, and if you pull a primitive man out of the Stone Age and brought him here into 2020, he would just be flabbergasted! All of this stuff just looks like magic: this camera, this laptop. And that\u2019s why Bitcoin is so misunderstood \u2014 consider the joke, right? Magic Internet Money! It\u2019s disparaged like that! But what I think it actually is is that it is this radically more innovative and advanced technology that people are just trying to get their head around! And also there in the long run and the great promise of it is to help us make even more magic in the free market! To create even more advanced technologies by eliminating the barriers to trade! Again, tinkerers operating freely in the open marketplace is where we discover all the new and useful things that make life easier and better! And we\u2019ve honored that paradigm to some extent \u2014 especially in Western civilization \u2014 but we\u2019ve erected these artificial barriers to it with fiat currency and central banking and overly complex tax codes, convoluted laws \u2014 all these things are frictions to free trade! So Bitcoin by defunding these inefficient institutions, it\u2019s eroding these barriers to free trade, and therefore bolstering the innovation generated by free markets! So in that sense I think Bitcoin not only is a magic internet money, but it\u2019s going to make the world much more magical in the long run! I hope you guys enjoyed that! That was Episode 3 with Michael Saylor. We\u2019ve probably got 10 episodes total, so we\u2019ll be back soon with the next one. Until then, take care!"}
